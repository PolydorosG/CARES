{"why was this study done?": " ovarian cancer is the name for cancer that originates in the ovary, which is the female reproductive organ that produces eggs and sex hormones. ovarian cancer is a major cause of cancer death in women. epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type of ovarian cancer, and it originates in the cells that cover the outer surface of the ovary. researchers are looking for treatments for ovarian cancer. avelumab is a medicine that may work by targeting a protein called \u201cprogrammed death-ligand 1\u201d (pd-l1) found on the cancer cell. pd-l1 is involved in the body\u2019s immune system response to cancer. when this study was started, avelumab was being tested for use in women with advanced ovarian cancer. although avelumab is approved in other types of cancer, it is not approved for use in ovarian cancer. for women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, the standard treatment includes a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. chemotherapy is often used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain. it can also be used before surgery. this approach is usually effective, but in many cases the cancer comes back. the main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab) both during and/or after standard chemotherapy treatment would increase the amount of time it takes for ovarian cancer to worsen (progress). the study also evaluated the overall safety of avelumab alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study included 3 groups of patients taking platinum-based chemotherapy with no maintenance treatment, platinum-based chemotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance treatment, or platinum-based chemotherapy given together with avelumab then followed by avelumab maintenance treatment. maintenance treatment means a treatment that is given to stop cancer from coming back after it has disappeared following an initial treatment. the study included adult women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer that had spread beyond the pelvis or throughout the body who had not yet received treatment for their advanced cancer. patients in this study must have had a surgery to remove as much cancer as possible. this was an \u201copen-label\u201d study, which means that both the patients and researchers knew which medicines were being given. potential patients were evaluated by the study doctor to make sure they met the criteria to participate in the study. this was known as the \u201cscreening period\u201d, which lasted up to 28 days. next, eligible patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: \uf0b7 group a (335 patients): platinum-based chemotherapy with no maintenance treatment \uf0b7 group b (332 patients): platinum-based chemotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance treatment \uf0b7 group c (331 patients): platinum-based chemotherapy given together with avelumab, then followed by avelumab maintenance treatment patients were assigned to each group by chance. putting people into groups by chance is called randomization. this helps make it more likely that the groups will be more even to compare. the chemotherapy combination of medicines used in this study was paclitaxel and carboplatin. all study treatments were given by intravenous (iv) infusion (a needle into a vein). during the chemotherapy phase, patients received carboplatin every 3 weeks and paclitaxel either every 1 week or every 3 weeks (patient\u2019s doctor allowed to choose). patients in group c also received avelumab every 3 weeks during the chemotherapy phase. during the maintenance phase, patients in groups b and c received avelumab every 2 weeks, and patients in group a received observation only (no study treatments) during this time. the main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab) both during and/or after standard chemotherapy treatment would increase the amount of time it takes for ovarian cancer to worsen (progress). the study also evaluated the overall safety of avelumab alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy. after the last dose of study treatment, there was a 90-day follow-up period that included a monthly safety follow-up. there was a long-term follow-up period, which lasted until patients left the study or the study ended. the figure below shows what happened during this study. the amount of time that patients were in the study varied, but the entire study lasted about 3 years. the sponsor ran this study at 182 locations in 25 countries in asia, europe, and north america. it began on 19 may 2016. 998 women joined the study, and 991 women received study treatment. patients in the study were between the ages of 26 and 86. patients were expected to complete study treatment and a 90-day follow-up period, then enter the long-term follow-up period. the tables below show how many patients completed study treatment, and how many patients did not complete study treatment either by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. in september 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did adding avelumab both during and after standard chemotherapy treatment increase the amount of time it takes for ovarian cancer to worsen (progress)? to answer this question, the researchers compared the progression free survival (pfs), which is the time patients survived without their cancer getting worse. a more easily understood measure is the median pfs, or the estimated time by which half (50%) of the patients would have survived without their cancer getting worse. it is equally likely for a patient to have survived longer than this time without their cancer getting worse as it is that they survived less time without their cancer getting worse. in this study, the estimated median time of survival (pfs) without cancer getting worse for each group was as follows: \uf0b7 group a (platinum-based chemotherapy with no maintenance treatment): at the time that the researchers analyzed the study results, the median time of survival without cancer getting worse in this group could not be estimated because there were too few patients with worsening cancer to make an accurate estimation. \uf0b7 group b (platinum-based chemotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance treatment): 16.8 months \uf0b7 group c (platinum-based chemotherapy given together with avelumab, followed by avelumab maintenance treatment): 18.1 months the study data was reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring board (dsmb). dsmbs are used to ensure the safety of study participants and to determine if it is appropriate for a study to continue. there were no new or unexpected safety issues identified with avelumab alone, or with the combination of avelumab plus paclitaxel and carboplatin. however, the dsmb concluded that there was little to no chance that the trial would demonstrate any benefit when adding avelumab to the standard chemotherapy treatment. the addition of avelumab did not increase the amount of time it takes for ovarian cancer to worsen, and consequently the study was stopped early to give patients an opportunity to seek other treatments. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. in this report, all medical problems that occurred during the study are discussed, regardless of whether or not the study doctors thought that the medical problems were related to taking the study treatment. of the 991 patients who received study treatment, 970 (98%) patients had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 125 (13%) patients stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems. the most common medical problems are listed below.   ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. a total of 267 out of 991 patients (27%) who received study treatment had serious medical problems. 63 patients (19%) in group a, 89 patients (27%) in group b, and 115 patients (35%) in group c had serious medical problems. the most common serious medical problems are listed below. a total of 53 (5%) patients died during the study, including 13 patients (4%) in group a, 19 patients (6%) in group b, and 21 patients (6%) in group c. most of these deaths were due to ovarian cancer, including 11 patients (3%) in group a, 15 patients (5%) in group b, and 17 patients (5%) in group c.
