{"why was this study done?": " what is moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis? ulcerative colitis, or uc, is an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon (large intestine). people with uc can have symptoms like abdominal pain, rectal bleeding (blood in stool), and loose stools. the immune system is a network of white blood cells, tissues, and organs that help the body to fight infections. uc is a type of autoimmune disease. in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks its own tissues for unknown reasons, creating abnormal inflammation (redness and swelling). a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes play a crucial role in this immune reaction. for this study, uc disease activity was determined based on frequency of stools, rectal bleeding, and endoscopy results (an imaging test of the colon and rectum). participants in this study had uc that was determined to be moderately to severely active. what is etrasimod? etrasimod is an investigational drug that is being studied for uc. it is believed that etrasimod works by reducing the number of lymphocytes in the blood and therefore reducing the abnormal inflammation in the gut in people with moderately to severely active uc. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety and the effects of etrasimod on clinical remission in participants with moderately to severely active uc, compared to placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the investigational drug. clinical remission means that the participant has a normal or almost normal frequency of stools, no rectal bleeding, and normal findings on endoscopy (no disease activity). researchers wanted to know: how many participants achieved clinical remission after taking etrasimod or placebo for 12 weeks? how many participants achieved clinical remission after taking etrasimod or placebo for 52 weeks? what medical problems did participants have during the study? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? researchers administered etrasimod or placebo to a group of participants who chose to join the study, to find out if they would achieve clinical remission. researchers compared the results of study participants taking etrasimod to the results of study participants taking placebo. participants received the following treatments during the study: \u2022 etrasimod group (289 participants): 2 milligram (mg) etrasimod tablet, once per day by mouth for up to 52 weeks \u2022 placebo group (144 participants): placebo tablet, once per day by mouth for up to 52 weeks the study participants and researchers did not know who took etrasimod and who took the placebo. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone, which is known as \u201crandomization\u201d. participants were first examined by a doctor to make sure they met the requirements to join the study. this was known as the screening period. there were 2 treatment periods during this study: a 12-week \u201cinduction period\u201d to determine if participants would achieve remission, followed by a 40-week \u201cmaintenance period\u201d to determine how long participants would remain in remission. during the 52 weeks of treatment, participants were expected to attend 12 visits at the study center. at these visits, participants were checked by the study doctor and were monitored for any medical problems. participants also had an endoscopy at the screening visit, week 12 visit, and the last visit, to see if there was an improvement in their uc. at the end of this study, qualifying participants had the option to enter an open-label extension study, which is a study that is sometimes done after a randomized study is completed, to gather additional data and to allow participants to continue receiving etrasimod. open-label means that the study participants and researchers knew which treatment the participants received (in this case, all participants received etrasimod in the extension study). participants who did not join the open-label extension study were expected to attend up to 2 visits after stopping study treatment to check whether they had any medical problems. these are called follow-up visits. the figure below shows what happened during the study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 185 locations in africa, asia-pacific, eastern europe, latin america, the middle east, north america, and western europe. when did this study take place? the study began 13 june 2019 and ended 16 february 2022. who participated in this study? this study included participants who: \u2022 were examined by the study doctor and determined to be appropriate for study participation \u2022 had been diagnosed with moderately to severely active uc \u2022 had an inadequate response, loss of response, or were unable to tolerate certain other marketed treatments for uc \u2022 a total of 240 men (55%) participated in the study \u2022 a total of 193 women (45%) participated in the study \u2022 all participants were between the ages of 17 and 78 years a total of 433participants enrolled in this study, including 289 participants in the etrasimod group and 144 participants in the placebo group. 207 participants (48%) completed the study, including 161 participants (56%) in the etrasimod group and 46 participants (32%) in the placebo group. 226 participants (52%) left the study early. in the etrasimod group, 128 participants (44%) left the study early due to: \u2022 ulcerative colitis worsened (79 participants, 27%) \u2022 the participant\u2019s or parent/guardian\u2019s choice (24 participants, 8%) \u2022 the participant had a medical problem (10 participants, 4%) \u2022 the study treatment did not work for the participant (7 participants, 2%) \u2022 a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study (2 participants, 1%) \u2022 the participant was \u201clost to follow-up\u201d (unable to be contacted by the study staff) (1 participant, less than 1%) \u2022 the participant became pregnant (2 participants, 1%) \u2022 the study procedures were not followed (1 participant, less than 1%) \u2022 other reason (2 participants, 1%) in the placebo group, 98 participants (68%) left the study early due to: \u2022 ulcerative colitis worsened (73 participants, 51%) \u2022 the participant\u2019s or parent/guardian\u2019s choice (10 participants, 7%) \u2022 the participant had a medical problem (5 participants, 4%) \u2022 the study treatment did not work for the participant (4 participants, 3%) \u2022 a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study (2 participants, 1%) \u2022 the participant was \u201clost to follow-up\u201d (unable to be contacted by the study staff) (2 participants, 1%) \u2022 other reason (2 participants, 1%) how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for up to 52 weeks, plus a screening period of up to 28 days and a follow-up period of up to 4 weeks (for those who did not join the open-label extension study). the entire study took about 2 \u00bd years to complete. when the study ended in february 2022, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " how many participants achieved clinical remission after taking etrasimod or placebo for 12 weeks? to answer this question, researchers looked only at participants who had moderately to severely active uc at the beginning of the study, and who achieved clinical remission after taking etrasimod or placebo for 12 weeks. so, the number of participants varies from the total number of participants who joined the study. at week 12, 74 out of 274 (27%) participants in the etrasimod group had achieved clinical remission. at week 12, 10 out of 135 (7%) participants in the placebo group had achieved clinical remission. based on these results, the researchers decided that the outcomes are not likely due to chance. etrasimod may help people with moderately to severely active uc to achieve clinical remission. the figure below shows these results. how many participants achieved clinical remission after taking etrasimod or placebo for 52 weeks? to answer this question, researchers looked only at participants who had moderately to severely active uc at the beginning of the study, and who achieved clinical remission after taking etrasimod or placebo for 52 weeks. so, the number of participants varies from the total number of participants who joined the study. at week 52, 88 out of 274 (32%) participants in the etrasimod group had achieved clinical remission. at week 52, 9 out of 135 (7%) participants in the placebo group had achieved clinical remission. based on these results, the researchers have decided that the outcomes are not likely due to chance. etrasimod may help people with moderately to severely active uc to achieve and maintain clinical remission. the figure below shows these results. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. this is a summary of just some of the main results of this study. other studies that are done with etrasimod may have different results. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. 287 out of 433 (66%) participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem, including 206 out of 289 (71%) participants in the etrasimod group and 81 out of 144 (56%) participants in the placebo group. a total of 19 (4%) participants stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems. the most common medical problems \u2013 those reported by more than 3% of participants \u2013 are described below. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \u2022 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all medical problems reported by more than 3% of participants are listed. \u2022 the 2nd column shows how many of the 289 participants treated with etrasimod reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 289 participants treated with etrasimod who reported the medical problem. \u2022 the 3rd column shows how many of the 144 participants treated with placebo reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 144 participants treated with placebo who reported the medical problem. \u2022 using these instructions, you can see that 24 out of 289 (8%) participants in the etrasimod group reported headache, and 7 out of 144 (5%) participants in the placebo group reported headache.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, the participant needs hospital care, or the participant has lasting problems. a total of 29 (7%) participants had serious medical problems. \u2022 20 (7%) participants in the etrasimod group had serious medical problems. \u2022 9 (6%) participants in the placebo group had serious medical problems. uc flare-up was the most common serious medical problem, which happened in 6 (2%) participants from the etrasimod group and 3 (2%) participants from the placebo group. a total of 2 participants had serious medical problems that the study doctor considered to be related to study treatment: 1 participant in the etrasimod group had a blighted ovum (early pregnancy that never fully develops and typically leads to miscarriage) and 1 participant in the placebo group had a serious skin infection called cellulitis. in clinical studies it is standard practice to record if any deaths took place. no participants died during this study.
