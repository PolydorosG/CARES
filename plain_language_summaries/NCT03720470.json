{"why was this study done?": " atopic dermatitis (ad), also called atopic eczema, is a common skin condition that causes very itchy, red, flaky patches of skin. ad occurs in 10% of adults in the united states. there are currently few approved treatment options in the usa to treat ad, such as dupilumab. these treatments can cause other health problems, or can only be used for short periods of time. researchers are searching for new treatments for ad that can be taken for long periods of time. while researchers think that many things cause ad, it is made worse by the body\u2019s immune system (the body\u2019s defense against infection) causing redness and swelling (inflammation). cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special proteins called \u201ccytokines\u201d that send signals around the body. researchers think that medicines that lower the amount of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with ad. the drug tested in this study was pf-04965842, which now has the generic name abrocitinib. pf-04965842 is an experimental drug that has not been approved for sale yet. pf-04965842 blocks the activity of a protein called \u201cjanus kinase 1\u201d, which acts like an on/off switch for the cells of the immune system. by turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines that are believed to make ad worse. in order to measure the safety and efficacy of abrocitinib treatment for ad, it was compared to treatment with placebo or treatment with the drug dupilumab (dupixent\u00ae). a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine. dupilumab is a medicine that is approved for treating ad. dupilumab blocks the activity of two cytokines, \u201cil-4\u201d and \u201cil-13\u201d that are believed to make ad worse. the researchers wanted to ask, \uf0b7 are patients who take abrocitinib more likely to have their ad improve compared to patients who are treated with a placebo at 12 weeks? \uf0b7 are patients who take abrocitinib more likely to have their ad improve compared to patients who are treated with dupilumab at 16 weeks? to do this, researchers used 2 tests to measure the severity of each patient\u2019s ad at the beginning of the study. while the data in this report was collected in the first 16 weeks, the researchers measured the severity of ad during the 20 weeks of study treatment. the difference in severity was used to decide if a patient\u2019s ad had improved or not. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study compared 4 groups of patients to find out if patients taking abrocitinib had their ad improved compared to patients taking a placebo, or patients taking dupilumab. the study included adult men and women, who were aged 18 years and older. patients included in the study: \uf0b7 had chronic (long-term) ad for at least 1 year, and had moderate to severe ad when they entered the study. \uf0b7 had used other treatments for ad and did not see their ad improve. \uf0b7 had not used other medicine on the skin for ad in the week before starting the study. the patients and researchers did not know who took abrocitinib and who took the placebo. this is known as a \u201cdouble-blinded\u201d study. this is done to make sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone. patients were put into 1 of 4 treatment groups by chance alone (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) to receive either abrocitinib 100 mg, abrocitinib 200 mg, dupilumab, or placebo. patients had a 29% (2 in 7) chance of receiving either abrocitinib 100 mg, abrocitinib 200 mg, or dupilumab, and a 14% (1 in 7) chance of receiving placebo for the study treatment period. this is known as a \u201crandomized\u201d study. this is done to make the groups more similar. reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare. this study used 2 different tests to measure the severity of the patients\u2019 ad at the beginning of the study and throughout 20 weeks of treatment. the first test is called the investigators global assessment (iga) scale and measures the severity of ad on a 5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst). the second test is called the eczema area and severity index (easi), and measures how severe a patient\u2019s ad is based on 4 different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by ad. the difference in each patient\u2019s score between the start of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment was used to decide if their ad had improved. while patients were only in the study for 20 to 24 weeks, the entire study took 16 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 194 locations in 18 countries in the us, poland, republic of korea, japan, australia, bulgaria, canada, germany, united kingdom, latvia, hungary, czech republic, chile, spain, italy, mexico, slovakia, and taiwan. it began 29 october 2018 and ended 06 march 2020. four-hundred nine (409) men and 428 women participated. all patients were 18 years of age or older. the average age of patients in this study was 34 years old. patients were to be treated until the end of the 20 weeks treatment period. of the 838 patients who started the study, 765 patients were continuing the study at week 16. one (1) patient was randomized, but did not receive treatment. twenty-four (24) patients did not finish the study because of medical problems. twenty-three (23) patients left before the study was over by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. in february 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " were patients who took abrocitinib more likely to have their ad improve compared to patients who took placebo at 12 weeks? in this study, more patients in the abrocitinib 100 mg or 200 mg treatment groups had their ad improve compared to the placebo group after 12 weeks. when the change in severity of ad was measured using the investigator\u2019s global assessment scale, 86 out of 235 evaluated patients (37%) in the abrocitinib 100 mg treatment group and 106 out of 219 patients (48%) in the abrocitinib 200 mg treatment group had their ad improve to \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018almost clear\u2019 (score of 0 or 1) and had an improvement of 2 points or more in their ad after 12 weeks. in comparison, 18 out of 129 patients (14%) in the placebo group had their ad improve to \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018almost clear\u2019 after 12 weeks. when the change in severity of ad was measured using the eczema area and severity index, 138 out of 235 patients (59%) in the abrocitinib 100 mg treatment group and 154 out of 219 patients (70%) in the abrocitinib 200 mg treatment group had their ad improve by at least 75% after 12 weeks. in comparison, 35 out of 129 patients (27%) in the placebo group had their ad improve by at least 75% after 12 weeks. these results are also shown in the graphs below. based on these results, the researchers determined that the results are not likely due to chance. abrocitinib may be an option for treating ad in adults. were patients who took abrocitinib more likely to have their ad improve compared to patients who took dupilumab at 16 weeks? in this study, a higher number of patients in the abrocitinib 200 mg treatment group had their ad improve more compared to patients in the dupilumab group after 16 weeks. when the change in severity of ad was measured using the investigator\u2019s global assessment scale, 80 out of 230 evaluated patients (35%) in the abrocitinib 100 mg treatment group and 105 out of 221 patients (48%) in the abrocitinib 200 mg treatment group had their ad improve to \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018almost clear\u2019 (score of 0 or 1) and had an improvement of 2 points or more in their ad after 16 weeks. in comparison, 90 out of 232 patients (39%) in the dupilumab group had their ad improve to \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018almost clear\u2019 after 16 weeks. when the change in severity of ad was measured using the eczema area and severity index, 138 out of 229 patients (60%) in the abrocitinib 100 mg treatment group and 157 out of 221 patients (71%) in the abrocitinib 200 mg treatment group had their ad improve by at least 75% after 16 weeks. in comparison, 152 out of 232 patients (66%) in the dupilumab group had their ad improve by at least 75% after 16 weeks. these results are also shown in the graphs below. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. four-hundred fifty-two (452) out of 837 patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 29 patients left the study because of medical problems. the most common medical problems are listed below.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. fifteen (15) patients had serious medical problems. no patients experienced more than one serious medical problem. of these, 4 patients had serious medical problems considered by the researchers as related to the study medicine. no patients died during the study.
