{"why was this study done?": " non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) is the most common type of lung cancer. in some patients with nsclc, their cancer cells have changes (mutations) in the gene that makes a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor, or \u201cegfr\u201d. these mutations in egfr help stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply. researchers are looking for better treatments for patients with nsclc whose cancer cells have mutations in the egfr gene. dacomitinib (vizimpro\u00ae) is a medicine that has been approved in the united states, japan and european union as treatment for patients with nsclc. at the time of this study, dacomitinib was not yet approved for treatment of patients with nsclc. dacomitinib works by blocking the activity of a group of proteins called the human epidermal growth factor receptor (her) family (including egfr [also known as her1], her2, and her4). these are proteins on the surface of cells that can stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply. by blocking the activity of these proteins dacomitinib may be able to help limit the growth and spread of cancer cells. dacomitinib is given as a tablet once a day to be taken by mouth. the purpose of this study was to provide continued access to dacomitinib for patients who participated in other dacomitinib studies in japan and would be deemed to derive benefit from continued dacomitinib treatment. researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of dacomitinib. they monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study evaluated a group of patients who received dacomitinib in previous studies for advanced nsclc, to have them continue treatment with dacomitinib. the study included patients who had advanced nsclc and who received dacomitinib in a previous study in japan (study a7471009 or study a7471050) without unpleasant side effects based on the researcher\u2019s evaluation. for this study, 3 different dose strengths of dacomitinib oral tablets were planned: \uf0b7 45 mg per day \uf0b7 30 mg per day \uf0b7 15 mg per day the dose strength patients started on in this study, was the same as the dose the patient ended on in the previous study. there were 7 patients included in this study; 5 patients started at a dose of 15 mg once a day and 2 patients started at a dose of 30 mg once a day. this was an \u201copen-label\u201d study, which means that the patients and the researchers knew which medicine the patients received. the figure below shows what happened during the study. the sponsor ran this study in japan. it began 10 july 2015 and ended 30 may 2019. three (3) men and 4 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 68 and 76 and had an average weight of 56 kg. the study doctor was allowed to change the strength of the dacomitinib dose during the study, depending on how the treatment made the patients feel. patients were to be treated until there was evidence of the study drug helping to relief nsclc symptoms, as determined by the study doctor. all 7 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study, of which 3 patients left as dacomitinib became available on the market. when the study ended in may 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " the main purpose of the study was to allow patients with nsclc who received dacomitinib in a previous study, to continue treatment with dacomitinib while their health was monitored. the medical problems that the patients had during this study, is summarized below. more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. all of the 7 patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem. none of the patients left the study because of medical problems. the most common medical problems are listed below. ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. two (2) out of 7 patients (29%) had a total of 3 serious medical problems. no patients died during the study. all serious side effects were considered by the researchers as not related to study medicine. the 3 serious side effects were as follows: \uf0b7 obstruction (blockage) in the digestive system and lung infection by a patient that received 15 mg dacomitinib. \uf0b7 a tumor in the pancreas (gland organ that forms part of the digestive system) by a patient that received 15 mg dacomitinib. ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site. the full scientific report of this study is available online at: www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct02382796 please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which medicines can work and are safe for patients. again, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you helped us to do that!
