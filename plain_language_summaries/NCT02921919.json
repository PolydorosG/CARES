{"why was this study done?": " what is cancer? cancer is the name for a group of diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. most types of cancer cause solid tumors to form, which are masses of these abnormal cells. what is talazoparib? talazoparib (talzenna ) is known as a parp inhibitor. parp inhibitors are drugs \u00ae that inhibit (stop) the normal activity of certain proteins called \u201cpoly (adp-ribose) polymerases\u201d, also called \u201cparps\u201d. parps can be found in all normal and cancer cells, and are involved in the repair of dna. mistakes in the dna can happen when cells divide. if the mistakes are not repaired, the cell will usually die and be replaced. clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other parp inhibitors, may reduce tumor size and slow tumor growth in patients with certain types of cancer. talazoparib is given in a capsule and is taken by mouth once daily at around the same time every day. what was the purpose of this study? talazoparib is now approved in the united states, the european union, and other countries for the treatment of people with a type of cancer known as metastatic breast cancer with brca mutations. this study was done to learn more about the safety of talazoparib when used long term. researchers wanted to know: what medical problems did participants have? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? researchers studied a group of participants to learn more about the safety of talazoparib when used long term. participants with advanced solid tumors who had previously completed a study of talazoparib were invited to join this study. participants received talazoparib once per day by mouth, and were monitored for any medical problems. the starting dose was up to 1 milligram (mg) per day, or the last dose they were able to tolerate in their previous study. participants could continue receiving talazoparib as long as it continued to benefit them, and participants were followed up for 30 days after their last dose of talazoparib. this was an \u201copen-label\u201d study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose the participants received. the figure below shows what happened during the study. where did this study take place? the study was conducted at 24 locations in 9 countries in north america, europe, and central asia. when did this study take place? it began 08 november 2016 and ended 20 july 2021. who participated in this study? this study included adult men and women who had participated in a previous study of talazoparib in advanced solid tumors, and who were able to tolerate a dose of at least 0.25 milligrams (mg) per day. \uf0b7 a total of 37 men (31%) participated \uf0b7 a total of 83 women (69%) participated \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 20 and 93 years a total of 120 participants joined the study, and 118 participants (98%) received talazoparib. the reasons for stopping talazoparib treatment were: \uf0b7 medical problem: 10 participants (8%) \uf0b7 doctor decision: 5 participants (4%) \uf0b7 worsening cancer: 85 participants (71%) \uf0b7 participant decision: 6 participants (5%) \uf0b7 lost contact with participant: 1 participant (1%) \uf0b7 other reason: 11 participants (9%) how long did the study last? the amount of time that participants were in this study varied. the median (middle) amount of time that participants received talazoparib during this study was 3.7 months. the entire study took almost 5 years to complete. when the study ended in july 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. what medical problems did participants have during the study? the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by the study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. a total of 110 out of 118 (93%) treated participants had at least 1 medical problem. nine (8%) participants stopped taking talazoparib because of medical problems. the most common medical problems \u2013 those reported by at least 10% of participants \u2013 are described below. below are instructions for understanding table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all medical problems reported by at least 10% of participants are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 118 participants treated with talazoparib reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 118 participants treated with talazoparib who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that for 39 out of the 118 (33%) participants treated with talazoparib, a low number of red blood cells was reported as a medical problem.  did study participants have any serious medical problems? a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. a total of 45 out of 118 (38%) treated participants had serious medical problems. the most common serious medical problems \u2013 those reported by at least 2% of participants \u2013 are described below. below are instructions for understanding table 2. instructions for understanding table 2. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 2 lists serious medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all serious medical problems reported by at least 2% of participants are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 118 participants treated with talazoparib reported each serious medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 118 participants treated with talazoparib who reported the serious medical problem. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that for 4 out of the 118 (3%) participants treated with talazoparib, a low number of red blood cells was reported as a serious medical problem. a total of 15 out of 118 (13%) treated participants died during this study. worsening cancer was the most common cause of death. no deaths were considered by the study doctors to be related to talazoparib. where can i learn more about this study?
