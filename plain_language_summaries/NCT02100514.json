{"why was this study done?": " heart disease is a leading cause of death in both men and women. one of the biggest risks for getting heart disease is having high \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol (called ldl, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). having high ldl cholesterol can lead to heart disease. doctors prescribe medicines called \u2018statins\u2019 to patients with high ldl cholesterol to lower the ldl cholesterol in the blood. for some people, statins may not lower ldl cholesterol enough. researchers did this study to look for a new way to treat patients who are taking a statin and who still have ldl cholesterol that is higher than what their doctors consider ideal. bococizumab was the medicine tested in this study. it is not a statin. bococizumab is a medicine that is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) that may help to further lower ldl cholesterol. for this study, researchers wanted to answer the question: does bococizumab help to lower ldl cholesterol in patients who take statins but are still at high risk for heart problems? after the primary study had started, the food and drug administration (fda) asked pfizer to do a follow-up study (a substudy). for this substudy, pfizer followed patients for up to 1 year after the first part of the study ended to monitor for medical problems and to see how long it took for certain antibodies to disappear or lower in amount after patients stopped taking bococizumab. antibodies are proteins that fight foreign \u201cinvaders\u201d. in some cases, antibodies can fight against medicines, which make them not work. ", "what happened during the study?": " researchers wanted to know if patients taking a statin who took bococizumab had lower ldl cholesterol than patients who took a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being tested. this study included adult men and women who: \uf0b7 had high cholesterol that required medicine to treat \uf0b7 were already taking a statin treatment for at least 6 weeks, and did not plan to change or stop taking their statin \uf0b7 had a high or very high risk of heart disease because of other health problems, like smoking, diabetes, or damage to their blood vessels patients were assigned either bococizumab or placebo treatment by chance alone. this is known as a \u201crandomized\u201d study. this is done to make the groups more similar for things like age and the number of men and women. reducing differences between the groups makes the groups more even to compare. the patients, study doctors, and sponsor did not know who took what medicine during the study. this is known as a \u201cdouble-blinded\u201d study. researchers use \u201cdouble-blinded\u201d studies to make sure that the results are not influenced in any way. for 4 weeks, patients were checked (screened) to make sure they met all the needs to be in the study. next, patients were put into 1 of the 2 treatment groups and were treated for 1 year. twice as many patients were assigned bococizumab as placebo (a 2:1 ratio). at the end of 1 year, patients were followed by researchers for 6 weeks (follow-up phase) to see how they did after taking the study medicines. while each patient was only in the study for about 14 months, the whole study took almost 2 years to finish. of the 746 patients who started the study, 643 finished the whole study. 103 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. 2 patients died in the bococizumab group, and 2 patients died in the placebo group. study doctors and the sponsor determined that study medicines did not cause their deaths. the study took place at 170 locations in 12 countries in north america and western europe, eastern europe, and asia. it began on 28 october 2014 and ended 15 july 2016. 746 patients started this study. 416 patients were men and 330 patients were women. all patients were between the ages of 26 and 86. as soon as the study ended in july 2016, the sponsor began looking at the study results. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. wwwhhhaaattt wwweeerrreee ttthhheee rrreeesssuuullltttsss ooofff ttthhheee ssstttuuudddyyy???

anti-drug antibodies (adas) can sometimes be made by a patient\u2019s body when taking a biologic medicine, like bococizumab. adas can be neutralizing adas (or nab) and non-neutralizing adas. when nabs are formed, they can make the medicine become less effective. in the main study, patients with adas in general, had the same types of medical problems as patients without adas. however, some patients with adas did have more reactions at the site of injection. in addition, about twice as many patients with nabs had injection site reactions than patients without nabs. in this study, 25% of the patients who participated (33 out of 133) had detectable adas at the last study visit of the original study. of note, 2 of these patients had detectable adas at the start of the original study (before taking any study medicine at all). pfizer wanted to see if the ada level either went down to a certain baseline level, or was not detectable in these patients after they stopped taking bococizumab. they also wanted to see how long it took to get to this level after patients stopped taking bococizumab. the substudy went for up to 1 year after the last visit in the original study. by the end of the substudy, 42% of patients (or 14 of 33) had ada levels that returned to a baseline value or were undetectable. it took on average 170 days for these patients\u2019 ada levels to go to baseline or to be undetectable. 55% of patients (or 18 of 33) still had a positive ada level at the end of the substudy. 1 patient never had a test to check for ada levels during the substudy. see the next page for a summary of the substudy results.  what medical problems did patients have during the study? the researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could have been caused by a study treatment, or by another drug the patient was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. a total of 21 patients left the study due to medical problems (16 in the bococizumab group and 5 in the placebo group). more than half of all patients in this study had at least 1 non-serious medical problem (62% in the bococizumab group and 56% in the placebo group). a non-serious medical problem means a medical problem that is not life-threatening, does not cause lasting problems, or needs hospital care. the most common are listed below. 13% of patients in the bococizumab group (67 out of 499) had a non-serious injection site reaction (pain, stinging, redness, or swelling where the shot was given). less than 1% in the placebo group (2 out of 247) had a non-serious injection site reaction. were there any serious medical problems? serious medical problems during the original study a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or needs hospital care. 44 patients in the bococizumab group (9%, or 44 out of 499 patients) and 32 patients in the placebo group (13%, or 32 out of 247 patients) had serious medical problems. the most common serious medical problems were related to heart disease: \uf0b7 bococizumab group = 2% (12 out of 499 patients) \uf0b7 placebo group = 4% (11 out of 247 patients) 2% or less of patients had other serious medical problems. most of the serious medical problems were only reported by 1 patient. these included serious infections, some cancers, brain or spine problems, problems with their kidneys, liver or digestive organs, low blood sugar, muscle or joint pain, eye or ear issues, blood or vessel problems, breathing trouble, and chest pain not caused by the heart. a total of 4 patients out of 746 died during the study, 2 were in the placebo group and 2 were in the bococizumab group. the study doctors and sponsor determined that none of the deaths were caused by study treatments. what else is important to know? your body makes proteins (called antibodies) to fight foreign \u201cinvaders\u201d, like a virus that can cause an infection. sometimes, the body makes antibodies that attack anything not made by your own body, including some medicines. researchers tested the blood of patients taking bococizumab in 3 different studies, including this one. more than half of all patients tested (55%, or 269 out of 491 patients) were making antibodies against bococizumab. there is the possibility that if you have these antibodies, bococizumab or similar drugs will not work for you in the future. serious medical problems during the substudy 3 patients in the substudy (2%, or 3 of 133 patients) had a total of 5 serious medical problems. none were considered by researchers to be caused by taking the study medicines during the original study. where can i learn more about this study?
