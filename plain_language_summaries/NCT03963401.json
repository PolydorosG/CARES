{"why was this study done?": " what is psoriatic arthritis? psoriatic arthritis (psa) is a type of arthritis that affects some people with the skin condition psoriasis. psoriasis causes skin cells to multiply faster than normal which makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales. psa typically causes affected joints to become swollen, stiff, and painful. psa is thought to happen as a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue and causing lasting inflammation. like psoriasis, psa is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse. what is pf-06700841? pf-06700841 is a medicine that has shown potential in previous studies for the treatment of psoriasis. pf-06700841 stops the functioning of enzymes known as janus kinase 1 (jak1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (tyk2). these enzymes control signals to the immune system cells that produce proteins known as cytokines which cause inflammation. this inflammation is used by the immune system to fight infections that may be caused by viruses or bacteria. in people with psa, the body's immune system begins to attack healthy cells and tissue by causing inflammation. by stopping the function of jak1 and tyk2, pf-06700841 may prevent the abnormal immune system response and inflammation in patients with psa. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of pf-06700841 in participants with active (currently experiencing symptoms) psa after 16 weeks of treatment in comparison with a placebo. after 16 weeks, the purpose of this study was to provide all participants with pf-06700841 to determine the safety and beneficial effect of this medicine after using it for 1 year. \uf0b7 pf-06700841 is a new investigational medicine. a new investigational medicine is one that is currently not approved in a country. \uf0b7 a placebo looks like the study medicine but does not contain any medicine. researchers use a placebo to see if the study medicine works better or is safer than not taking anything. researchers wanted to know: did the participants taking pf-06700841 have better effectiveness in the treatment of psa when compared to placebo? \uf0b7 researchers wanted to determine the american college of rheumatology 20 (acr20) score of participants taking pf-06700841 and compare it to the acr20 score of participants taking placebo after 16 weeks of treatment. \uf0b7 the acr20 score was used to assess and establish the improvement by 20% in tender swollen joints of participants along with a 20% improvement in at least three of the following five factors: o inflammation in joints. o participants treatment response and progress. o doctors\u2019 observations of participants treatment response and progress. o daily pain in joints. o how much psa interferes with the participants daily activities. whether pf-06700841 caused any medical problems in participants? \uf0b7 researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of pf-06700841. \uf0b7 they monitored the participants for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study. ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? researchers tested pf-06700841 on a group of study participants to find out if study participants with psa taking pf-06700841 (the test medicine) had a higher acr20 score than study participants with psa taking placebo. a description of how the study was done can be seen in figure 1 below. figure 1. a description of how the study was done. the acr20 was determined at 16 weeks. the study participants and researchers did not know who took pf-06700841 and who took the placebo. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. the study was only slightly affected by the covid-19 pandemic as the study participants had already completed the treatment portion of the study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 47 locations in 11 countries in australia, asia, and europe. when did this study take place? it began 13 june 2019 and ended 15 january 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who were between the ages of 18 and 75 years old, had symptoms of psa for at least 6 months, and had active psa despite taking anti-inflammatory medications for at least 4 weeks before the start of the study. \uf0b7 a total of 102 men participated \uf0b7 a total of 116 women participated \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 21 and 73 years participants were to be treated until the acr20 scores at the week 16 and week 52 study visits were determined. of the 218 participants who started the study, 203 participants completed the study visit at week 16. of the 203 participants who completed the study visit at week 16, 168 participants completed the study visit at week 52. fifteen participants did not complete the week 16 study visit because: \uf0b7 the participants left the study by their own choice, and/or \uf0b7 the participants did not experience an improvement in their psa, and/or \uf0b7 the participants experienced medical problems after week 16, an additional 35 participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for about 12 months. the entire study took 19 months to complete. when the study ended in january 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did the participants taking pf-06700841 have a better acr20 score in the treatment of psa when compared to placebo? researchers determined the acr20 score for participants with psa taking pf-06700841 and for participants taking placebo at week 16 (figure 2). figure 2. the acr20 score for participants with psa taking pf-06700841 and placebo at week 16 did the study medication have a better effect compared to placebo? at week 16, participants who took the study medication had an acr20 score of: \uf0b7 pf-06700841 10 mg group: 65% \uf0b7 pf-06700841 30 mg group: 67% \uf0b7 pf-06700841 60 mg group: 75% \uf0b7 placebo group: 43% at week 52, participants who took the study medication had an acr20 score of: \uf0b7 pf-06700841 10 mg to pf-06700841 60 mg group: 56% \uf0b7 pf-06700841 10 mg to pf-06700841 30 mg group: 60% \uf0b7 pf-06700841 30 mg group: 70% \uf0b7 pf-06700841 60 mg group: 62% \uf0b7 placebo to pf-06700841 30 mg group: 67% \uf0b7 placebo to pf-06700841 60 mg group: 62% based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of chance. the study medication may have a beneficial effect on participants with psa. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. these are just some of the main findings of this study. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). alternatively, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. one hundred and nineteen out of 218 (55%) participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem in the first 16 weeks of the study. one hundred and sixty out of 218 (73%) participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem by week 52. a total of 3 participants left the study by week 52 because of medical problems. the most common medical problems, those reported by more than 5% of participants, are described in table 1 below. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all medical problems reported by more than 5% of participants are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd to 7th column tells us the number of participants in the groups below who reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the participants taking the study medication who reported the medical problem. o pf-06700841 60 mg group o pf-06700841 30 mg group o pf-06700841 10 mg to pf-06700841 60 mg group o pf-06700841 10 mg to pf-06700841 30 mg group o placebo to pf-06700841 30 mg group o placebo to pf-06700841 60 mg group \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 2 out of the 60 participants in the pf-06700841 60 mg group taking the study medication reported low red blood cell count. (0%) (0%) (0%) (0%) (3%) (0%) (3%) (0%) (0%) (3%) (6%) (0%) (0%) (0%) (0%) (9%) (0%) (6%) (3%) (0%) (0%) (3%) (6%) (0%) (0%) (3%) (6%) (0%) (3%) (9%) (0%) (0%) (0%) (0%) (6%) (6%) (3%) ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. twelve out of 218 participants (6%) had serious medical problems. of the serious medical problems, three events were considered to be related to study medication as follows: \uf0b7 one participant in the pf-06700841 30 mg group had severe ear infection. \uf0b7 one participant in the placebo to pf-06700841 30 mg treatment group had infection of the lung (viral pneumonia). \uf0b7 one participant in the placebo to pf-06700841 60 mg treatment group had infection of the lung (pneumonia) and covid-19 virus. \uf0b7 no participants died during the study.
