{"why was this study done?": " squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in the squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the outer layer of the skin and the mouth, nose, and throat. squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer found in the head and neck. researchers are looking for treatments for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. avelumab is a medicine that may work by targeting a protein called \u201cprogrammed death-ligand 1\u201d (pd-l1) found on the cancer cell. pd-l1 is involved in the body\u2019s immune system response to cancer. when this study was started, avelumab was being tested for use in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. locally advanced refers to cancer that has spread to nearby body tissues. although avelumab is approved in other types of cancer, it is not approved for use in head and neck cancer. the standard treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck includes a combination of radiation therapy and a chemotherapy medicine called cisplatin. the main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab) before, during, and after standard treatment would increase the amount of time it takes for cancer to worsen (progress). the study also evaluated the overall safety of avelumab in combination with standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study included 2 groups of patients taking either: \uf0b7 standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus avelumab \uf0b7 standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus placebo a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine and is given the same way. the study included adult patients who: \uf0b7 had squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (in the mouth or throat) that was locally advanced \uf0b7 had cancer that was likely to spread or come back after treatment \uf0b7 were appropriate to receive standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin \uf0b7 had not yet received treatment for their cancer \uf0b7 had adequate liver, kidney, and bone marrow function the patients and researchers did not know who took avelumab and who took the placebo. this is known as a \u201cdouble-blinded\u201d study. potential patients were evaluated by the study doctor to make sure they met the criteria to participate in the study. this was known as the \u201cscreening period\u201d. next, eligible patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups: \uf0b7 group a (350 patients): standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus avelumab \uf0b7 group b (347 patients): standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus placebo patients were assigned to each group by chance. putting people into groups by chance is called randomization. this helps make it more likely that the groups will be more even to compare before they start receiving the study treatments. avelumab and placebo were given by intravenous (iv) infusion (a needle into a vein). the study included 3 treatment phases: \uf0b7 7-day lead-in phase: patients received a single dose of avelumab or placebo on day 1 \uf0b7 chemoradiotherapy phase: patients received avelumab or placebo on days 8, 25, or 39 plus standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment \uf0b7 maintenance phase: patients received avelumab or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 12 months maintenance treatment means a treatment that is given to stop cancer from coming back after it has been treated in the initial phase. after the last dose of maintenance treatment, there was a 90-day follow-up period that included regular safety assessments. there was a long-term follow-up period, which lasted until patients left the study or the study ended. the figure below shows what happened during this study. patients were expected to be on treatment for about 15 months, but the entire study lasted about 3 years. the sponsor ran this study at 196 locations in 22 countries in asia, australia, europe, and north america. the first patient was enrolled on 12 december 2016. 575 men (82%) and 122 women (18%) joined the study. patients in the study were between the ages of 26 and 86. patients were expected to complete the lead-in, chemoradiotherapy, maintenance, and follow-up phases of the study. the tables below show how many patients completed treatment phases and how many patients did not complete treatment phases either by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study.   in march 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did adding avelumab before, during, and after standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment increase the amount of time it takes for cancer to worsen (progress)? to answer this question, the researchers compared the progression free survival (pfs), which is the time patients survived without their cancer getting worse. at the time the study results were analyzed: \uf0b7 118 out of 350 patients in group a (34%) had their cancer worsen or had died \uf0b7 106 out of 347 patients in group b (31%) had their cancer worsen or had died \uf0b7 there was a 21% higher risk of cancer worsening in patients from group a (avelumab and standard treatment), compared to patients from group b (placebo and standard treatment) the figure below shows the estimated chance of a patient surviving without cancer getting worse, at month 24 of the study: the study data was reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (dmc). dmcs are used to ensure the safety of study participants and to determine if it is appropriate for a study to continue. there were no new or unexpected safety issues identified with avelumab. however, the dmc concluded that there was little to no chance that the trial would demonstrate any benefit when adding avelumab to the standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment. the addition of avelumab did not increase the amount of time it takes for cancer to worsen, and consequently the study was stopped early to give patients an opportunity to seek other treatments. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the patient was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. in this report, all medical problems that occurred during the treatment periods are discussed, regardless of whether or not the study doctors thought that the medical problems were related to taking the study treatment. of the 348 patients in group a who received standard treatment and avelumab, 345 (99%) had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 87 patients in this group (25%) stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems. of the 344 patients in group b who received standard treatment and placebo, 342 (99%) had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 88 patients in this group (26%) stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems. the most common medical problems are listed below.     ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. of the 348 patients in group a who received standard treatment and avelumab, 184 (53%) had serious medical problems. of the 344 patients in group b who received standard treatment and placebo, 175 (51%) had serious medical problems. the most common serious medical problems are listed below. 73 patients in group a (21%) died during the study. 58 patients in group b (17%) died during the study. most of these deaths were due to the cancer itself and not the treatment.
