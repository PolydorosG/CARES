{"why was this study done?": " what is type 2 diabetes mellitus? type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is a disease where the body does not make insulin or does not respond properly to the insulin in the blood. over time, t2dm can cause higher than normal levels of sugar in the blood (hyperglycemia) which can harm the health of people with t2dm. people with t2dm are more likely to develop problems with their kidneys, heart, eyes, and nerves. what is danuglipron? danuglipron (dah-noog-lih-pron, pf-06882961) is an experimental medicine that is taken by mouth and is not yet approved for use by health authorities. danuglipron stimulates the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and may help lower blood sugar levels by increasing insulin secretion. it also increases the feeling of fullness and lowers food intake. what was the purpose of this study? researchers wanted to see if danuglipron helps lower the glycosylated hemoglobin, or \u201chba1c\u201d, levels of participants with t2dm whose blood glucose is not under control with metformin treatment (a medicine approved to treat t2dm) and/or diet and exercise. hba1c is a blood test that measures the level of control of a person\u2019s blood sugar. this report describes what happened during the study, what the results of the study are, and how participants can learn more about the study. researchers wanted to know: did taking danuglipron help lower the participants\u2019 hba1c levels when compared to taking a placebo? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? researchers measured the effect of danuglipron by comparing hba1c levels of participants who took different doses of the study medicine to participants who took a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it but looks just like the medicine being tested. participants were put into 1 of 6 treatment groups by chance alone, like the flip of a coin. this is known as a \u201crandomized\u201d study. randomization is done to make the groups more similar for characteristics like age and sex. in 5 groups the participants received danuglipron and in 1 group participants received a placebo. participants in the 5 groups that received danuglipron were given the study medicine at different doses, depending on which group they were put into. after the screening period, all participants took placebo for 14 days. participants then began taking danuglipron or placebo twice daily for 16 weeks based on which treatment group they were randomized into. this part of the study was \u201cdouble-blinded\u201d. this means the participants and study doctors did not know who was given which treatment during this part of the study. researchers use \u201cdouble-blinded\u201d studies to make sure that the results of the study are not influenced in any way. finally, participants completed a follow-up visit 4 weeks after taking their last dose of danuglipron or placebo. the study design is shown in the graphic on the next page. participants took danuglipron (2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, or 120 mg) or placebo twice a day by mouth in the morning and evening with food. for participants who were assigned to take danuglipron at 40 mg twice daily and above, lower doses of danuglipron were started at the beginning of the study and the dose level was slowly increased, or \u201ctitrated up\u201d to the dose listed in the study design graphic. they continued taking the study medicine along with the same daily dose of metformin they were on before they entered the study for 16 weeks. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 97 locations in 8 countries in north america, europe, and asia. when did this study take place? it began 07 july 2020 and ended 07 july 2021. who participated in this study? the study included adult participants with t2dm who were being treated with metformin and/or diet and exercise who also met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for things such as age, type of diabetes, body mass index (bmi), and total body weight. \uf0b7 a total of 209 men participated \uf0b7 a total of 202 women participated \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 28 and 76 participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus or certain conditions other than diabetes (heart or nerve complications) were excluded from the study. the study doctor confirmed if a patient qualified for the study. participants were to be treated until the end of the 16-week treatment period. of the 411 participants who were treated in the study, 316 participants (77%) finished the double-blind treatment period, and 359 participants (87%) finished the follow-up period. a total of 95 participants (23%) did not finish the double-blind treatment period. the most common reason for not finishing the treatment period was because of medical problems (57 participants, 14%). of the 52 participants (13%) who did not finish the follow-up period, the most common reason was because the participant chose to stop participating (20 participants, 5%). how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for approximately 22 weeks (not including the screening period up to 4 weeks). the entire study took 12 months to complete. when the study ended in july 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did taking danuglipron help lower the participants\u2019 hba1c levels when compared to taking a placebo? researchers found out that at 16 weeks, the participants receiving danuglipron had a greater average drop in hba1c when compared to those receiving a placebo. the results are shown in the graph on the next page. did taking danuglipron help lower hba1c levels compared to taking a placebo? hba1c levels are given in percentages. higher blood sugar levels lead to higher hba1c levels. on average, participants who took danuglipron saw their hba1c levels drop up to 1.2% with the highest dose of 120 mg compared to 0% for the placebo group. based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of chance. danuglipron may help lower hba1c levels in patients with t2dm. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. this is a summary of just some of the main results of this study. other studies may have different results. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. a total of 224 out of 411 participants (55%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 45 participants (11%) stopped study treatment and 12 participants (3%) left the study because of medical problems. the most common medical problems reported by 5% or more of total participants are shown in table 1. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all medical problems reported by 5% or more of total participants are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd \u2013 7th columns tell how many of the participants in each treatment group (treated with danuglipron or placebo) reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the participants taking danuglipron or placebo who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 5 out of the 68 participants (7%) taking danuglipron 2.5 mg twice daily reported nausea. a total of 2 of 66 participants (3%) taking a placebo reported nausea.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. a total of 13 out of 411 participants (3%) treated in the study had serious medical problems. most serious medical problems were not thought to be related to the study treatment. one (1) participant in the danuglipron 80 mg group had a gallbladder problem that the investigator thought might be related to study treatment. a total of 3 participants passed away during the follow-up phase of the study from medical problems due to covid-19. these deaths were not thought to be related to the study drug.
