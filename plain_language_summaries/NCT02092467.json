{"why was this study done?": " what is rheumatoid arthritis? rheumatoid arthritis, or \u201cra\u201d, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. ra is an \u201cautoimmune disease\u201d, which means that patients with ra have an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as the joints. ra can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked. what is tofacitinib? tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. it is an oral (taken by mouth) prescription medicine that is used treat adults with active, moderate to severe ra that did not respond well to medicines known as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards), like methotrexate (\u201cmtx\u201d). tofacitinib may help calm the activity of the immune system and decrease ra signs and symptoms. what was the purpose of this study? researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of 2 different doses of tofacitinib, compared to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (tnf inhibitor). tnf inhibitors are another type of medicine that work to reduce the activity of the immune system. cardiovascular disease is a disease of the heart or blood vessels. researchers wanted to know: how many participants developed cancer? how many participants developed cardiovascular disease? how many participants had medical problems? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. participants who were a good fit were assigned by chance to receive either: \uf0b7 tofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) twice per day by mouth, \uf0b7 tofacitinib 10 mg twice per day by mouth (these participants were later switched to tofacitinib 5 mg twice per day, due to new safety information about tofacitinib), \uf0b7 or a tnf inhibitor (participants in the united states, puerto rico, and canada received adalimumab 40 mg every other week by injection under the skin, participants in other countries received etanercept 50 mg once per week by injection under the skin) this was an \u201copen-label\u201d study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose the participants received. participants were expected to attend visits at the study center for the baseline visit, at month 2, month 3, then every 3 months thereafter, and to complete an end-of-study visit, and an end-of study visit at least 28 days later. the figure below shows what happened during this study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 323 locations in 30 countries in africa, asia, australia, europe, north america, and south america. when did this study take place? it began on 14 march 2014 and ended 22 july 2020. who participated in this study? this study included adult men and women who: \uf0b7 were 50 years of age or older \uf0b7 had moderate to severe ra \uf0b7 had an inadequate response to treatment with methotrexate alone \uf0b7 had at least one additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease \uf0b7 a total of 952 men (22%) participated \uf0b7 a total of 3,410 women (78%) participated \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 50 and 88 participants could continue taking study treatment as long as they continued to benefit from it, or until the study ended. of the 4,362 participants who started the study and received treatment, 3,111 completed it. a total of 1,615 participants stopped taking study treatment early \uf0b7 by their choice, \uf0b7 because they did not see significant improvement in ra symptoms, \uf0b7 because they had a medical problem, or \uf0b7 because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study how long did the study last? the amount of time that each participant was in this study varied. the entire study took more than 6 years to complete. when the study ended in july 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " how many participants developed cancer? to answer this question, the researchers looked at the number of participants from each group who developed any cancer besides non-melanoma skin cancer during the study: \uf0b7 62 out of 1,455 (4%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg developed cancer. \uf0b7 60 out of 1,456 (4%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg developed cancer. \uf0b7 42 out of 1,451 (3%) participants who received a tnf inhibitor developed cancer. how many participants developed cardiovascular disease? to answer this question, the researchers looked at the number of participants from each group who developed cardiovascular disease within 60 days of their last study treatment: \uf0b7 47 out of 1,455 (3%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg developed cardiovascular disease. \uf0b7 51 out of 1,456 (4%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg developed cardiovascular disease. \uf0b7 37 out of 1,451 (3%) participants who received a tnf inhibitor developed cardiovascular disease. different results. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. 3,985 out of 4,362 (91%) participants had at least 1 medical problem within 28 days of their last study treatment: \uf0b7 1,333 out of 1,455 (92%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg had a medical problem. \uf0b7 1,344 out of 1,456 (92%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg had a medical problem. \uf0b7 1,308 out of 1,451 (90%) participants who received a tnf inhibitor had a medical problem. a total of 684 out of 4,362 (16%) participants stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems: \uf0b7 199 out of 1,455 (14%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems. \uf0b7 288 out of 1,456 (20%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems. \uf0b7 197 out of 1,451 (14%) participants who received a tnf inhibitor stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems. the most common medical problems \u2013 those reported by at least 10% of participants \u2013 are described below. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported within 28 days of the last study treatment. all medical problems reported by at least 10% of participants are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 1,455 participants taking tofacitinib 5 mg reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 1,455 participants taking tofacitinib 5 mg who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 the 3rd column tells how many of the 1,456 participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 1,456 participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 the 4th column tells how many of the 1,451 participants taking a tnf inhibitor reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 1,451 participants taking a tnf inhibitor who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 176 out of the 1,455 (12%) participants taking tofacitinib 5 mg reported shingles. a total of 167 out of 1,456 (12%) participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg reported shingles. a total of 55 out of 1,451 (4%) participants taking a tnf inhibitor reported shingles.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 1,047 out of 4,362 (24%) participants in this study had at least 1 serious medical problem within 28 days of their last study treatment: \uf0b7 351 out of 1,455 (24%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg had serious medical problems. \uf0b7 390 out of 1,456 (27%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg had serious medical problems. \uf0b7 306 out of 1,451 (21%) participants who received a tnf inhibitor had serious medical problems. pneumonia was the most common serious medical problem, which happened in 136 (3%) total participants within 28 days of last study treatment, including: \uf0b7 46 out of 1,455 (3%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg. \uf0b7 52 out of 1,456 (4%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg. \uf0b7 38 out of 1,451 (3%) participants who received a tnf inhibitor. a total of 82 participants died during study treatment or within 28 days of their last study treatment: \uf0b7 26 out of 1,455 (2%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg died. \uf0b7 39 out of 1,456 (3%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg died. \uf0b7 17 out of 1,451 (1%) participants who received a tnf inhibitor died.
