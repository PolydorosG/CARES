{"why was this study done?": " what is juvenile idiopathic arthritis? this study was conducted in participants diagnosed with 1 of 3 different types (or subtypes) of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia). jia is an autoimmune condition, which means the immune system that normally helps a person fight an infection instead attacks the person\u2019s own body. in jia, this happens in the joints causing swelling (inflammation) and stiffness. jia is a common autoimmune disease in children and includes a group of conditions that involve joint inflammation that first appears before the age of 16 years and lasts on oligoarthritis \uf0b7 eojia 6 \uf0b7 era tendon, hips, knees, \uf0b7 psa which what is etanercept? etanercept is sold as enbrel\u00ae and is a type of medicine approved for use in adults with active moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (ra), which causes painful, swollen, and stiff joints, active and progressive psa, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, severe ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis are types of arthritis of the backbone that can causes pain and swelling in the back. etanercept is also approved in many countries for the treatment of jia and in some countries for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in children. this study tested to see if etanercept was safe to use over a long time in children and adolescents. what was the purpose of this study? researchers wanted to find out about the safety of etanercept in children and adolescents when it was taken for up to 10 years (2 years in study b1801014 and 8 years in study b1801023). researchers wanted to know: \uf0b7 did participants who took etanercept for up to 10 years develop cancer or have lots of serious medical problems? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? participants in this study had previously been in study b1801014 for approximately 96 weeks and treated with at least 1 dose of etanercept. participants who joined this study could be given further etanercept treatment and all were observed for up to an additional 8 years. the study participants and researchers knew that everyone in the study had taken etanercept. this is known as an open label study. the researchers did this study to find out about the long-term safety of etanercept in children and adolescents. a when the researchers looked for medical problems, they used data they had collected from the 127participants in study b1801014 as well as the data they had collected from the 109 participants who continued etanercept treatment or were observed in study b1801023. b participants treated with etanercept could temporarily stop treatment or restart etanercept throughout the study. if the participant permanently stopped etanercept treatment, they were observed and could not restart etanercept treatment. c the number of participants who left the study were cumulative, which means they were added together so 9 participants left at 2 years and a further 10 participantsleft at 4 years giving the total who left up to 4years as 19, etc. d there were 2 participants whostopped etanercept treatment before 4 years, but these 2 participants were not included in the \u2018temporarily stopped etanercept\u2019, the \u2018restarted etanercept\u2019, or the \u2018observation and no etanercept\u2019 groups. the total number of participants in these groups who were still in the study at 4years was 88 and with the 19 participants who left the study, the total was 107 participants rather than the usual 109participants included at 2, 6, and 8 years. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 36 locations in 19 countries in europe, the russian federation, colombia, mexico, and australia. when did this study take place? it began 10 october 2011 and ended 04 february 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who were children or adolescents with eojia, era, or psa. \uf0b7 a total of 48 boys and young men participated. \uf0b7 a total of 61 girls and young women participated. \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 4 and 19 years. in study b1801014, there were 127 participants who had been in the study for approximately 96 weeks and who had received at least 1 dose of etanercept. of these participants, 109 entered study b1801023 and 18 chose not to enter this long-term study. the participants who entered this long-term study could be treated with etanercept or were regularly assessed for safety for up to an additional 8 years. there were 99 participants who were treated with etanercept and 10 participants who were not treated with etanercept, but who were followed for safety monitoring in this long- term study. of the 109 participants who started this study, 84 finished the study. there were 25 participants who did not finish the study. these participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. how long did the study last? study participants were in this study for up to 10 years (up to 2 years in study b1801014 and up to 8 years in study b1801023). the entire study took up to 10 years to complete. when the study ended in february 2021, the sponsor began reviewing all the information collected. the sponsor then created a final report of the results. this is a summary of that final report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did participants who took etanercept for up to 10 years develop cancer? there was 1 case of cancer in a participant in this study. the participant was diagnosed with hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma after over 2 years of treatment with etanercept in this study and in the original study b1801014. hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma is a cancer of the immune system and is the most common cancer diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. the participant was treated for hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and left the study. the doctor\u2019s thought this participant\u2019s cancer was due to treatment with etanercept and other medicines that are often used to treat autoimmune diseases like ra and psa. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. to do this, the researchers looked to see what medical problems occurred in the 127 participants originally treated in study b1801014 and the medical problems that were seen in the 109 participants who continued in this long-term study during the entire 10-year study period (up to 2 years in study b1801014 and up to 8 years in study b1801023). there were 106 out of the 127 (84%) participants who had at least 1 medical problem if infections and injection site reactions were not counted. the most common medical problems \u2013 those reported by 10% or more participants overall and excluding infections and injection site reactions \u2013 are described below. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all medical problems reported by 10% or more participants are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 127 participants taking etanercept reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 127 participants taking the study medication who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 19 out of the 127 (15%) participants taking etanercept reported joint pain. the researchers also grouped medical problems together to see what different types of medical problems were commonly seen in this study. this showed 111 out of 127 (87%) participants had infections, 45 out of 127 (35%) had problems with their tummy or intestines, 21 out of 127 (17%) participants had infections considered preventable by vaccination in participants not previously vaccinated, and 16 out of 127 (13%) participants had injection site reactions (eg, pain, redness, swelling, and/or itching). a total of 14 participants left the study because of medical problems (11%) if infections and injection site reactions were not counted. ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. there were 39 participants (31%, or 39 out of 127 participants) who had serious medical problems if infections and injection site reactions were not counted. if infections and injection site reactions were counted, then there were 45 participants (35%, or 45 out of 127 participants) who had serious medical problems. none of the different types of serious medical problems occurred in more than 3 participants; most types of serious medical problems were seen in 1 or 2 participants. there was 1 participant in this study who developed hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which is a type of cancer, as discussed previously. no participants died during the study.
