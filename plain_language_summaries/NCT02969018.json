{"why was this study done?": " plaque psoriasis is a disease that can cause a red, scaly rash to form on the skin. the rash may be painful or itchy. plaque psoriasis can also affect other parts of the body, such as the joints or nails. these problems are because the immune system, whose job is to attack foreign invaders like viruses and other germs, mistakenly attacks the body instead. there is no cure for plaque psoriasis at this time, but common treatments include medicines that may control pain, reduce inflammation, and help prevent the immune system from attacking the body. pf-06700841 is a medicine that is being studied as a possible treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. pf-06700841 may help to stop the immune system from attacking the body, and reduce inflammation. because it is still being tested, pf-06700841 has not been approved for use in patients. the main purpose of this study was to find out how pf-06700841 works to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, compared to a placebo. a placebo looks just like the medicine, but doesn\u2019t have any medicine in it. researchers wanted to know: \uf0b7 at week 12 of the study, did patients who took pf-06700841 have an improvement in psoriasis symptoms, compared to patients who took placebo? to answer this question, the researchers used a tool called the pasi (psoriasis area and severity index) to measure plaque psoriasis symptoms. the pasi looks at the redness, thickness, and scaling of the rash, as well as how much of the body is covered by the rash. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study compared patients taking different dose strengths of pf-06700841 to patients taking placebo, to find out if they would have an improvement in psoriasis symptoms. the study included adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. the patients and researchers did not know who took pf-06700841 and who took the placebo. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. putting people into groups by chance helps to make the groups easier to compare. first, patients were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to join the study. this was known as the \u201cscreening period\u201d, which could last up to 6 weeks. during the first part of the treatment period, which lasted 4 weeks, patients received 1 of 3 possible treatments: \uf0b7 30 mg pf-06700841, taken once per day (\u201cqd\u201d) \uf0b7 60 mg pf-06700841, qd \uf0b7 placebo, qd during the second part of the treatment period, which lasted 8 weeks, patients were switched to 1 of 4 possible treatments: \uf0b7 10 mg pf-06700841, qd \uf0b7 30 mg pf-06700841, qd \uf0b7 100 mg pf-06700841, taken once per week (\u201cqw\u201d). these patients also received a placebo medicine on the days that they did not take pf-06700841, so that the study would stay blinded. \uf0b7 placebo, qd the last part of the study was a follow-up period, which lasted for 8 weeks after the patients finished taking study treatment. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. while patients were only in the study for up to 26 weeks, the entire study took more than 15 months to complete, because patients joined the study at different times. the sponsor ran this study at 34 locations in canada, poland, and the united states. it began 01 december 2016 and ended 19 march 2018. 148 men (70%) and 64 women (30%) participated. all patients were between the ages of 18 and 75. patients were to be treated for 12 weeks and complete the 8-week follow-up period. of the 212 patients who started the study, 164 finished the study. a total of 48 patients left before the study was over by their choice, because they had a medical problem, or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. when the study ended in march 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " at week 12 of the study, did patients who took pf-06700841 have an improvement in psoriasis symptoms, compared to patients who took placebo? on average, patients who took pf-06700841 in this study had a greater improvement in psoriasis symptoms, compared to those who only took placebo. on average, patients who took the following treatments had a \u201cstatistically significant\u201d improvement in psoriasis symptoms, which means that the researchers decided the improvement in symptoms is not likely a result of chance: on average, patients who took the following treatments did not have a \u201cstatistically significant\u201d difference in their symptoms, compared to patients who took placebo. this means although these patients may have seen an improvement in their symptoms, the differences seen could have been due to chance. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. 149 out of 212 (70%) patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 14 (7%) patients stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems. nine (9) of these patients (4%) had medical problems that were considered related to study treatment, including 1 patient who became pregnant and the fetus had a condition in which the lip did not develop properly. the most common medical problems are listed below. medical problem acne back bronchitis diarrhea feeling irritable feeling tired headache hot infection the throat, airways itching joint low number a white blood nausea sinus infection sore sore, cracked lips sprain the that connects the and throat pain urinary tract infection vomiting worsening psoriasis ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. a total of 5 out of 212 patients (2%) had serious medical problems. these 5 patients received pf-06700841 during the study. two (2) of the patients (1%) had serious medical problems that were determined to be related to study treatment. the serious medical problems are listed below. serious medical problem low number red cells chest caused reduced blood to chest pneumonia extreme response infection (sepsis) gunshot wound one (1) patient died after leaving the study early. this death was not related to study treatment. ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site. www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct02969018 please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which medicines can work and are safe for patients. again, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you helped us to do that!
