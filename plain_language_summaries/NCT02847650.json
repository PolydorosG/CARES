{"why was this study done?": " parkinson\u2019s disease is a disease of the nervous system that affects movement. patients with parkinson\u2019s disease can have many symptoms, such as weakness, tremor, stiff muscles, and slowed movements. these are known as \u201cmotor symptoms.\u201d the symptoms of parkinson\u2019s disease usually develop slowly over several years. doctors aren\u2019t sure exactly what causes parkinson\u2019s disease, but it occurs when certain nerve cells in the brain die. these nerve cells are found in the part of the brain that controls movement, and they make a chemical called \u201cdopamine.\u201d many medicines used to treat parkinson\u2019s disease work by increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain, which could help decrease parkinson\u2019s symptoms. pf-06649751 was studied as a possible treatment for parkinson\u2019s disease. the main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of pf-06649751 in patients with parkinson\u2019s disease who were at an early stage of the disease. researchers wanted to answer this question: \uf0b7 did motor symptoms decrease in patients who received pf-06649751, compared to patients who received placebo? a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if motor symptoms would decrease in patients taking pf-06649751, compared to patients taking placebo. the study included patients with early stage parkinson\u2019s disease who had motor symptoms. to be eligible to join the study, patients must not have used a dopamine medicine for longer than 28 days, or within 7 days of beginning the study. patients in this study were assigned to receive either pf-06649751 or placebo. the patients and researchers did not know who took pf-06649751 and who took the placebo. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. patients were assigned to each treatment group by chance alone. this is known as a \u201crandomized\u201d study. putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be compared. first, patients were checked by a study doctor to make sure they met the requirements to join the study. this was called the screening period, which lasted 30 days. during the treatment period, which lasted 15 weeks, patients received either pf-06649751 or placebo. the treatment period included 2 parts: \uf0b7 9-week \u201cdose optimization period\u201d. during this part of the study, the dose was gradually increased each week, as tolerated by the patient. the target dose was 3 to 15 milligrams of pf-06649751 or matching placebo, taken each day. \uf0b7 6-week \u201cmaintenance period\u201d. during this part of the study, patients were to receive the target dose of pf-06649751 or matching placebo each day. during the treatment period, patients had study appointment visits to be checked by study doctors to determine if motor symptoms were improving. patients were also asked about any medical problems they were having. finally, patients came to 2 follow-up visits after their last dose of pf-06649751 or placebo, at week 17 and week 19. this study ended early in january 2018, because another study that was being done with pf-06649751 did not show benefit for patients with parkinson\u2019s disease. so, the sponsor decided to stop this study, as well. however, patients who were already enrolled in the study were allowed to complete it. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. patients were in this study for up to 23 weeks, but the entire study took more than 15 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 23 locations in germany, france, israel, and the united states. it began 17 october 2016 and ended 29 january 2018. 34 men (60%) and 23 women (40%) joined the study and received study treatment. all patients were between the ages of 45 and 79 years. patients were to complete the 15-week treatment period and then enter a 28-day follow-up period. of the 57 patients who started the study and received study treatment, 54 patients (95%) completed the follow-up period. however, a total of 10 out of 57 patients (18%) stopped taking study treatment early by their choice or because they had a medical problem. when the study ended early in january 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did motor symptoms decrease in patients who received pf-06649751, compared to patients who received placebo? to answer this question, the researchers used a rating scale designed to measure parkinson\u2019s disease symptoms. the researchers looked to see if patients would have a change in their rating scale score from before they started study treatment (baseline) to after they finished study treatment (week 15). on average, patients who received pf-06649751 had a rating scale score change of -9 units, while patients who received placebo had a rating scale score change of -4.3 units. so, on average, symptoms decreased more in patients who received pf-06649751 compared to patients who received placebo. the researchers have determined that these results are not likely based on chance. the figure below shows these study results. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study. more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. 43 out of 57 patients (75%) had at least 1 medical problem, including 25 out of 29 patients (86%) who received pf-06649751 and 18 out of 28 patients (64%) who received placebo. a total of 6 patients (11%) stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems, including 2 patients who received pf-06649751 and 4 patients who received placebo. the most common medical problems are listed below.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 1 patient (2%) had a serious medical problem (thoughts of suicide), which the study doctor determined was related to study treatment. this patient was in the pf-06649751 group. no patients died during the study. ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site. the full scientific report of this study is available online at: www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct02847650 www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu use the study identifier 2016-001575-71 please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which medicines can work and are safe for patients. additional clinical trials with pf-06649751 are planned. again, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you helped us to do that!
