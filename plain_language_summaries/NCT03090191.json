{"why was this study done?": " what is cloistridioides difficile infection? cloistridioides difficile (previously called clostridium difficile and also known as c. difficile) is a germ or bacteria that can be found in the bowel of some people. c. difficile infections can range from a person not showing any symptoms or having mild diarrhea, to more serious complications such as severe diarrhea and life-threatening damage to the bowel. c. difficile infection mostly affects people who have recently been treated with antibiotics, have had to stay in a healthcare setting (such as a hospital or nursing home) for a long time, are over 65 years old, or have a weakened \u201cimmune system\u201d because of other illnesses. the immune system is what defends the body from germs like c. difficile. what is c. difficile vaccine (pf-06425090)? vaccines work by helping the body to fight infections and prevent diseases. the c. difficile vaccine used in this study (pf-06425090) is an investigational vaccine which means it has not been approved for general use. there are currently no approved vaccines to prevent c. difficile infection. in this study, the c. difficile vaccine was given as 3 doses of 200 micrograms each. each dose was given by injection into a muscle. previous studies have already shown that pf-06425090 can produce an immune system response against c. difficile in humans when given as 3 doses at dose levels up to 200 micrograms. what was the purpose of this study? there were 2 main purposes for this study. one purpose was to learn about the safety of the c. difficile vaccine. the second purpose was to see if the c. difficile vaccine helped to prevent c. difficile infection in adults aged 50 years and older. researchers wanted to know: 1. did the c. difficile vaccine help to reduce the number of new episodes of c. difficile infection? 2. how many participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days of vaccination or placebo injection? 3. how many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, vomiting, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days of vaccination or placebo injection? 4. how many participants had medical problems during the study? what happened during the study? how was the study done? this study compared 2 groups of participants to find out if people given the c. difficile vaccine reacted differently compared to people given a placebo (saline injection). a placebo does not have any medicine in it but looks just like the medicine being tested. the study participants and researchers did not know who received the c. difficile vaccine and who received placebo. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. this is known as a \u201crandomized\u201d study. this is done to make the groups similar, which then makes comparing the results between the groups more fair. a total of 17,535 participants joined the study; 8766 were assigned to the c. difficile vaccine group and 8769 participants were assigned to the placebo group. the figure below shows what happened during the study. figure 1. ", "what happened during the study?": " the first injection of c. difficile vaccine or placebo was given at day 1 (dose 1). the second injection was given at month 1 (dose 2) and the third injection was given at month 6 (dose 3). if a participant had diarrhea 3 or more times in a 24-hour period at any time during the study, the participant collected a stool sample for testing and an in-person visit was triggered. a blood sample was taken at this additional visit. in this study, researchers looked at the number of new c. difficile infections starting at 14 days after dose 2 and starting at 14 days after dose 3. a \u201cnew\u201d infection meant the participant had no episodes of c. difficile infection in the past. a c. difficile infection was defined as either: \uf0b7 diarrhea 3 or more times in a 24-hour period plus a stool sample testing positive for c. difficile; or \uf0b7 inflammation of the bowel diagnosed by a doctor to be caused by c. difficile plus a stool sample testing positive for c. difficile where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 410 locations in 23 countries in 5 regions in the world (east-asia, europe, north america, oceania and south america). when did this study take place? it began 29 march 2017 and ended 21 december 2021. who participated in this study? the study included 17,535 men and women who were at least 50 years old and who were at risk of developing a c. difficile infection. \uf0b7 a total of 8467 men (49%) were given c. difficile vaccine or placebo \uf0b7 a total of 8973 women (51%) were given c. difficile vaccine or placebo \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 50 and 97 a total of 95% of participants received dose 2, and 90% of participants received dose 3. a total of 36% of participants left before the study was over. the most common reasons for leaving the study early were the participant\u2019s choice (24% of participants), lost to follow-up (4% of participants), or the participant passed away for any reason (4% of participants). lost to follow-up means that the participant did not return for study visits and did not respond to phone calls from the study site staff. how long did the study last? study participants were in the vaccination phase of the study for up to 6 months. the entire study, from the time of consent to the last follow-up, took about 4 years and 8 months to complete. when the study ended in december 2021, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did the c. difficile vaccine help to reduce the number of new episodes of c. difficile infection? the number of new episodes of c. difficile infection measured after dose 2 or after dose 3 of the c. difficile vaccine or placebo are shown in figure 2 and figure 3. figure 2. number of new episodes of c. difficile infection after dose 2 figure 3. number of new episodes of c. difficile infection after dose 3 in this study, the c. difficile vaccine was 29% effective at preventing new episodes of c. difficile infection starting at 14 days after dose 2. the c. difficile vaccine was 31% effective at preventing new episodes of c. difficile infection starting at 14 days after dose 3. the researchers have decided that these results may be the result of chance. this means the study results did not show that the c. difficile vaccine was better than placebo at preventing new episodes of c. difficile infection. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. this is a summary of just some of the main results of this study. other studies may have different results. how many participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days of vaccination or placebo injection? the graphs in figure 4 show the percentage of participants in each group with any redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days after getting any dose (dose 1, 2, or 3) of c. difficile vaccine or placebo. most participants reported these effects were mild or moderate. figure 4. percentage of participants with redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days after any dose how many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, vomiting, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days of vaccination or placebo injection? the graphs in figure 5 show the percentage of participants in each group with any fever, tiredness, headache, vomiting, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after getting any dose (dose 1, 2, or 3) of c. difficile vaccine or placebo. most participants reported these events were mild or moderate. figure 5. percentage of participants with fever, tiredness, headache, vomiting, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after any dose ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. from dose 1 up to 1 month after dose 3, 8211 participants (47%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem. this included 4161 participants (48%) in the c. difficile vaccine group, and 4050 participants (46%) in the placebo group. a total of 543 participants (3%) left the study because of medical problems, including 291 participants (3%) in the c. difficile vaccine group and 252 participants (3%) in the placebo group. the table below describes the most common medical problems \u2013 those reported by at least 1% of participants in any group from dose 1 up to 1 month after dose 3. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study from dose 1 up to 1 month after dose 3. all medical problems reported by at least 1% of participants in any group are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 8722 participants given the c. difficile vaccine reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 8722 participants given the c. difficile vaccine who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 the 3rd column tells how many of the 8718 participants given placebo reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 8718 participants given placebo who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 269 out of the 8722 (3%) participants given the c. difficile vaccine reported a fall. a total of 292 out of the 8718 (3%) participants given placebo reported a fall.   ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. a total of 2206 participants (13%, or 2206 out of 17,440 participants) had serious medical problems from dose 1 up to 6 months after dose 3. this included 1116 participants (13%) in the c. difficile vaccine group and 1090 participants (13%) in the placebo group. most of the serious medical problems were not thought to be related to taking the study vaccine. lung infection was the most common serious medical problem. this happened in 70 participants in the c. difficile vaccine group and in 63 participants in the placebo group (less than 1% of participants). researchers believe that 6 participants (less than 0.1%) in the c. difficile vaccine group and 1 participant (less than 0.1%) in the placebo group had serious medical problems that were related to the study vaccine. none of the \u201crelated\u201d serious medical problems were reported in more than 1 participant each. a total of 731 participants (4%, or 731 out of 17,440 participants) died during the study. this included 369 participants (4%) in the c. difficile vaccine group and 362 participants (4%) in the placebo group.
