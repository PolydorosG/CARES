{"why was this study done?": " chronic low back pain is pain in the lower back that lasts for 3 months for more. doctors can prescribe medicines to manage this pain, but these medicines may not work well for all patients, so researchers are looking for additional treatment options. tanezumab was evaluated in patients with chronic low back pain. tanezumab is not approved for use in patients. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about how tanezumab works to treat chronic low back pain symptoms. the researchers wanted to answer this question: \uf0b7 did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in chronic low back pain symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo? a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study compared 4 groups of patients to find out if patients taking tanezumab would have an improvement in chronic low back pain symptoms. to answer the research question, the researchers asked patients to rate their lower back pain each day, on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). the study included adult patients with chronic lower back pain that has been going on at least 3 months, who did not get adequate pain relief from certain other pain medicines. these patients had a back pain rating of 5 or more, on a scale from 0 to 10, at the beginning of the study. first, patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were appropriate to join the study. this was known as the \u201cscreening period\u201d, which lasted up to 37 days. during this time, x-rays of the knees, hip joints, and shoulder joints were taken, and lower back pain was assessed. the next part of the study was the \u201ctreatment period\u201d, which lasted up to 56 weeks. the treatments used in this study included: \uf0b7 tanezumab 5 mg, given as an injection under the skin every 8 weeks \uf0b7 tanezumab 10 mg, given as an injection under the skin every 8 weeks \uf0b7 a placebo that looks like tanezumab, given as an injection under the skin every 8 weeks \uf0b7 a medicine called tramadol that is used to treat chronic lower back pain, given as a pill by mouth every day \uf0b7 a placebo pill that looks like the tramadol pill, taken by mouth every day patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be compared. each group received the following treatments: \uf0b7 group 1: placebo injection + placebo pill for the first 16 weeks. after 16 weeks, patients were switched to tanezumab 5 mg or 10 mg injections, + placebo pill \uf0b7 group 2: tanezumab 5 mg injection + placebo pill \uf0b7 group 3: tanezumab 10 mg injection + placebo pill \uf0b7 group 4: tramadol pill + placebo injection the patients and researchers did not know who took the tanezumab injection or the placebo injection and who took the tramadol pill or the placebo pill, since these treatments looked the same. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. at study visits in the clinic, starting at the screening visit, the patients completed questionnaires about their low back pain. they also let the staff know about illnesses and discomforts, and had assessments (like physical exam, blood pressure, and more) done by the study doctors and other qualified personnel. during the study visits for week 16 and week 32, the study doctor assessed whether the patients should continue in the study, based on their low back pain ratings. to continue in the study, patients should have at least 30% improvement in pain ratings after 16 weeks of treatment. patients who did not have at least 30% improvement stopped study treatment and entered the follow-up period. the follow-up period lasted 24 weeks. during this time, the study doctors monitored the patients for any medical problems. the figure below shows what happened during this study. each patient participated in the study for up to 80 weeks, and the entire study took about 3\u00bd years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 191 doctor\u2019s offices and clinics in europe, asia, and north america. it began 18 august 2015 and ended 20 december 2018. 784 men (43%) and 1041 women (57%) participated. all patients were between the ages of 19 and 84. patients were to be treated for up to 56 weeks and complete the 24-week follow-up period. a total of 1825 patients joined the study and received study treatment. of these patients, 1181 (65%) finished the study. there were 644 patients (35%) who left before the study was over by their choice or because they had a medical problem and a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. when the study ended in december 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in chronic lower back pain symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo? to answer this question, the researchers looked at the patients\u2019 low back pain ratings from before the start of study treatment up to week 16 to see if there was an improvement. on average, patients who received tanezumab 10 mg had a greater improvement in chronic low back pain symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo. the researchers have decided that these results are not likely a result of chance. on average, patients who received tanezumab 5 mg also had a greater improvement in chronic low back pain symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo. however, this improvement was not large enough to show that one treatment was more effective than another. this difference could have been due to chance. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. during the treatment period, 615 out of 1008 patients who received tanezumab (61%) had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 15 patients (1%) left the study during the treatment period because of medical problems. the most common medical problems during the treatment period are listed below. ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. a total of 34 out of 1008 patients (3%) who received tanezumab had serious medical problems during the treatment period, including 1 patient (1%) who received placebo followed by tanezumab 5 mg, 10 patients (2%) who received tanezumab 5 mg, 8 patients (8%) who received placebo followed by tanezumab 10 mg, and 15 patients (4%) who received tanezumab 10 mg. 7 patients died during the study period of 80 weeks. none of these deaths were considered to be related to the study treatment by the study doctors. ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site. the full scientific report of this study is available online at: www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct02528253 www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu use the study identifier 2012-005495-34 please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which medicines can work and are safe for patients. an additional study with tanezumab is currently ongoing. again, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you helped us to do that!
