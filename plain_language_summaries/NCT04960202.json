{"why was this study done?": " what is covid-19? coronavirus disease (covid-19) led to a global pandemic starting in 2019. covid-19 is caused by a virus that is easily spread. some people who have covid-19 don\u2019t show any symptoms, while others have symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. although most cases of covid-19 are mild, some people are at a higher risk of getting sicker. covid-19 can quickly become very serious and result in hospitalization or even death. what are nirmatrelvir and ritonavir? the study medication paxlovid\u2122 consists of 2 medicines called nirmatrelvir (tablets) and ritonavir (a capsule). these tablets and capsule are swallowed together. \uf0b7 nirmatrelvir (nir-muh-trel-veer) is a study medicine. it can stop a specific type of enzyme in the virus that causes covid-19 from working. enzymes are proteins that speed things up in our cells. if this enzyme stops working, the covid-19 virus cannot multiply and spread through the body. \uf0b7 ritonavir (rih-tahn-uh-veer) is a medicine that can help increase the levels of other medicines in the body. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of the study was to see if nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was more effective than placebo for preventing severe covid-19 (requiring hospitalization or leading to death). a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks like nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. researchers studied nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to see if it could help prevent covid-19 from becoming severe. researchers also wanted to find out if the medicine caused any unwanted medical problems (also known as side effects). researchers wanted to know: did the participants taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have a lower chance of being hospitalized with covid-19 or passing away due to any cause than those taking placebo? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? researchers tested nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on a group of study participants. researchers wanted to find out how many participants taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were hospitalized due to covid-19. they also recorded how many participants passed away due to any cause. researchers compared the results of study participants taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to the results of study participants taking a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks like nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. the study participants and researchers did not know who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and who took the placebo. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. study participants were assigned to take nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or placebo by chance alone. this is known as a \u201crandomized\u201d study, and it helps make the treatment groups similar and more even to compare. the study included participants who were at a higher risk of getting severe covid-19, such as people who were older or had diabetes. as shown in the figure, there were a total of 2246 participants who entered the study. of these participants, 1120 participants were given nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and 1126 participants were given placebo: figure 1. overall study design the researchers looked at 2 groups of participants who started treatment within 3 days or 5 days of their covid-19 symptoms starting: \uf0b7 group 1 started treatment within 3 days of their covid-19 symptoms starting. this group included 697 participants who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 682 participants who took the placebo. they took this medication twice a day for 5 days. \uf0b7 group 2 started treatment within 5 days of their covid-19 symptoms starting. this group included 1039 participants who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 1046 participants who took the placebo. they also took this medication twice a day for 5 days. participants then had follow-up visits up to 24 weeks after starting treatment. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 343 locations in 21 countries around the world. when did this study take place? it began 16 july 2021 and ended 26 april 2022. who participated in this study? the study included participants who tested positive for covid-19 and were showing symptoms. they weren\u2019t in the hospital yet but were at a higher risk of progressing to more severe illness that could result in hospitalization. \uf0b7 a total of 1148 men participated \uf0b7 a total of 1098 women participated \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 18 and 88 years. of the 2246 participants who started the study: \uf0b7 2084 participants completed the study. \uf0b7 162 participants left before the study was over. the most common reason for leaving the study was because the participant left the study by their choice. how long did the study last? study participants were treated for 5 days and were followed in the study for up to 24 weeks. the entire study took about 9 months to complete. when the study ended in april 2022, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did the participants taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have a lower chance of being hospitalized with covid-19 or passing away due to any cause than those taking placebo? compared to placebo, participants who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within 3 days of their symptoms starting were 89% less likely to be hospitalized due to covid-19 or to pass away for any reason. participants who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within 5 days of getting symptoms were 86% less likely to be hospitalized due to covid- 19 or to pass away for any reason. figure 2. participants who were hospitalized with covid-19 or passed away due to any cause twelve (12) participants in the placebo group had passed away by day 28. later, by week 24, a total of 15 participants who took placebo had passed away. no participants who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir passed away during the study (through the week 24 visit). based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of chance. nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may help lower the risk of hospitalization and death in patients who are at a higher risk for severe covid-19. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. this is a summary of just some of the main results of this study. other studies may have different results. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. the researchers reviewed the medical problems in 2224 participants who got at least 1 dose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or placebo. overall, 526 out of 2224 (24%) participants had at least 1 medical problem by day 34 of the study. this included 256 participants who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 270participants who took placebo. table 1 shows the most common medical problems \u2013 those reported by 2% or more of participants in either treatment group. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all medical problems reported by more than 2% of participants are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 1109 participants taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 1109 participants taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 the 3rd column tells how many of the 1115 participants taking a placebo reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 1115 participants taking a placebo who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 62 out of the 1109 (6%) participants taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir had a change in their sense of taste. a total of 3 out of the 1115 (less than 1%) participants taking a placebo had a change in their sense of taste.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. ninety-three (93) out of 2224 participants (4%) had at least 1 serious medical problem. most serious medical problems were due to covid-19. \uf0b7 nineteen (19) participants who took nirmatrelvir /ritonavir had at least 1 serious medical problem. \uf0b7 seventy-four (74) participants who took placebo had at least 1 serious medical problem. one participant who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir had serious medical problems that the study doctor thought might be related to the ritonavir (chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, and heart palpitations). study doctors did not think that any of the serious medical problems were related to taking nirmatrelvir. no participants who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir passed away during the study. a total of 15 participants who took placebo passed away during the study. fourteen (14) of the 15 participants in the placebo group who passed away during the study died from complications of covid-19.
