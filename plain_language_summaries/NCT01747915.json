{"why was this study done?": " epilepsy is a condition in which a person has recurring seizures. epilepsy occurs in both adults and children and can affect multiple daily life activities. a seizure is a sudden increase in electrical activity in the brain. seizures can cause many different symptoms, such as shaking, feeling confused, or losing control of your body. when a seizure occurs throughout the whole brain, it is known as a generalized seizure. the most common type of generalized seizure is a primary generalized tonic-clonic (pgtc) seizure. this is a disturbance in the functioning of both sides of the brain. participants were asked to take part in this research study because they were diagnosed with epilepsy with pgtc seizures. pregabalin is the medicine that was used during this study. pregabalin is prescribed by doctors for the treatment of another type of seizure that was not part of this study, called partial onset seizures, in young children and adults. the purpose of this study was to find out how 2 strengths of pregabalin work to treat pgtc seizures, compared to placebo. a placebo looks like the study drug but does not contain any active ingredient. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. in this document, pregabalin and placebo will be referred to as \u201cstudy drug\u201d. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study evaluated 3 groups of participants to find out which study drug may be better for treating pgtc seizures: \uf0b7 pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day, or 5 milligrams for each kilogram of body weight per day, to a maximum of 300 mg per day \uf0b7 pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day, or 10 milligrams for each kilogram of body weight per day, to a maximum of 600 mg per day \uf0b7 placebo the study included participants between the ages of 5 and 65 years who were diagnosed with epilepsy with pgtc seizures. all of these participants were already taking 1 to 3 other treatments for epilepsy (antiepileptic drugs to help prevent seizures) in addition to pregabalin or placebo. participants continued to take their other antiepileptic drugs during the study. in this summary, results will be described by whether the participant was taking pregabalin or placebo, although participants were also taking other antiepileptic drugs. participants were assigned to each group by chance alone (like the flip of a coin). this is known as a \u201crandomized\u201d study. this is done to make the groups more similar, which makes comparing the groups more fair. the participants and researchers did not know who took pregabalin and who took placebo. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. this was done to make sure the results of the study could not be unfairly influenced by anyone. in case of urgent need, the study team could learn quickly which study drug the participants were receiving. the sponsor ran this study at 70 locations in 21 countries that included: austria, belarus, bosnia and herzegovina, bulgaria, china, france, greece, hungary, india, south korea, malaysia, montenegro, poland, romania, russian federation, serbia, slovakia, turkey, ukraine, united kingdom, and united states. it began 03 april 2013 and ended 20 february 2019. a total of 98 (45%) males and 121 (55%) females participated. participants were in the study for a total of 21 weeks. in the first 8 weeks of the study (baseline), participants had tests and filled out forms to see if they qualified for the study. participants were then to be treated for 13 weeks and then had the option to continue in the open-label study (the participants and researchers know who is taking which study drug), which is a separate study and not discussed in this report. a total of 85% (187 of 219) of the participants who started the study finished the study. a total of 15% (32 of 2019) of the participants did not finish the study because they left before the study was over by their choice, a doctor decided it was best that they stop the study, and 1 participant who received placebo died due to epilepsy. when the study ended in february 2019, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did participants who took pregabalin have an improvement in seizure symptoms, compared to participants who took placebo? no, participants who took pregabalin did not have an improvement in seizure symptoms compared to participants who took placebo. results could have been due to chance. the main goal (or primary objective) was to see if pregabalin reduced the number of seizures, compared to placebo. researchers compared the changes in a participant\u2019s number of seizures when they were being treated with pregabalin or placebo. in this study, on average, participants who took 5 mg/kg/day pregabalin had 2% more seizures than participants who took placebo. participants who took 10 mg/kg/day pregabalin had 1% fewer seizures than participants who took placebo. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. a total of 53% (40 out of 75) of participants who took pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day had at least 1 medical problem, 57% (41 out of 72) of participants who took pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day had at least 1 medical problem, and 50% (36 out of 72) of participants who took placebo had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 17 participants left the study because of medical problems. the most common medical problems are listed below. ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. a total of 7 participants had serious medical problems: 3% (2 out of 75) of participants in the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group, 3% (2 out of 72) of participants in the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group, and 4% (3 out of 72) of participants in the placebo group had serious medical problems. there was 1 participant who received placebo and died during the study due to epilepsy. the study doctor said that the death was not related to the study medicines. ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site. for more details on this study protocol, please visit: www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct01747915 www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu use the study identifier 2010-023263-18 please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which medicines can work and are safe for participants. again, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you helped us to do that!
