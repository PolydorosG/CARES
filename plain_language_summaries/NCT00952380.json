{"why was this study done?": " \u201cvenous thromboembolism\u201d, or vte, is the name for a blood clot that forms in the body. vte can happen in a vein located in different parts of the body, including the legs, the arms, the groin, the lungs, or other parts of the body. a vte can be life-threatening if not treated. certain children may be more likely to have a vte, such as those with cancer or other serious conditions that require hospitalization. vte may be treated or prevented with a type of medicine called an \u201canticoagulant\u201d, also known as a \u201cblood thinner\u201d. one anticoagulant that is used is called dalteparin. it is given as an injection under the skin. dalteparin has been approved for use in adults with vte in the united states and europe, but has not been approved in children because additional studies are needed to find out if dalteparin could be a useful medicine for children. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use of dalteparin in children with or without cancer, and to help determine the appropriate dose of dalteparin for treating vte in children. the study doctors collected blood samples from the children and did a blood test to find out what the \u201canti-xa level\u201d was after certain doses of dalteparin were given. the anti-xa level shows how well dalteparin makes blood clots go away or stops a blood clot from forming. specifically, the study doctors wanted to answer these questions: \uf0b7 what effect would dalteparin, given at different doses, have on the bodies of children, including children with cancer and children without cancer? \uf0b7 what would be the average dalteparin dose required to treat vte in children, based on age and weight? \uf0b7 how long did it take the children\u2019s anti-xa test results to reach target levels? ", "what happened during the study?": " this study was done to learn more about the use of dalteparin in children who have a type of cancer. first, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit for the study. this was called \u201cscreening\u201d. the children were grouped by age: \uf0b7 group 1 (1 child): 0 weeks old to less than 8 weeks old \uf0b7 group 2 (2 children): at least 8 weeks old, but less than 2 years old \uf0b7 group 3 (8 children): at least 2 years old, but less than 8 years old \uf0b7 group 4 (7 children): at least 8 years old, but less than 12 years old \uf0b7 group 5 (20 children): at least 12 years old, but less than 19 years old this was an \u201copen label\u201d study, which means that the children, their parents/guardians, and the study doctors knew which medicine the children received during the study. in this study, all children received dalteparin. there were 3 phases to this study. phase 1 was known as the \u201cdose adjustment phase\u201d. this phase started when the child received their first (starting) dose of study medicine and continued for up to 7 days. the starting dose depended on the age and weight of the child, as follows: \uf0b7 group 1: 125 iu per kilogram (kg) of weight \uf0b7 group 2: 150 iu per kg of weight \uf0b7 group 3: 125 iu per kg of weight \uf0b7 group 4: 125 iu per kg of weight \uf0b7 group 5: 100 iu per kg of weight then, during this 7-day \u201cdose adjustment phase\u201d, the study doctors tested the child\u2019s anti-xa levels. each child\u2019s dalteparin dose was adjusted (upward or downward), as needed, until the child\u2019s anti-xa test result was between 0.5 and 1.0 (the \u201ctarget\u201d range). the dose that put the child\u2019s anti-xa level into that target range is called the \u201cmaintenance dose\u201d. this is the dose that would be used going forward, in order to keep the child\u2019s anti-xa level within the target range. study. phase 2 was known as the \u201cpharmacodynamics phase\u201d, and it lasted between 1 and 7 days (enough time to collect 2 blood samples from each child). during this time, children received their maintenance dose from phase 1, given every 12 hours. after they completed phase 2, the children entered phase 3 of the study. phase 3 was known as the \u201cfollow-up phase\u201d, and it lasted until the end of the study. the children continued receiving their maintenance dose of dalteparin, given every 12 hours. the study doctors tested the children\u2019s blood to make sure anti-xa was still within the target range (0.5 to 1.0). the figure below shows what happened during this study. while children were only in the study for up to 90 days, the entire study took almost 9 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in norway, russia, slovenia, spain, and the united states. it began 20 august 2009 and finished 20 march 2018. a total of 14 girls and 24 boys participated all children were between the ages of 0 and 18 years old. the study required the children to come to a total of 7 visits at the study center. of the 38 children who were treated in the study, 26 children (68%) completed all of the study visits. at total of 12 children (32%) did not finish the study, either due to medical problems or by their parent/guardian\u2019s choice. when the study ended in march 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " what effect did dalteparin, given at different doses, have on the bodies of children, including children with cancer and children without cancer? to answer this question, the researchers looked at the children\u2019s anti-xa levels. most of the children in this study were able to reach target anti-xa levels. however, the younger children needed a higher dose of dalteparin to reach these levels, compared to the older children. for instance, children from group 2 needed an average dose of 207.5 iu per kg of weight, while children from group 4 needed an average dose of 116.7 iu per kg of weight. what was the average dose of dalteparin required to treat vte in children, based on age and weight? to answer this question, the researchers looked for the average dose of dalteparin needed to reach anti-xa target levels in each age group. the average doses needed were as follows: \uf0b7 group 2: 207.5 iu per kg of weight \uf0b7 group 3: 128.15 iu per kg of weight \uf0b7 group 4: 125 iu per kg of weight \uf0b7 group 5: 116.7 iu per kg of weight there was only 1 child in group 1, and this child did not reach the anti-xa target level during the study. therefore, the researchers were not able to determine the average how long did it take the children\u2019s anti-xa test results to reach target levels? to answer this question, the researchers measured how long it took for the children\u2019s anti-xa tests results to reach levels between 0.5 and 1.0, which was the target range. on average, it took 2.6 days for the children\u2019s anti-xa tests results to reach this range. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. if any new medical problems arose during the study, these were reported by the study doctors. in addition, if a preexisting medical problem worsened, these would also be reported. out of 38 children in this study, 33 children (87%) had at least 1 medical problem. the most common medical problems are listed below.   ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. out of 38 children in this study, 21 children (55%) had new serious medical problems that were diagnosed during the study. one child passed away during the study. the study doctor determined that this child passed away due to a condition that was present before the study started and not related to taking dalteparin.
