{"why was this study done?": " what is covid-19? in december 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) was identified as a new, potentially fatal, respiratory infection caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2). the world health organization (who) declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern on 20 january 2020 and further characterized the disease outbreak as a pandemic on 11 march 2020. sars-cov-2 needs a main protease enzyme also known as 3cl protease to replicate or reproduce. an enzyme is a protein molecule in cells which works as a biological promoter to facilitate biological reactions. enzymes speed up chemical reactions in the body, but do not get used up in the process. therefore, enzymes can be used over and over again. if the activity of this main enzyme is inhibited or stopped, the sars-cov-2 virus stops replicating. medications known as 3cl inhibitors can be used as treatments for sars-cov-2 infections. what is nirmatrelvir? nirmatrelvir (also known as pf-07321332) is an effective and selective inhibitor of the sars-cov-2 main enzyme. nirmatrelvir has shown that it has the potential to be used as a treatment for sars-cov-2 infections. when taken together with a low dose of ritonavir, the level of nirmatrelvir in the body is increased by slowing down the breakdown of nirmatrelvir. this helps the nirmatrelvir to remain active in the body for longer periods of time to help combat the virus. ritonavir is not used to treat the sars-cov-2 virus by itself as it is unlikely to be effective against the virus. in this study, nirmatrelvir was enhanced with ritonavir. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this study was to compare the level of nirmatrelvir seen in the blood of participants with moderate abnormal liver function with the level of nirmatrelvir seen in the blood of healthy participants with normal liver function after both groups had taken nirmatrelvir enhanced with ritonavir. researchers wanted to know: \uf0b7 how did the amount of nirmatrelvir in the blood compare between participants with moderate abnormal liver function and healthy participants with normal liver function after taking nirmatrelvir enhanced with ritonavir? \uf0b7 what medical problems did participants have during the study? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? researchers tested giving nirmatrelvir enhanced with ritonavir to adult participants with moderate abnormal liver function and to healthy adult participants with normal liver function to learn how differences in liver function affected the levels of nirmatrelvir in the blood. all participants stayed at the study center for 3 nights. on the first night, participants were given ritonavir. the next morning (12 hours after receiving ritonavir), participants were given nirmatrelvir together with ritonavir after a \u201cfast\u201d (period of no eating) of at least 6 hours. participants received 2 additional doses of ritonavir, 12 and 24 hours after taking nirmatrelvir together with ritonavir. researchers took samples of blood from participants during the study and measured the amount of nirmatrelvir. researchers also checked the participants\u2019 health during the study and asked them how they were feeling. participants received a telephone call between 28 and 35 days after receiving nirmatrelvir to check on their health. researchers compared the levels of nirmatrelvir in the blood of participants with moderate abnormal liver function and in the blood of healthy participants with normal liver function. the participants and researchers knew who was in each group. this is known as a \u201copen-label\u201d study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 2 locations in the united states. when did this study take place? it began 31 august 2021 and ended 07 december 2021. who participated in this study? the study included adult participants with moderate abnormal liver function and healthy adult participants with normal liver function. \uf0b7 a total of 14 men participated (7 participants with moderate abnormal liver function, 7 healthy participants with normal liver function) \uf0b7 a total of 2 women participated (1 participant with moderate abnormal liver function, 1 healthy participant with normal liver function) \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 42 and 67 years of the 16 participants who received nirmatrelvir, 16 finished the treatment and follow-up phases of the study. no participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for up to 9 weeks. the entire study took almost 14 weeks to complete. when the study ended in december 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " how did the amount of nirmatrelvir in the blood compare between participants with moderate abnormal liver function and healthy participants with normal liver function after taking nirmatrelvir enhanced with ritonavir? what was the highest amount of nirmatrelvir in the blood after participants were given nirmatrelvir enhanced with ritonavir? \uf0b7 the highest amount of nirmatrelvir in the blood after participants took nirmatrelvir enhanced with ritonavir (known as c ) was 1.9 \u00b5g/ml for both max healthy participants with normal liver function and participants with moderate abnormal liver function (see figure below). the amount of drug in the blood was measured in micrograms per milliliter, also called \u00b5g/ml. what was the estimated total amount of nirmatrelvir in the blood of participants from when nirmatrelvir was taken until nirmatrelvir was removed from the body? \uf0b7 the estimated total amount of nirmatrelvir in the blood from when nirmatrelvir was taken until nirmatrelvir was removed from the body (known as auc ) is measured in microgram hours per milliliter, also called inf \u00b5g\u2022hr/ml. the \u00b5g\u2022hr/ml is a unit used to measure total amount of drug over time in the blood. the auc was 15.2 \u00b5g\u2022hr/ml for healthy inf participants with normal liver function and 15.1 \u00b5g\u2022hr/ml for participants with moderate abnormal liver function (see figure below). researchers considered the differences in the results as minor. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. this is a summary of just some of the main results of this study. other studies may have different results. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an unknown underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. in this study, 3 out of 8 (38%) healthy participants with normal liver function and 4 out of 8 (50%) participants with moderate abnormal liver function had at least 1 medical problem. no participants left the study because of medical problems. medical problems reported by 1 or more participant are described below. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were reported during the study. all medical problems reported by 1 or more participant are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 8 healthy participants with normal liver function taking the study medication reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 8 healthy participants with normal liver function taking the study medication who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 the 3rd column tells how many of the 8 participants with moderate abnormal liver function taking the study medication reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 8 participants with moderate abnormal liver function taking the study medication who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 0 out of the 8 (0%) healthy participants with normal liver function taking the study medication reported \u201cbad taste in mouth\u201d. a total of 2 out of the 8 (25%) participants with moderate abnormal liver function taking the study medication reported \u201cbad taste in mouth\u201d.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. no participants had serious medical problems.
