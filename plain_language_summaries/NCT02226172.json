{"why was this study done?": " what was the purpose of this study? myelofibrosis (mf) is a type of bone marrow cancer, characterized by uncontrolled production of abnormal, undifferentiated (stem cells) bone marrow cells leading to development of scar tissue in bone marrow. this can change the body\u2019s normal production of blood cells. clinical features include abnormal blood counts, enlarged spleen and/or liver, bleeding, thrombosis, and debilitating constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, fever, itchiness, bone pain, abdominal pain, and feeling \u201cfull\u201d quicker when eating. glasdegib was the medicine tested in this study . glasdegib has been developed to help reduce the proliferation and growth of abnormal bone marrow stem cells which may allow this cancer to grow. cancer stem cells are cells that self-regenerate and contribute to tumor growth. the cancer stem cells can lead to tumor resistance to treatment, and spread of the tumor (metastasis). it can also impact a patient\u2019s overall survival. this study was planned to be conducted in two parts: a \u201clead-in\u201d phase and a \u201crandomized\u201d phase. all enrolled patients participated in the \u201clead-in\u201d phase of the study only. the primary purpose of the \u2018lead -in\u2019 phase of this study was to see if glasdegib (also known as pf-04449913), 100 mg daily dose, taken by mouth, was safe and tolerated in patients with mf who had previously taken ruxolitinib. ruxolitinib is a medicine, approved for use, to treat mf. ruxolitinib is sold under the name of jakafi\u00ae or jakavi\u00ae, depending on where you live. in addition, to determine how their disease responded following 24 weeks of glasdegib study treatment, patients were evaluated to assess if their spleen volume had changed by magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or computed tomography (ct). who was eligible to take part in the study? the study included adult patients who: \uf0b7 were diagnosed with mf; \uf0b7 have previously been treated with ruxolitinib for mf, for which they had to stop due to not working well enough, or because it was causing medical problems; and \uf0b7 have symptoms of mf o symptoms could include feeling \u201cfull\u201d quicker when eating, abdominal discomfort, itchiness, night sweats, bone pain, and shortness of breath. these were just some of the main criteria patients needed to have to enter the study. there were other criteria to be in the study which are not listed here. ", "what happened during the study?": " first researchers checked to see if patients were eligible to enter the study at the screening visit. next, eligible patients were enrolled into the \u201clead in\u201d phase of the study and started the study medicine, glasdegib at the baseline visit. over the course of the glasdegib treatment patients were evaluated for safety and remained on treatment for as long as they tolerated and derived clinical benefit from the treatment as determined by their study doctor. the picture below shows what happened during the study. although the safety of glasdegib was considered acceptable in \u201clead-in\u201d phase of the study, the study did not proceed into the \u201crandomized\u201d phase because glasdegib did not appear to reduce the spleen volume. while patients were only in the study for about 8 months, the entire study took 4 years to complete. some patients were in the study for longer than 8 months because they took the medicine as long as they were having clinical benefit from the study medicine. the sponsor ran this study at 10 locations in 2 countries, in japan and the united states. it began 06 october 2014 and ended 31 october 2018. 13 men and 8 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 58 and 83 years. patients were supposed to be treated with glasdegib for at least 6 months. of the 21 patients who started the study, 4 finished the 6 months of treatment with glasdegib. 17 patients did not finish the study. 1 patient died before finishing the study due to progression of their disease. 12 patients did not finish the study because they discontinued due to a medical problem they experienced. 4 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. when the study ended in october 2018, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " was taking glasdegib safe for patients with myelofibrosis? patients were given a variety of different tests to see how safe glasdegib was. these included physical exams by doctors, ecgs (a test to see how well your heart is working), collection of information (such as medical problems the patient was experiencing during the study), vital signs, blood and urine tests, and imaging tests. see below picture for a summary of the tests ran during this study. based on the data collected from these tests, taking 100 mg of glasdegib daily per mouth was manageable for patients with mf. also, taking glasdegib for longer periods of time did not appear to increase medical problems experienced in these patients. did glasdegib help to decrease patient\u2019s spleen volume? mf causes patients to have enlarged spleens. researchers wanted to see if glasdegib could help reduce spleen volume. 5 patients did experience some reduction in spleen volume at some point in this study. however, after 24 weeks of treatment, the average spleen volume increased. 6 out of 21 patients were checked for spleen volume at the 24-week visit. there was an average increase of about 9% after taking glasdegib for 24 weeks. did glasdegib help to improve patient\u2019s overall disease symptoms? patients took surveys at each of the study visits to record what their symptoms of mf were and the severity of their symptoms. from this survey, researchers assigned them a total symptom score (tss). researchers wanted to see if patient\u2019s tss improved after taking glasdegib. researchers also wanted to see how many patient\u2019s tss\u2019 improved at least 50% after taking glasdegib at the week 24 visit. a summary of the results are shown in the below picture. after 12 weeks of treatment with glasdegib: \uf0b7 8 out of 21 patients (or 38%) had a 20% or better improvement in symptoms. \uf0b7 2 out of 21 patients (or 10%) had a 50% or better improvement in symptoms. after 24 weeks of treatment with glasdegib: \uf0b7 4 out of 21 patients (or 19%) had a 20% or better improvement in symptoms. \uf0b7 1 out of the 21 patients (or 5%) had a 50% or better improvement in symptoms. researchers concluded that based on these results that glasdegib may help improve patient\u2019s symptoms for patients with mf previously treated with ruxolitinib. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants reported during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. all patients in this study had at least 1 non-serious medical problem. a \u201cnon-serious\u201d medical problem is one that is not life-threatening, or does not cause lasting medical problems or death. a total of 12 patients (57%, or 12 out of 21 patients) left the study because of medical problems. the most commonly reported medical problems were changes in how things tasted, muscle spasms, and loss of hair. the medical problems experienced by patients did not lead to any new safety concerns for glasdegib in patients with mf who had previously taken ruxolitinib. the table below shows a list of the medical problems experienced by more than 5% of all patients (or at least 2 out of the 21 patients who participated in the study).   ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, causes lasting problems, or results in death. 5 patients (24%, or 5 out of 21 patients) had a total of 15 serious medical problems. no type of serious medical problem was experienced by more than 1 patient. 1 patient had the same serious medical problem twice (respiratory failure).
