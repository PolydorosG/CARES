{"why was this study done?": " breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths in women. in 2012, about 1.7 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer and over 522,000 women died due to the disease. some people carry changes or \u201cmutations\u201d in their dna in genes called breast cancer susceptibility (brca) genes 1 and 2, or \u201cbrca1\u201d and \u201cbrca2\u201d. brca gene mutations can be inherited by a child from one of their parents (germline). when a person\u2019s brca1 or brca2 genes contain mutations, it can cause breast cancer. researchers are looking for treatments for breast cancer patients with brca mutations that can help them have more time without their cancer getting worse. talazoparib (talzenna\u00ae) is a drug that inhibits (stops) the normal activity of certain proteins called \u201cpoly (adp-ribose) polymerases\u201d, also called \u201cparps\u201d. parps are proteins (made from genes which are part of dna) that are found in all normal and cancer cells that are involved in the repair of dna. parps are needed to repair mistakes that can happen in dna when cells divide. if the mistakes are not repaired, the cell will usually die and be replaced. cells with mistakes in their dna (like cells with brca1 and brca2 gene mutations) that do not die can become cancer cells. clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other parp inhibitors, can reduce tumor size or delay the cancer getting worse, and slow tumor growth in some cancer patients with brca1 or brca2 mutations. talazoparib is given in a capsule and is taken by mouth once daily at around the same time every day. talazoparib is now approved in the united states, the european union, and other countries for the treatment of patients with a certain type of breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumor (\u201cadvanced\u201d) or has spread to other parts of the body (\u201cmetastatic\u201d) and have an inherited brca1 or brca2 gene mutation. this study was done to see if talazoparib treatment could help patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and have inherited a brca1 or brca2 gene mutation, have more time without their cancer getting worse when compared to commonly used chemotherapies. researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of talazoparib. they monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if patients taking talazoparib had more time without their cancer getting worse compared to patients taking other commonly used chemotherapies. the study included patients who: \uf0b7 were at least 18 years old \uf0b7 had breast cancer that was advanced or had spread to other parts of the body (also called \u201cmetastatic cancer\u201d) \uf0b7 inherited the brca1 or brca2 gene mutation \uf0b7 did not have more than 3 chemotherapy treatments for their advanced cancer \uf0b7 had previously taken at least 1 of the commonly used cancer chemotherapies \uf0b7 had good organ function and adequate blood counts this trial was an open-label study. this means that both the patient and the doctor knew whether the patient received talazoparib or chemotherapy. patients joined the study at 1 of 145 locations in the us, europe (belgium, france, germany, ireland, italy, poland, spain, uk, israel, russia, and ukraine), brazil, south korea, australia, and taiwan. it began on 14 october 2013 and ended on 05 march 2021. a total of 7 men and 424 women participated in this study. all patients were between the ages of 24 and 88. patients were to be treated until their doctor determined that their cancer was getting worse, the side effects were too severe, or until they chose to stop participation in the study. all of the 431 patients who started the study had stopped treatment by the end of the study, mostly due to the patient\u2019s cancer getting worse, the patient chose to stop, or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop their assigned treatment. the sponsor reviewed the study results in september 2017, september 2019, and march 2021. the sponsor then created reports of the results collected up to those time points. this is a summary of those reports. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did taking talazoparib help patients in this study have more time without their cancer getting worse than those treated with chemotherapy? researchers measured the \u201cmedian time\u201d between starting the study and the patients\u2019 cancer getting worse, or dying of any cause. the median time was the time point where half (50%) of the patients taking talazoparib or chemotherapy had their cancer get worse, or they had passed away from any cause. for patients taking talazoparib, the median number of months patients went without their cancer getting worse was about 9 months. for patients taking chemotherapy, it was about 6 months. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the patient was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems over time, doctors may be able to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. a total of 405 out of 412 patients in this study who received at least 1 dose of study medication had at least 1 medical problem (282 out of 286 on talazoparib and 123 out of 126 on chemotherapy). most medical problems were manageable by lowering the dose of talazoparib or chemotherapy medications. the most common medical problems reported by patients in this study are listed below.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or needs hospital care. a total of 142 patients out of 412 (34%, or approximately 1 out of 3 patients) had serious medical problems (103 out of 286 on talazoparib and 39 out of 126 on chemotherapy). most of these problems were not thought to be related to the study drug. a total of 320 out of 412 patients who had received at least 1 dose of talazoparib or chemotherapy medication died during the study (220 out of 286 on talazoparib and 100 out of 126 on chemotherapy). most deaths were due to the patient\u2019s cancer getting worse. two (2) serious medical problems that occurred in patients who died (veno-occlusive liver disease in a patient receiving talazoparib and sepsis in a patient receiving chemotherapy) may have been related to study treatment. in addition, 2 patients who received talazoparib developed blood cancer (acute myeloid leukemia) after they finished participating in the study that may have been related to the study treatment. these patients also received other cancer treatments which could have helped cause their acute myeloid leukemia.  ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site. the full scientific report of this study is available online at: www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct01945775 www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu use the study identifier 2013-002716-28 www.pfizer.com/research/research_ use the protocol number c3441009 clinical_trials/trial_results please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which medicines can work and are safe for patients. clinical trials with talazoparib are ongoing and further trials are planned. again, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you helped us to do that!
