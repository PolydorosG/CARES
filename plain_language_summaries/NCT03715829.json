{"why was this study done?": " what is vitiligo? vitiligo is a chronic skin disorder that causes a patchy loss of skin color. this loss of skin color could be focused in one area of the body for some people (called \u201csegmental vitiligo\u201d) or could be located over various areas of the body for other people (called \u201cnon-segmental vitiligo\u201d). melanin is the name for a pigment that is found in the skin and is responsible for skin color. melanin is made by certain types of cells in the body called melanocytes. in people with vitiligo, the skin loses these melanocytes, resulting in the patchy loss of skin color. what are ritlecitinib and brepocitinib? ritlecitinib and brepocitinib are investigational treatments that are being studied for active, non-segmental vitiligo. an investigational treatment is one that is still being studied and is not approved for use outside of research studies. ritlecitinib and brepocitinib may block the activity of certain cells and molecules that are responsible for the loss of melanocytes in the skin. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and effects of ritlecitinib and brepocitinib in people with active, non-segmental vitiligo. researchers wanted to know: during part 1, did participants have an improvement in facial vitiligo after taking study treatment for 24 weeks? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? researchers studied different doses of ritlecitinib and placebo in a group of study participants. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study treatment. researchers also studied a dose regimen of brepocitinib in a group of study participants during an extension period. the study participants and researchers did not know who took which study treatment/dose, and who took the placebo. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. the study treatments were given as tablets. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. participants were screened by a doctor to make sure they met the requirements to join the study. this study was done in 2 parts. part 1 lasted 24 weeks, and looked at the safety and effects of different doses of ritlecitinib. participants were assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups: \uf0b7 part 1 group 1 (65 participants): ritlecitinib 200 mg for 4 weeks, followed by ritlecitinib 50 mg for 20 weeks \uf0b7 part 1 group 2 (67 participants): ritlecitinib 100 mg for 4 weeks, followed by ritlecitinib 50 mg for 20 weeks \uf0b7 part 1 group 3 (67 participants): ritlecitinib 50 mg for 24 weeks \uf0b7 part 1 group 4 (50 participants): ritlecitinib 30 mg for 24 weeks \uf0b7 part 1 group 5 (49 participants): ritlecitinib 10 mg for 24 weeks \uf0b7 part 1 group 6 (66 participants): placebo participants who completed part 1 were eligible to join part 2. this part of the study lasted 24 weeks, and looked at the safety of ritlecitinib and brepocitinib. during part 2, some participants also received treatment with ultraviolet light. participants were assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups based on how they had responded to treatment during part 1. groups 1, 2, and 6 were \u201cunblinded\u201d, which means that the study participants and researchers knew who took which study treatment/dose, and who took the placebo. groups 3, 4, and 5 were blinded: \uf0b7 part 2 group 1 (55 participants): no treatment for 4 weeks (to allow the body to clear up any effects of the study treatments given during part 1), followed by brepocitinib 60 mg for 4 weeks, followed by brepocitinib 30 mg for 16 weeks \uf0b7 part 2 group 2 (43 participants): ritlecitinib 200 mg plus ultraviolet (uv) light treatment for 4 weeks, followed by ritlecitinib 50 mg plus ultraviolet light treatment for 20 weeks \uf0b7 part 2 group 3 (187 participants): ritlecitinib 200 mg for 4 weeks, followed by ritlecitinib 50 mg for 20 weeks \uf0b7 part 2 group 4 (6 participants): ritlecitinib 50 mg for 24 weeks \uf0b7 part 2 group 5 (2 participants): ritlecitinib 30 mg for 24 weeks \uf0b7 part 2 group 6 (0 participants): no treatment (observation only for 24 weeks) participants from groups 1 to 5 entered an 8-week follow-up period after they completed part 2. participants were also expected to attend up to 19 visits at the study center. the figure below shows what happened during the study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 80 locations in 10 countries. when did this study take place? it began 26 november 2018 and ended 5 february 2021. who participated in this study? the study included men and women with active, non-segmental vitiligo. participants agreed to use contraception during the course of the study. \uf0b7 a total of 171 men (47%) participated \uf0b7 a total of 193 women (53%) participated \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 18 and 66 a total of 366 participants joined part 1, and 364 participants received study treatment. of these 364 participants, 43 (12%) left during part 1 by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. 321 participants (88%) completed this part of the study. a total of 295 participants continued on to part 2, and 293 participants received study treatment. of these 293 participants, 32 (11%) left during part 2 by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. 261 participants (89%) completed this part of the study. how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for up to 60 weeks. the entire study took a little more than 2 years to complete. when the study ended in february 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " during part 1, did participants have an improvement in facial vitiligo after taking study treatment for 24 weeks? to answer this question, the study doctors assessed vitiligo found on the face after participants completed part 1 of the study (24 weeks of treatment). on average, participants from group 1 (ritlecitinib 200 mg/50 mg), group 2 (ritlecitinib 100 mg/50 mg), and group 3 (ritlecitinib 50 mg) showed an improvement in vitiligo of the face after 24 weeks of treatment, compared with participants from the placebo group (group 6). however, on average, participants from group 4 (ritlecitinib 30 mg) showed a marginal improvement, and participants from group 5 (ritlecitinib 10 mg) did not show an improvement in vitiligo of the face after 24 weeks of treatment, compared with participants from the placebo group (group 6). based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of chance. ritlecitinib may help to improve non-segmental vitiligo. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. this is a summary of just some of the main results of this study. other studies may have different results. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the
