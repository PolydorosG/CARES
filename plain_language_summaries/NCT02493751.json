{"why was this study done?": " the kidneys are organs in the body that help get rid of waste while also controlling the amount of water in the body by producing urine. renal cell carcinoma (rcc) is a type of kidney cancer that starts in the small tubes of the kidney. it is the most common kind of kidney cancer found in adults. kidney cancer is called advanced when it has grown or spread outside of the kidney. treatment for advanced rcc may include all or some of the following: \uf0b7 surgery to remove a part of the kidney or the whole kidney \uf0b7 radiation therapy, in which beams of intense energy are used to kill cancer cells \uf0b7 treatment with chemical substances (chemotherapy) \uf0b7 treatment that uses the body\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body\u2019s own natural defense against cancer (immunotherapy/biotherapy/biologic therapy) avelumab is approved in certain countries for the treatment of some cancers and is a drug that stimulates the body\u2019s own defense system against cancer. axitinib is approved in certain countries for the treatment of advanced rcc for certain patients after one prior treatment. at the time of this study, avelumab in combination with axitinib was not approved for treatment of patients with advanced rcc. recently, avelumab in combination with axitinib has been approved in some countries as treatment for patients with advanced rcc. the purpose of this study was to find the highest dose level tested of avelumab and axitinib taken together that is considered safe enough (less than 2 dose limiting toxicities [dlts] in 6 patients) to test in advanced rcc patients in further studies. this is called the \u201cmaximum tolerated dose\u201d. researchers wanted to know: \uf0b7 what is the maximum tolerated dose level of avelumab in combination with axitinib? dose limiting toxicities, dlts, are certain medical problems caused by taking a medicine or medicines which require the patient to lower the dose they are taking or to stop taking the medicine (permanently or temporarily). dlts can be many things, and may include, for example, fever with a low count of white blood cells. ", "what happened during the study?": " the study evaluated a group of patients who did not receive any treatment for advanced rcc before joining this study, to find out what dose of avelumab was best to use in future clinical studies, when taken in combination with axitinib. three different dose strength combinations of avelumab and axitinib were planned. the highest planned dose combination of avelumab and axitinib (dl1) was found to be an acceptable dose in this study, and therefore the other 2 combinations (dl-1a and dl-1b) were not explored. avelumab was given into the vein through a small needle, and axitinib tablets were taken by mouth. the treatment groups for this \u201cdose-finding phase\u201d are shown below: \uf0b7 dl1: avelumab 10 milligrams (mg) for each kilogram (kg) of the patient\u2019s body weight, every 2 weeks + axitinib 5 mg, 2 times a day \uf0b7 dl-1a: avelumab 5 mg for each kg of body weight, every 2 weeks + axitinib 5 mg, 2 times a day (planned, but not investigated in this study) \uf0b7 dl-1b: avelumab 10 mg for each kg of body weight, every 2 weeks + axitinib 3 mg, 2 times a day (planned, but not investigated in this study) this was an \u201copen-label\u201d study, which means that the patients and the researchers knew which medicine the patients received. the figure below shows what happened during this study. there were 2 parts in the study. the first part was the \u201cdose-finding phase\u201d. in this part of the study, the highest dose level, dl1, was tested to see if it is safe to use in further studies. the second part was the \u201cdose expansion phase\u201d. in this part of the study, the dl1 dose combination was given to patients to make sure that the right dose was chosen for future studies. to understand what happens to axitinib in the body, 16 patients received axitinib tablets alone for 7 days (this was known as the \u201clead in period\u201d) prior to the combination (avelumab + axitinib). the sponsor ran this study at 14 locations in the united kingdom, the united states, and japan. it began 15 october 2015 and is ongoing. 42 men and 13 women participated. 38 patients were younger than 65 years, and 17 patients were 65 years or older. at the time of data collection, patients were in the study for almost 3 years; the study was ongoing. patients were to be treated in the dose-finding phase until dlt data from 6 patients on the highest dose of avelumab and axitinib were collected. this dose was then given in the \u201cdose-expansion phase\u201d of the study, to test the safety and effectiveness of the dose. fifty-five patients received the study medications. at the time of data collection, 20 patients were still receiving the study medications: 31% (17 out of 55) of patients were still treated with both study medications, 2% (1 out of 55) of patients were still treated with avelumab alone, and 4% (2 out of 55) of patients were still being treated with axitinib alone. thirty-five patients discontinued study medication. the main reason why patients discontinued study medication was because their advanced rcc worsened. when the data were collected in april 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " what is the observed dlt of dl1? there was 1 patient (out of 6) that had 1 medical problem that was considered a dlt. this medical problem was proteinuria, which is protein in the urine. so, since there was only a single dlt among the patients in the dose finding phase at dl1, dl1 was considered an acceptable dose. for this reason, the dose of avelumab in combination with axitinib recommended for the next study was determined to be avelumab 10 mg/kg through a needle in the vein every 2 weeks + axitinib 5 mg oral 2 times a day (dl1). this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. all 55 patients in the study had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 24% (13 out of 55) of patients stopped treatment with avelumab or axitinib because of medical problems. the most common medical problems are listed below.   ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 42% (23 out of 55) of patients had serious medical problems. 31% (5 out of 16) of patients in the dl1 group with lead-in and 46% (18 out of 39) of patients in the dl1 group had a serious medical problem. 24% (13 out of 55) of patients had serious medical problems related to study treatment as assessed by the investigator. 13 patients died during the study, of which 3 died because of a serious medical problem. of the 3 patients that died due to a medical problem, the deaths of 2 patients were related to another underlying illness.
