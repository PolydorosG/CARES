{"why was this study done?": " what is bosutinib? bosutinib is a medicine approved to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (cml). cml is a cancer that begins in cells within the bone marrow, the spongy inner portion of bones where blood cells are made. what was the purpose of this study? bosutinib is a medicine that is taken by mouth (oral) as a capsule or tablet and is then absorbed (enters the blood) and distributed throughout the body to cancer cells. the purpose of this study was to determine if the amount of bosutinib that becomes available (enters the blood\u2014known as \u201cbioavailability\u201d) when the capsule is opened and contents are mixed with applesauce or yogurt is similar to when the capsules are swallowed intact, in healthy adult participants after eating breakfast. some patients may have difficulty swallowing capsules, so the researchers wanted to determine if mixing the capsule contents with applesauce or yogurt would be an acceptable way to give bosutinib. relative bioavailability (comparison of the amount of bosutinib that becomes available when administered through different methods or conditions) is assessed through 2 parameters: (1) the total amount of bosutinib from when it is administered until it is no longer present in the body and (2) the highest amount of bosutinib in the blood. this study did not test if bosutinib helps to treat cml. researchers wanted to know: \uf0b7 how did the estimated total amount of bosutinib in the blood compare when bosutinib was taken in these ways: (1) capsule opened and medicine mixed with apple sauce, (2) capsule opened and medicine mixed with yogurt, (3) whole capsule? \uf0b7 how did the highest amount of bosutinib in the blood compare when bosutinib was taken in these ways: (1) capsule opened and medicine mixed with apple sauce, (2) capsule opened and medicine mixed with yogurt, (3) whole capsule? \uf0b7 what medical problems did participants have during the study? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? researchers tested bosutinib on 18 healthy adult participants to determine the amount of bosutinib that entered the blood when the capsule contents were mixed with applesauce or yogurt, compared to when the capsules were swallowed intact. the planned treatments for this study were: \uf0b7 treatment a: bosutinib 500 mg, capsule contents mixed with 45 milliliters (ml) applesauce (equivalent to 3 tablespoons) \uf0b7 treatment b: bosutinib 500 mg, capsule contents mixed with 45 ml yogurt \uf0b7 treatment c: bosutinib 500 mg, capsule swallowed whole (intact) each participant was to take each of these treatments once during the study (1 treatment per treatment period), after eating breakfast. this was an open-label study, which means that the participants and the researchers knew which treatments the participants received and in what order. researchers took samples of blood from participants during the study and measured the amount of bosutinib in the blood. researchers also checked the participants\u2019 health during the study and asked them how they were feeling. there was a follow-up phone call about 30 days after the last dose of bosutinib. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at a single location in belgium. when did this study take place? it began 13 august 2021 and ended 27 january 2022. who participated in this study? healthy adult participants could join this study. participants in this study did not have cml. participants were examined by a study doctor and found to be appropriate to join the study. a total of 18 participants were included in the study. \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 21 and 54 \uf0b7 of the 18 participants, 16 (89%) completed the study. two participants left the study early due to study doctor decision. how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for up to about 13 weeks. the entire study took about 5 months to complete and was completed as planned. when the study ended in january 2022, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " how does the estimated total amount of bosutinib in the blood compare when bosutinib was taken in these ways: (1) capsule opened and medicine mixed with apple sauce, (2) capsule opened and medicine mixed with yogurt, (3) whole capsule? the figure below shows the estimated total amount of bosutinib measured in the blood from when bosutinib was taken until bosutinib was removed from the body. the estimated total amount of bosutinib in the blood was measured in nanogram hours per milliliter (ng\u2022hr/ml). compared to when bosutinib was swallowed intact, the estimated total amount of bosutinib in the blood was not considered different when taken with applesauce or yogurt. on average, bosutinib total amount in blood was about 6% higher when it was mixed with applesauce than when it was swallowed intact. compared to when bosutinib was swallowed intact, the estimated total amount of bosutinib in the blood was about 2% higher on average when it was mixed with yogurt than when it was swallowed intact. how does the highest amount of bosutinib in the blood compare when bosutinib was taken in these ways: (1) capsule opened and medicine mixed with apple sauce, (2) capsule opened and medicine mixed with yogurt, (3) whole capsule? the figure below shows the highest amount of bosutinib measured in the blood. the amount of bosutinib in the blood was measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). compared to when bosutinib was swallowed intact, the highest amount of bosutinib in the blood was not considered different when taken with applesauce or yogurt. on average, the highest amount of bosutinib in the blood was about 3% lower when it was mixed with applesauce than when it was swallowed intact. compared to when bosutinib was swallowed intact, the highest amount of bosutinib in the blood was about 5% lower on average when it was mixed with yogurt than when it was swallowed intact. these results suggest that mixing the capsule contents with applesauce or yogurt did not have an effect on the amount of bosutinib that entered the blood, and would be an acceptable way to give bosutinib. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. this is a summary of just some of the main results of this study. other studies may have different results. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. for treatment a (bosutinib mixed with applesauce), 11 out of 16 (69%) participants had at least 1 medical problem. for treatment b (bosutinib mixed with yogurt), 14 out of 17 (82%) participants had at least 1 medical problem. for treatment c (bosutinib swallowed intact), 15 out of 18 (83%) participants had at least 1 medical problem. no participants left the study because of a medical problem. the table below shows the most common medical problems that happened during the study (at least 3 participants in any treatment group). below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. medical problems reported by at least 3 participants in any treatment group are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 16 participants reported each medical problem with treatment a. next to this number is the percentage of the 16 participants who reported each medical problem with treatment a. \uf0b7 the 3rd column tells how many of the 17 participants reported each medical problem with treatment b. next to this number is the percentage of the 17 participants who reported each medical problem with treatment b. \uf0b7 the 4th column tells how many of the 18 participants reported each medical problem with treatment c. next to this number is the percentage of the 18 participants who reported each medical problem with treatment c. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 7 out of 16 (44%) participants reported diarrhea with treatment a, 11 out of 17 (65%) participants reported diarrhea with treatment b, and 10 out of 18 (56%) participants reported diarrhea with treatment c.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. no participants in this study had serious medical problems, and no participants died during the study.
