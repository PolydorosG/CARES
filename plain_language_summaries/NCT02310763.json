{"why was this study done?": " duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is a disease that damages muscles, causing muscle weakness and loss of the ability to walk. dmd is most common in boys. domagrozumab is an experimental medicine studied for dmd. domagrozumab has not been approved for use outside of research studies. the main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of domagrozumab in boys with dmd. researchers wanted to answer these questions: \uf0b7 what medical problems did boys have during the study? \uf0b7 did boys who received domagrozumab have an improvement in functioning after 49 weeks of treatment, compared to boys who received placebo? a placebo looks just like the medicine, but doesn\u2019t have any medicine in it. to see if boys had an improvement in functioning, researchers used a test called the \u201c4 stair climb\u201d. they measured how long it took the boys to go up stairs and then compared the results between the boys who received domagrozumab and those who received placebo. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study compared boys taking domagrozumab or placebo. the study included boys with dmd who were able to walk, and were at least 6 but younger than 16 years old when the study began. first, boys were screened by the study doctors. certain tests were done to make sure the boys were a good fit to join the study. next, boys were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. boys were assigned to each group by chance alone. putting boys into groups by chance helps make the groups more even to compare. the study was done in 2 parts, so that each boy would receive domagrozumab during part of the study. each part lasted about 48 weeks. the boys, their parents, and the researchers did not know who took domagrozumab and who took the placebo. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. boys were assigned to each group by chance alone. group 1: 41 boys \uf0b7 part 1: domagrozumab starting at 5 milligrams per kilogram of weight (mg/kg), then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg \uf0b7 part 2: domagrozumab 40 mg/kg group 2: 39 boys \uf0b7 part 1: domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg \uf0b7 part 2: placebo group 3: 40 boys \uf0b7 part 1: placebo \uf0b7 part 2: domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg all study drugs were given as an iv infusion, which means that a needle is placed in the vein and the study drug slowly drips into the vein. when they came to study visits, boys were asked to complete questionnaires about their dmd symptoms and do tests, like the 4 stair climb test. finally, boys were asked to participate in 2 follow-up visits after they stopped study treatment. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. while boys were in the study for less than 2 years, the entire study took about 4 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 35 locations in australia, bulgaria, canada, italy, japan, poland, united kingdom, and united states. it began 24 november 2014 and ended 23 november 2018. all 120 participants were boys between the ages of 6 and 15. boys were to complete part 1 and part 2 of the study, and participate in 2 follow-up visits. of the 120 boys who entered the study and received study treatment, 65 boys (54%) completed it. 55 boys (46%) did not complete the study by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a boy to stop the study, or because the sponsor decided to stop the study early. the sponsor decided to stop the study early in november 2018, because results did not show that boys benefited from taking domagrozumab. after the study ended, the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did boys who received domagrozumab have an improvement in functioning after 49 weeks of treatment, compared to boys who received placebo? to answer this question, the researchers looked at the results of the 4 stair climb test from before boys started study treatment, and after they had received study treatment for 49 weeks. the researchers looked to see if there were differences in the test results between the boys receiving domagrozumab versus the boys receiving placebo. after 49 weeks of treatment, the change in the 4 stair climb test was about the same for boys who received domagrozumab and boys who received placebo. in other words, this study did not show that boys who received domagrozumab had an improvement in functioning, compared to boys who received placebo. the figure below shows the change in results of the 4 stair climb test over 49 weeks, for boys who received domagrozumab versus boys who received placebo. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the boys had during the study. boys could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the boy was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. during part 1, 115 out of 120 boys (96%) had at least 1 medical problem. during part 2, 103 out of 113 boys (91%) had at least 1 medical problem. during part 1, 1 boy (1%) left the study because of a medical problem. the most common medical problems during part 1 and part 2 are listed below. edical ll mmon eadache miting ver fection se, per uffy in gs nt ck ugh osebleed arrhea unny edical ll mmon fection se, per ugh eadache miting arrhea in gs fficulty unny ver ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. during part 1, 2 out of 120 boys (2%) had serious medical problems. during part 2, 3 out of 113 boys (3%) had serious medical problems. all boys who had serious medical problems received domagrozumab during the study. no boys died during this study. during the extension study that followed this study, 1 boy passed away for a reason not related to taking domagrozumab. the serious medical problems during part 1 and part 2 are listed below. ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your son\u2019s study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your son\u2019s study site. the full scientific report of this study is available online at: www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct02310763 www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu use the study identifier 2016-001615-21 the results reported here might differ from additional studies that may be conducted with the same medicine in the future. no additional studies with domagrozumab are currently planned. again, thank you for assisting with this research. the commitment and expertise provided by the duchenne muscular dystrophy community were invaluable contributions to the clinical study. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you and your son helped us to do that!
