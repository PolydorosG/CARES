{"why was this study done?": " what is non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with liver fibrosis? non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) with liver fibrosis is a medical condition where there is a high amount of fat in the liver. inflammation (swelling) and fibrosis (scarring) may also be present, which can cause a stiff liver. if someone develops a stiff liver, then their liver is not able to work properly, and this may make them ill. what are danuglipron and ervogastat? danuglipron (dah-noog-lih-pron, pf-06882961) is an investigational medicine. it is not approved for use by the health authorities. danuglipron is taken by mouth. it stimulates the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and may help to lower blood sugar levels by increasing insulin secretion. danuglipron may also increase the feeling of fullness and may lower food intake. ervogastat (err-vo-ga-stat, pf-06865571) is a new investigational medicine. it is not approved for use by health authorities. ervogastat is taken by mouth. it blocks a specific enzyme (protein) called \u201cdgat2\u201d. this prevents the body from making certain types of fats. too much fat in the liver is the first step toward developing nash and liver scarring. ervogastat decreases the storage of fat in the liver, which may help treat nash with liver scarring. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this study was to compare the levels of danuglipron and ervogastat in participants\u2019 blood. the study drugs were given alone or as a combination, which means they were taken at the same time. the researchers did this because they wanted to see how the study drugs interact with one another. researchers wanted to know: \uf0b7 how does the amount of danuglipron or ervogastat in the blood change when these drugs are taken individually compared to when danuglipron and ervogastat are taken together? \uf0b7 what medical problems did participants have during the study? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? there were 2 parts in this study, part a and part b. in part a, researchers tested 20 mg danuglipron with or without 300 mg ervogastat in a group of healthy adult participants. they did this to learn how the amount of danuglipron in the blood changed when taken with or without ervogastat. there were 2 study periods (periods 1 and 2) in this part of the study. figure 1a shows when participants were to take single doses of 20 mg danuglipron and 300 mg ervogastat. figure 1a: part a study plan in part b, researchers tested different doses of danuglipron and ervogastat. they did this in a group of healthy adults who were overweight or with obesity. the researchers wanted to learn how the amount of ervogastat in the blood changed when taken with danuglipron. they also wanted to see if the amount of danuglipron in the blood changed when taken with ervogastat. in part b, there were 4 study periods (periods 1 to 4). participants were to take a different treatment during each study period (figure 1b). in period 1, participants took 1 dose of 300 mg ervogastat on day 1. in period 2, participants took 10 mg danuglipron twice a day. from days 3 to 46, this was titrated up to 200 mg twice a day. titrated means to increase the dose of a drug slowly. in period 3, participants took 1 dose of 300 mg ervogastat on day 47. they also took up to 200 mg danuglipron twice a day on days 47 and 48. in period 4, participants took 300 mg ervogastat twice a day from days 49 to 61. they also took up to 200 mg danuglipron twice a day from days 49 to 61. figure 1b: part b study plan during the study, researchers took samples of blood from participants. they measured the amount of danuglipron and ervogastat in the samples. they also checked the participants\u2019 health during the study and asked them how they were feeling. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 1 study site in the united states. when did this study take place? it began 05 april 2021 and ended 08 november 2021. who participated in this study? part a included healthy adult participants. part b included healthy adults who were overweight or with obesity. in part a: \uf0b7 a total of 6 men participated \uf0b7 a total of 2 women participated \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 20 and 57 years in part b: \uf0b7 a total of 18 men participated \uf0b7 a total of 1 woman participated \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 30 and 64 years in part a, all 8 participants finished the treatment and the follow-up period. in part b, of the 19 participants who started treatment, 3 did not finish the treatment. two (2) of these stopped treatment because of medical problems (they developed coronavirus disease 2019 [covid-19]) and 1 participant left by choice. how long did the study last? in part a, participants were in the study for about 9 weeks. in part b, participants were in the study for about 18 weeks. the entire study took just over 7 months to complete. when the study ended in november 2021 the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.
