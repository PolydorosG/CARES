{"why was this study done?": " candida is a type of fungus that is normally found in small amounts in the human body. sometimes, too much candida can grow in the body and cause health problems. this is known as a candida infection. the name \u201cinvasive candida infection\u201d is used when the infection has spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream. certain medicines or diseases, like cancer, may make a child more likely to develop an invasive candida infection. anidulafungin is a medicine that is currently used to treat candida infections in adults. this study was designed to learn more about using anidulafungin to treat candida infections in children. anidulafungin has not been approved for use in children, as it is still being studied. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety of anidulafungin in children with invasive candida infection. the researchers wanted to answer this question: \uf0b7 did the children in this study have any new or worsening medical problems? if so, what new or worsening medical problems did the children have? the researchers also wanted to learn more about how anidulafungin works to treat invasive candida infection in children. the researchers wanted to answer this question: \uf0b7 how many children were cured or had an improvement in candida infection? ", "what happened during the study?": " this study was for children who were diagnosed with invasive candida infection, or who were at high risk for getting an invasive candida infection. the children in this study were at least 1 month old, but younger than 18 years old when the study started. first, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit for the study. this was called \u201cscreening\u201d. the children were grouped by age: \uf0b7 group 1 (19 children): at least 1 month old, but younger than 2 years old \uf0b7 group 2 (19 children): at least 2 years old, but younger than 5 years old \uf0b7 group 3 (30 children): at least 5 years old, but younger than 18 years old all the children in this study were given anidulafungin by iv (a needle in the vein), and the doses were based on each child\u2019s weight. on the first day of treatment, children were given 3 milligrams (mg) of anidulafungin per kilogram (kg) of weight. from the second day of treatment onwards, children were given 1.5 mg of anidulafungin per kg of weight. children were supposed to receive anidulafungin for at least 10 days if they had a candida infection and at least 5 days if they were at high risk of getting a candida infection. after the anidulafungin treatment, the study doctor may have decided to switch some of the children to another antifungal medicine called fluconazole, given by mouth, to continue treatment of the candida infection. all children could receive up to 35 days of anidulafungin and up to 49 days of total treatment (anidulafungin + fluconazole). this was an \u201copen-label\u201d study, which means that the researchers, the children, and the children\u2019s parents/caregivers knew which medicines were being given. safety was carefully considered throughout the study. the study doctors examined each child, did blood/urine tests, and watched for any medical problems. the study doctors also followed up with the children for 6 weeks after their last dose of study treatment. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. while children were only in the study for up to 13 weeks (treatment plus follow-up), the entire study took about 9 years to complete. children joined the study at 1 of 26 locations in 10 countries (brazil, canada, greece, italy, republic of korea, russia, spain, taiwan, united kingdom, and united states). the first child joined the study on 27 february 2009 and the last child finished the study on 14 february 2018. a total of 30 girls and 38 boys joined the study. patients were supposed to receive study treatment for up to 35 days and come to 2 follow-up visits at week 2 and week 6 of the study. of the 68 children who started the study, 58 children (85%) completed it. ten (10) children (15%) did not finish the study by their choice or because they passed away. the study doctors determined that none of these deaths were related to the study treatment. when the study ended in february 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " how many children were cured or had an improvement in candida infection? for the 64 patients who had a candida infection in this study, study doctors examined how well the study treatment worked on the last day the child received study treatment (anidulafungin alone and anidulafungin + fluconazole) and at the follow-up visits. on the last day that all study treatment was received, candida infection was either cured or improving in 46 (72%) children. at the last follow-up visit, candida infection was cured in 43 (67%) children. the percentage of children who were cured in this study was similar to the percentage of cured patients in previous adult studies with anidulafungin. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the children had during the study. children could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the child was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. out of 68 children in this study, 66 children (97%) had at least 1 medical problem. the most common medical problems reported in children in this study are listed below.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. out of 68 children in this study, 30 children (44%) had a serious medical problem. for 3 children, study doctors determined that 1 medical problem for each child (diarrhea, bleeding of the stomach/intestines, high liver enzyme tests that may indicate liver damage) may have been related to the study treatment. eight (8) children (12%) passed away during the study. the study doctors determined that none of these deaths (0%) were related to the study treatment. overall, the medical problems reported in this study were similar to the medical problems reported in past studies with adults and are in line with medical problems expected in children with candida infection. no new issues related to the safety of the study treatment were found. ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your child\u2019s study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your child\u2019s study site. the full scientific report of this study is available online at: www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct00761267 www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu use the study identifier 2008-004150-32 please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which medicines can work and are safe for patients. no additional studies with anidulafungin are planned. again, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you helped us to do that!
