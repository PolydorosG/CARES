{"why was this study done?": " heart disease is a leading cause of death in both men and women. one of the biggest risks for getting heart disease is having high \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol (called ldl, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). having high ldl cholesterol can lead to heart disease. doctors prescribe medicines called \u201cstatins\u201d to patients with high ldl cholesterol to lower the ldl cholesterol in the blood. for some people, statins may not lower cholesterol enough. researchers did this study to look for a new way to treat patients who are taking a statin and who still have ldl cholesterol above what their doctors consider ideal. bococizumab was the medicine tested in this study. it is not a statin. bococizumab is a medicine that is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) which may help to lower ldl cholesterol. in most studies with bococizumab, patients had to use a pre-filled syringe to inject the medicine. the sponsor developed a more automated way of giving an injection using a device called a pre-filled pen (autoinjector). for this study, researchers wanted to test the pre-filled pen as a new way to give this medicine. for this study, researchers wanted to know: \uf0b7 does bococizumab help to lower ldl cholesterol in patients who are taking a statin and who still have ldl cholesterol above ideal levels? \uf0b7 how well can patients (or a helper) use a pre-filled pen to inject bococizumab? ", "what happened during the study?": " this study was done to see if patients taking bococizumab had lower levels of ldl cholesterol compared to patients taking a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. all groups used the pre-filled pen to give the medicine. this was done to find out how well the patients (or a helper) could use the pre-filled pen. this study included adult men and women who: \uf0b7 had high cholesterol because of: o a genetic (passed down from birth) reason (called \u201cprimary hyperlipidemia\u201d), o a genetic reason and/or because of lifestyle factors, like the foods you eat or how much you exercise (called \u201cmixed dyslipidemia\u201d) \uf0b7 were taking a statin medication but still had high levels of cholesterol patients were put into 1 of 4 groups by chance with twice as many patients being given the medicine than the placebo. this is known as a \u201crandomized\u201d study. this is done to make the groups more similar for things like age, and the number of men and women. making the groups similar makes comparing the groups more fair. the patients and researchers did not know who received which medicine during the study. this is known as a \u201cdouble-blinded\u201d study. researchers use \u201cdouble-blinded\u201d studies to make sure that the results of the study are not influenced in any way. for 4 weeks, patients were checked (screened) to make sure they met all the requirements of the study. next, patients were put into 1 of 4 groups and were treated for 12 weeks. after completing the 12 weeks of treatment, patients were followed by researchers for 6 weeks (follow-up phase) to see how they did after taking the study medicines. while patients were only in the study for 5 months, the entire study took 8 months to complete because it took about 3 months for all the patients to enter the study. the study took place at 28 clinical sites in the united states. it began on 09 june 2015 and ended on 03 february 2016. 299 patients were treated in this study. 162 were men and 137 were women. all patients were between the ages of 19 and 84 years old. patients were supposed to be treated for 12 weeks and then followed for about 6 more weeks. of the 299 patients who started the study, 289 patients finished the study. 10 patients decided not to finish the study or a study doctor decided it was best for the patient to stop the study. when the study ended in february 2016, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did bococizumab help to lower ldl cholesterol in patients who are taking a statin and who have ldl cholesterol above ideal levels? yes, bococizumab worked better than placebo to further lower ldl cholesterol. researchers looked at the average change in all patients\u2019 ldl cholesterol from the start of the study compared to all patients\u2019 average ldl cholesterol after 12 weeks of taking the study medicines. on average, patients who took bococizumab 150 mg had their ldl cholesterol drop by about 57% from their starting value. the patients taking bococizumab 150 mg placebo had their ldl cholesterol go up about 6% from their starting value. based on these results and the number of patients, the researchers have concluded that the results are not likely the result of chance. how well can patients (or a helper) use the pre-filled pen? patients who took bococizumab 150 mg used the pre-filled pen the right way at least 93% of the time (93 of every 100 times) on each occasion they were meant to inject (from weeks 0 to 10) during the study. they were successful 98% of the time (98 of every 100 times) for the last injection at week 10. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results, and individual results could be better or worse than the overall group. other studies may find different results. these are just some of the main findings of the study. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could have been caused by a study treatment, or by another drug the patient was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. 1 patient left the study due to medical problems. 21 out of 299 patients in this study had at least 1 non-serious medical problem. the most common are listed below. ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, causes lasting problems, or needs hospital care. 7 patients (2%, or 2 out of 100 patients) had serious medical problems. no patients died during the study. 4 patients in the bococizumab groups, and 3 patients in the placebo groups had a serious medical problem. all serious medical problems were considered by the doctors and sponsor as not due to study medicines. ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site. for more details on this study protocol, please visit online at www.clinicaltrials.gov (use the study identifier nct02458287). please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which medicines work best and are safest for patients. no further clinical trials with bococizumab are planned at this time. again, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you helped us to do that!
