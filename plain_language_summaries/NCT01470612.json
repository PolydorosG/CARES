{"why was this study done?": " what is ulcerative colitis? ulcerative colitis (\u201cuc\u201d) is a long-term inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. uc affects the mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. patients with uc experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as flares. flares are characterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and presence of blood in the stools, as well as sense of urgency. flares are followed by periods of remission (time with no symptoms) that vary in length from weeks to years. there is no known cure for uc. treatment can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of uc and can even lead to long-term remission. however, there are few treatment options for patients with moderately to severely active uc. medication is the most common treatment for uc. what is tofacitinib? tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. it is an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been approved, and is available by prescription, to treat adults with active, moderate to severe uc that did not respond well to other medications. what was the purpose of this study? researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of tofacitinib in participants with uc when taken over a long period of time. researchers wanted to know: how many participants had medical problems during this study? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. participants who were a good fit were assigned to receive either tofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) or tofacitinib 10 mg twice per day by mouth, depending on whether they had uc symptoms when this study started. participants with no symptoms (known as being \u201cin remission\u201d) received tofacitinib 5 mg, and participants with symptoms received tofacitinib 10 mg. the dose could be adjusted during the study, if needed. this was an \u201copen-label\u201d study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose they received. participants were expected to attend visits at the study center every 3 months, and complete a 4-week follow-up period after they finished study treatment. the figure below shows what happened during this study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 298 locations in 31 countries in africa, asia, australia/new zealand, europe, north america, and south america. when did this study take place? it began on 1 october 2012 and ended on 6 august 2020. who participated in this study? this study included adult men and women who: \uf0b7 had moderate to severe uc \uf0b7 had participated in a previous study with tofacitinib \uf0b7 had not had surgery for uc and were not likely to need surgery for uc during the study \uf0b7 did not have other bowel diseases, such as crohn\u2019s disease, infectious colitis, or colon cancer \uf0b7 a total of 555 men participated \uf0b7 a total of 389 women participated \uf0b7 all participants were between the ages of 18 and 81 participants could continue taking study treatment as long as they continued to benefit from it, or until the study ended. of the 944 participants who started the study and received treatment, 195 completed it. a total of 749 participants stopped taking study treatment early \uf0b7 by their choice, \uf0b7 because they did not see significant improvement in uc symptoms, \uf0b7 because they had a medical problem, \uf0b7 because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study, \uf0b7 because they switched to a different study, \uf0b7 or because tofacitinib became available by prescription in their country (japan) how long did the study last? the amount of time that each participant was in this study varied. the entire study took almost 8 years to complete. when the study ended in august 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. what medical problems did participants have during the study? the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. 780 out of 944 (83%) participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem. \uf0b7 154 out of 175 (88%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg had a medical problem. \uf0b7 626 out of 769 (81%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg had a medical problem. a total of 196 out of 944 (21%) participants left the study because of medical problems. \uf0b7 30 out of 175 (17%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg left the study because of a medical problem. \uf0b7 166 out of 769 (22%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg left the study because of a medical problem. the most common medical problems \u2013 those reported by at least 10% of participants \u2013 are described below. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all medical problems reported by at least 10% of participants are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 175 participants taking tofacitinib 5 mg reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 175 participants taking tofacitinib 5 mg who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 the 3rd column tells how many of the 769 participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 769 participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg who reported the medical problem. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 41 out of the 175 (23%) participants taking tofacitinib reported a common cold. a total of 157 out of 769 (20%) participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg reported common cold. did study participants have any serious medical problems? a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 186 out of 944 (20%) participants in this study had at least 1 serious medical problem. \uf0b7 38 out of 175 (22%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg had serious medical problems \uf0b7 148 out of 769 (19%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg had serious medical problems a total of 6 participants in the tofacitinib 10 mg group died during or following study treatment. the most common serious medical problems \u2013 those reported by at least 2% of participants \u2013 are described below. where can i learn more about this study?
