{"why was this study done?": " what is prostate cancer? prostate cancer is a common cancer in men that occurs in the prostate. the prostate is a small walnut-sized gland located beneath the bladder. prostate cancer is the most common cancer in american men (except for skin cancers). prostate cancer may cause no signs or symptoms in its early stages and if detected early, when it's still confined to the prostate gland, has the best chance for successful treatment. however, when it has spread to other parts of the patient\u2019s body (known as metastatic cancer), the chance of survival decreases. most prostate cancer cells need androgens (male sex hormones) to grow. treatments that target hormones decrease the androgen levels or block them thereby decreasing the prostate cancer cells\u2019 growth. treatments for prostate cancer includes: \uf0b7 surgically removing the cancer or testicles (surgical castration) \uf0b7 radiotherapy \uf0b7 androgen-deprivation therapy to decrease the androgen levels, also known as chemical castration \uf0b7 anti-androgen medications to stop androgens from working inside the prostate cancer cells what is pf-06753512? immunotherapy is a type of cancer therapy that helps the body\u2019s immune system fight cancer. there are 2 types of immunotherapies that are currently available for men with advanced prostate cancer: vaccines and medications. pf-06753512 or prostate cancer vaccine-based immunotherapy regimen (vbir) combines a two-part immunotherapy vaccine (pf-06755992 or adenovirus c68) and plasmid dna [pdna (pf-06755990)] with injections of an immunotherapy medication (tremelimumab alone or with pf-06801591) to activate the immune system\u2019s ability to fight the prostate cancer cells. pf-06755992 is an adenovirus vaccine which uses 3 antigens that are specific for prostate cancer. these antigens are prostate specific antigen (psa), prostate specific membrane antigen (psma) and prostate stem cell antigen (psca). a vaccination boost called pdna or pf-06755990 delivers the psa, psma and psca antigens to the immune system. the pdna boost was administered using a device called the intramuscular trigrid delivery system (tds-im). the tds-im device \u201copened the pathway\u201d into the cells, which allowed the pdna to get into the cell. tremelimumab is a monoclonal antibody which is a laboratory-made protein that mimics or boosts the immune system's ability to fight off harmful pathogens. the immunotherapy vaccines teach the immune system what cancer cells look like so the immune system can find and kill them. the immunotherapy medications are known as checkpoint inhibitors. cancer cells sometimes use molecules on cells called immune checkpoints to avoid attack by the immune system. checkpoint inhibitors block these molecules so the immune system can find and kill the cancer cells. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this research study was to learn about the safety and effects of vbir, and when vbir is given together with pf-06801591 in participants whose disease progressed after treatment with hormone medications such as abiraterone or enzalutamide (medications that are approved for the treatment of advanced or metastatic prostate cancer). researchers also wanted to determine if vbir and its combination with pf-06801591 has manageable side effects and provides long-term cancer control in men with prostate cancer. a \"side effect\" is something (expected or unexpected) that you feel was caused by a medicine or treatment you take. researchers wanted to know: \uf0b7 what side effects did participants have during the study? \uf0b7 was the vbir safe in combination with pf-06801591 and did the participants tolerate it? \uf0b7 were there any dose-limiting toxicities (dlts) \uf0b7 what doses from part a of the study should be used in part b of the study (see figure 1)? ", "what happened during the study?": " how was the study done? figure 1 below shows part a \u2013 dose escalation and part b \u2013 dose expansion. researchers tested increasing doses and combinations of vbir components (pf-06755992, pdna, tremelimumab) and pf-06801591 on participants to learn how the vbir and pf-06801591 acted in the body. the cohorts (grouping) and dosing of the vbir and pf-06801591 for the participants is shown. participants were divided into groups to test the safety of vbir and pf-06801591: group 1: participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mcrpc) who had not taken anti-androgens or had cancer that did not respond to anti-androgens. mcrpc is an advanced form of prostate cancer that does not respond to other treatments and has spread to other parts of the body. group 2: participants with non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (hspc) who had a biochemical relapse (rising psa levels) before receiving androgen-deprivation therapy. figure 1. overall study design where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 10-12 different research locations in the united states (us). when did this study take place? it began 30 december 2015 and ended 23 february 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who met the inclusion criteria such as men over the age of 18 years, a diagnosis of prostate cancer, and those without any serious liver, adequate bone marrow or kidney problems. a total of 91 men participated. all participants were between the ages of 52 and 88 years. of the 91 participants who started the study, 44 finished the study and 47 participants were discontinued from the study. the main reason for discontinuation from the study phase was the participants refused further follow\u2011up. een participants left before the study was over by their own choice, their cancer got worse, or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for about 14 months (depended on the participants cohort). the entire study took around 5 years to complete. the study was terminated on 20 august 2020 by the sponsor. the decision to terminate this study was based on a business decision and was not because of any safety or regulatory concerns with vbir and pf-06801591. when the study ended in february 2021 (last participant last visit), the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " results from this study suggest that the vbir and pf 06801591 had manageable side effects in participants (table 1). ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " comparing understand ninety out of 91 (99%) participants in this study had at least 1 side effect. a total of 27 participants discontinued the study treatment because of side effects. the most common side effects \u2013 those reported by at least 20% of participants \u2013 are described below. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 1 lists side effects that were commonly reported during the study. all side effects reported in at least 20% of participants are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 91 participants being administered the vbir and pf-06801591 reported each side effect. next to this number is the percentage of the 91 participants being administered the vbir and pf-06801591 who reported the side effect. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 35 out of the 91 participants (38%) being administered the vbir and pf-06801591 reported joint pain. did study participants have any dose-limiting toxicities? a dlt is a clinically significant side effect that occurs during a specific period after starting study treatment within the study (in the first 28 days after starting study treatment) and the side effects are graded based on a pre-defined grading scale. in part a of the study, 1 participant (1%) experienced a dlt in the first 28 days after treatment with the vaccine, pf-06755992. the participant experienced a serious side effect of myositis (inflammation of the muscles that are used to move the body) and myasthenia gravis (a chronic autoimmune disorder in which antibodies destroy the communication between nerves and muscle, resulting in muscle weakness). both the side effects were because of administration of the vbir and resulted in the participant permanently stopping the administration of the vbir. ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a side effect is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. below are instructions on how to read table 2. instructions for understanding table 2. \uf0b7 the 1st column of table 2 lists serious side effects that were reported during the study. all serious side effects reported by at least 5% of participants are listed. \uf0b7 the 2nd column tells how many of the 91 participants being administered the vbir and pf-06801591 reported each serious side effect. next to this number is the percentage of the 91 participants being administered the vbir and pf 06801591 who reported the serious side effect. \uf0b7 using these instructions, you can see that 4 out of the 91 participants (4%) being administered the vbir and pf 06801591 reported inflammation of the colon. six participants (7%) died during the study, of which 5 participants (5%) deaths were because of a serious side effect and in 2 of those participants (2%) deaths were considered related to the administration of the vbir. increasing doses of the vbir alone and in combination with increasing doses of pf-06801591 were well-tolerated in prostate cancer participants. based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of chance. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. this is a summary of just some of the main results of this study. other studies may have different results.
