{"why was this study done?": " breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women and there were over 2 million new cases world-wide in 2018. lots of different types of breast cancer exist, so a range of treatment options are needed. one treatment option for a specific type of advanced or \u201cmetastatic\u201d breast cancer is ibrance\u00ae (palbociclib). metastatic means that the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. ibrance (palbociclib) treatment was first approved for use in 2015. the researchers did this study so that they could offer patients with specific types of advanced breast cancer treatment with palbociclib if this treatment was not commercially approved or if patients were not eligible for clinical trials. this study ended when palbociclib became commercially available in participating countries and doctors were able to prescribe this treatment for their patients. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study provided palbociclib alongside letrozole therapy to all patients who entered the study as follows: \u2022 palbociclib 125 mg once a day for 21 days and then nothing for 7 days every 28-day cycle, and \u2022 letrozole 2.5 mg once a day throughout the study. the study provided access to palbociclib for patients who were post-menopausal women with \u201chormone receptor-positive (hr-positive)\u201d and \u201chuman epidermal growth factor-negative (her2-negative)\u201d advanced breast cancer and who lived in argentina, brazil, colombia, and mexico. hr-positive and her2-negative breast cancer means that the cancer can grow and spread if certain \u201chormones\u201d are present. hormones are chemicals produced in the body that carry messages from one area to another. if the chemical messenger comes into contact with the cancer cell, then sometimes, if the cancer is positive for that chemical messenger, the cancer will grow and spread. for patients in this study, their cancer would grow and spread if female hormones (estrogen and progesterone) were present in their blood. palbociclib is one option available to patients with hr-positive breast cancer. most patients (90%) in this study had been treated with a systemic anti-cancer therapies before they joined the study and received palbociclib. this included 35% who had been given 1 previous anti-cancer therapy, 20% who had been given 2 previous anti-cancer therapies, and 35% who had been given 3 or more previous anti-cancer therapies. while patients were in the study for an average of around 11 months, the entire study took over 4 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at sites in latin american countries (argentina, brazil, colombia, and mexico). it began 15 april 2016 and ended on 28 may 2019 and 131 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 28 and 83 years. of the 131 patients who started the study, 130 patients received treatment with palbociclib and letrozole and 1 patient left the study before being treated. the study was closed by the sponsor when palbociclib was approved by the regulatory authorities and doctors were able to prescribe this treatment for their patients. most patients left the study for this reason or because their cancer had progressed. when the study ended in may 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did taking palbociclib and letrozole help tumors disappear or shrink? researchers looked at the \u201cobjective response rate,\u201d which is whether tumors disappeared (eg, \u201ccomplete response\u201d) or shrunk (eg, \u201cpartial response\u201d) after taking palbociclib and letrozole. overall, 32 patients had a tumor that disappeared or shrunk (25%, or 32 out of the 129 patients who had data on tumor response). researchers also measured how long it took for the tumor to come back after it had disappeared and the time it took for the tumor to start to grow again after it had shrunk. to do this, the researchers took the result (in the number of months) from each patient and put them in order from the smallest to the largest. they then looked at the middle number, or the \u201cmedian\u201d, to help them answer this question. the median time to when the tumor started to come back after it had disappeared or started to grow again after it had shrunk was almost 11 months for patients taking palbociclib and letrozole. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. 129 out of 130 patients (99%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 8 patients (6%, or 8 out of 130 patients) left the study completely because of medical problems. there were also 106 patients (82%, 106 out of 130 patients) who temporarily stopped palbociclib because of medical problems and 26 patients (20%, 26 out of 130 patients) who temporarily stopped letrozole. the most common medical problems are listed in the following table. this included low numbers of neutrophils in the blood (reported as \u2018neutropenia\u2019 or \u2018neutrophil count decreased\u2019), low numbers of leukocytes in the blood, anemia where there were low numbers of red blood cells in the blood, and thrombocytopenia where there were low numbers of platelets in the blood. both neutrophils and leukocytes are a special kind of white blood cell that help the body fight an infection. red blood cells carry oxygen around the body to where it is needed. platelets are special cells in the blood that help the blood to clot after an injury. blood tests are used during chemotherapy to check the levels of the various cell types in blood as these are often reduced by treatment. in clinical studies, low numbers of white or red blood cells in the blood may be reported using different terminology that has the same meaning. for example, low numbers of neutrophils in the blood could be reported as \u2018neutropenia\u2019 or as \u2018neutrophil count decreased\u2019. low numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells, and/or platelets in the blood are usually managed by reducing the dose of the chemotherapy, temporarily stopping chemotherapy, or by giving other treatment to help the body make more of these cells. a neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, could be reported as \u201cneutropenia\u201d or \u201cneutrophil count decreased\u201d ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 32 patients (25%, or 32 out of 130 patients) had serious medical problems. researchers believed that in 7 patients (5%, or 7 out of 130 patients), the serious medical problems were due to the patient\u2019s cancer coming back or getting worse. there were 12 patients (9%, or 12 of the 130 patients) who passed away during the study: 5 patients passed away during palbociclib treatment (day 1 up to day 28 after the last dose of palbociclib) and 7 patients passed away during the follow-up period and more than 28 days after their last dose of palbociclib. the researchers did not think any of the deaths were related to palbociclib but rather most were related to the patient\u2019s breast cancer. the researchers also thought that the medical problems seen in this study were similar to the medical problems seen with palbociclib in other studies. ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site. for more details on this study protocol, please visit: www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct02600923 findings from this trial will be used to increase our understanding of how palbociclib can be used to treat patients with breast cancer. please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which medicines can work and are safe for patients. again, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you helped us to do that!
