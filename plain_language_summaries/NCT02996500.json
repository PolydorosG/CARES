{"why was this study done?": " rheumatoid arthritis, or \u201cra\u201d, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. ra is an \u201cautoimmune disease\u201d, which means that patients with ra have an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as the joints. ra can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes untreated, so researchers are looking for new treatment options for ra. patients in this study were treated with pf-06650833, which is an \u201cinvestigational drug\u201d. this means it is not approved for use in people with ra and is a new type of drug that is being studied for the treatment of ra. some of the patients in this study were also treated with tofacitinib. this is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system in people with ra. it is an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been approved, and is available by prescription, to treat adults with active, moderate to severe ra that did not respond well to medications known as disease- modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) like methotrexate. researchers did this study to see if taking pf-06650833 helped with the symptoms of ra by reducing inflammation. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study compared 6 groups of patients to find out if pf-06650833 given at 4 different doses works to treat ra compared to patients taking a \u201cplacebo\u201d or a comparator medicine of tofacitinib (see figure and table). a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. the patients and the doctors did not know who was given which treatment/medicine and at what dose in this study. this is known as a \u201cdouble-blinded\u201d study. this was done to make sure that the trial results were not influenced in any way. volunteers were assigned to each group by chance alone. this is known as a \u201crandomized study\u201d. this is done to make the groups more similar, which makes comparing the groups more fair.  a all tablets were identical in appearance. the study included adult patients with moderate to severe active ra. all the patients in this study were already taking methotrexate, but still had active ra symptoms. in addition to methotrexate, the patient could have been previously treated with an anti- tumor necrosis factor (anti-tnf). this is a particular kind of treatment that specifically \u201cinhibits\u201d the activity of chemicals in the body known as tnfs. inhibits means that activity of a chemical is slowed down, reduced, or stopped. anti-tnf treatment is used in ra to help control the disease and reduce pain and disability. the anti-tnf treatment could have been stopped because of safety concerns, if it did not seem to give sufficient help to the patient, or if the patient was not able to obtain the treatment due to access problems. in addition to study medication (pf-06650833 plus placebo or tofacitinib plus placebo), patients could take their normal treatments for ra including methotrexate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitors, some types of opioid and/or acetaminophen (paracetamol) for pain relief and/or a low dose of oral corticosteroids like prednisone. while each patient was only in the study for 20 weeks, the entire study took 21 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 103 locations in 19 countries in asia, europe, central america, north america, and oceania. it began on 10 november 2016 and ended on 15 august 2018. 59 men and 210 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 19 and 73 years. patients were to be treated for 12 weeks. of the 269 patients who started the study, 237 finished the study (e.g., 12 weeks of treatment plus 4 weeks of follow up). during the follow-up period, patients were not given treatment but were only monitored for possible safety events. there were 32 patients who left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. of these 32 patients, 27 patients did not complete the 12 weeks of treatment and 5 patients completed the 12 weeks of treatment, but did not completed the 4 weeks of follow- up. when the study ended in august 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did 12 weeks of treatment with pf-06650833 reduce ra activity? ra activity was measured using a \u201csimplified disease activity index\u201d, which gives a score for disease activity. this score is based on the number of swollen and tender joints as well as how the patient feels about their ra, what the patient\u2019s doctor thinks about the patient\u2019s ra, and the amount of a substance known as \u201cc-reactive protein\u201d, or crp, which can be found in a patient\u2019s blood. crp is made by the liver if there is an \u201cinflammatory response\u201d. an inflammatory response is the body\u2019s reaction to an infection or something the body thinks is foreign. a negative score at week 12 in the simplified disease activity index compared with \u201cbaseline\u201d, or the score the patient had just before the start of treatment in this study, means the patient and their doctor thinks that their ra activity has been reduced. after 12 weeks of treatment, ra activity was reduced in patients who took pf-06650833 compared with patients taking placebo. the average reduction in ra activity with pf-06650833 depended on the dose given, but the score was between 22 and 25 for pf-06650833 compared with a score of 14 for placebo. based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely a result of chance. note: this study was specifically set up to look at the ra activity after pf-06650833 treatment compared with placebo. therefore ra activity after tofacitinib treatment was not included in the graph below. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. 123 out of 269 patients in this study had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 12 patients (5%, 12 out of 269 patients) left the study because of medical problems. there were 20 patients (7%, 20 out of 269 patients) who stopped taking the study treatment for a short period of time or who had their dose of study treatment reduced during this study. the most common medical problems are listed below.  ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 8 patients (3%, or 8 out of 269 patients) had serious medical problems: 6 patients in the pf-06650833 groups, 1 patient in the tofacitinib group, and 1 patient in the placebo group. the doctors thought that 1 serious medical problem was related to study treatment. this was a report of serious liver injury by a patient in the pf-06650833 20 mg group. all of the other serious medical problems were reported by 1 patient each and none were thought by the doctors to be linked with study treatment. no patients died during the study.
