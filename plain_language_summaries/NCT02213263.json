{"why was this study done?": " the purpose of this research study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of pf-05280586 to currently approved and marketed rituximab for treatment of low tumor burden follicular lymphoma (also called ltb-fl). ltb-fl is a type of non- hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (nhl). nhl is a type of cancer which starts in your lymphatic system (the disease fighting system). ltb-fl is not as aggressive and has a better prognosis (the likely outcome) than other types of nhl. one of the most common treatments for ltb-fl is with a medication called rituximab (also called rituxan\u00ae or mabthera\u00ae). rituximab is given as a monotherapy for ltb-fl. monotherapy means one medicine given without other medicines at the same time. rituximab works by attaching to a protein called cd20. cd20 sits on the surface of b lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). when rituximab binds to the cd20 protein it causes the b lymphocytes, including the cancerous ones, to die. rituximab is a biologic medicine. biologics can be made up of sugars, proteins, genetic material, human or non-human cells, and tissues (or groups of cells). rituximab is a good first-line treatment option for ltb-fl as per treatment guidelines like the national comprehension cancer network (nccn) guidelines. pf-05280586 is another biologic medicine. pf-05280586 was made to be like rituxan\u00ae or mabthera\u00ae. it was designed to have a similar structure and work in the same way that rituxan\u00ae or mabthera\u00ae do. this type of medicine is known as a biosimilar. pf-05280586 was the investigational medicine in this study. an investigational medicine is one that is not approved for sale in any country. the table on the next page shows the differences between rituximab (the \u201cbiologic\u201d) and pf-05280586, (the medicine tested to see if it was a \u201cbiosimilar\u201d to rituximab) in this study. wwwhhhaaattt hhhaaappppppeeennneeeddd ddduuurrriiinnnggg ttthhheee ssstttuuudddyyy???

was pf-05280586 as effective as rituximab? researchers wanted to compare whether pf-05280586 was as effective as rituximab for patients with ltb-fl. in this study, patients received either pf-05280586 or rituximab in an infusion once per week for 4 weeks. patients were checked to see if they had a complete response or a partial response to the treatment. a complete response is when there is no evidence of cancer after treatment. a partial response is when the cancer has improved after treatment. at the week 26 visit, 148 patients (76%, or 148 of 196 patients) who were in the pf-05280586 group had a complete or partial response to treatment. 140 patients (71%, or 140 of 198 patients) who were in the rituximab group had a complete or partial response to treatment at the week 26 visit. the amount of patients who had a complete or partial response at week 26 was comparable between the 2 groups. based on these results, the researchers have concluded that the results are not likely the result of chance. was the safety of taking pf-05280586 comparable to rituximab? patients were given a variety of different tests, such as physical exams by doctors, ecgs (a test to see how well your heart is working), collection of information (such as medical problems the patient was experiencing during the study), vital signs, and blood and urine tests (see below picture). based on the data collected from these tests, getting infusions of pf-05280586 once per week for 4 weeks had comparable safety to rituximab for patients with ltb-fl. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. what medical problems did patients have during the study? the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. 190 out of 393 patients who received at least one dose of study medicine (either pf-05280586, or rituximab) in this study had at least 1 non-serious medical problem. a non-serious medical problem means that it is not life-threatening, does not cause lasting problems, or does not need hospital care. 97 patients (49%, or 97 out of 197 patients) in the rituximab treatment group had at least 1 non-serious medical problem. 93 patients (47%, or 93 out of 196 patients) in the pf-5280586 treatment group had at least 1 non-serious medical problem. between the 2 treatment groups, the medical problems were comparable in type and how often they occurred. they were also comparable to the known medical problems which can be caused by rituximab. the most common non-serious medical problems reported by participants in this study are listed on the next page. were there any serious medical problems? a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is either life-threatening or causes death, causes lasting problems, is considered medically important by the study doctor, or needs hospital care. 32 patients (8%, or 32 out of 393 patients) had serious medical problems. a total of 15 patients in the rituximab group had a serious medical problem. 17 patients in the pf-05280586 group had a serious medical problem. the most common serious medical problem experienced in both treatment groups was infection. 4 patients (2%, or 4 out of 196 patients) in the pf-05280586 group and 3 patients (2%, or 3 out of 197 patients) had an infection. 2 patients died during the study because their cancer got worse (known as disease progression). 1 patient was in the pf-05280586 group and 1 patient was in the rituximab group. both deaths occurred more than 4 weeks after the study ended. the deaths were considered by researchers to not be related to study treatment. where can i learn more about this study?
