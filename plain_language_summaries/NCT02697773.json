{"why was this study done?": " osteoarthritis is a common disease of the joints that can happen when the cartilage, a protective tissue that covers the joints, begins to wear down over time. this can cause symptoms such as pain, tenderness, stiffness, and loss of flexibility in the affected joints. it can also cause \u201cbone spurs\u201d, or extra pieces of bone, to form around the joints. there is currently no cure for osteoarthritis, but doctors can prescribe medicines to manage pain and other symptoms. these medicines may not work well for all patients with osteoarthritis, so researchers are looking for additional treatment options. tanezumab is being studied as a possible treatment option for osteoarthritis. because it is still being tested, tanezumab has not been approved for use in patients. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about how tanezumab works to treat osteoarthritis symptoms. the researchers wanted to answer this question: \uf0b7 did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo? a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. ", "what happened during the study?": " this study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients taking tanezumab would have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms. to answer the research question, the researchers looked at 3 smaller questions: \uf0b7 change in amount of pain due to osteoarthritis, from before study treatment to week 16 of the study. \uf0b7 change in amount of physical difficulty due to osteoarthritis, from before study treatment to week 16 of the study. \uf0b7 change in overall functioning, from before study treatment to week 16 of the study. the study included adult patients with osteoarthritis in the hip or knee, who did not get adequate pain relief from certain other pain medicines, or who were unable or unwilling to take certain other pain medicines. first, patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were appropriate to join the study. this was known as the \u201cscreening period\u201d, which lasted up to 37 days. during this time, x-rays of the joints were taken, and osteoarthritis pain was assessed. the next part of the study was the \u201ctreatment period\u201d, which lasted 16 weeks. patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be compared. study treatments were given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously). patients received a total of 2 injections during the study, 1 on the first day of the study and a second one 8 weeks later. the study treatments included: \uf0b7 group 1: tanezumab 2.5 mg (day 1), and tanezumab 5 mg (week 8) \uf0b7 group 2: tanezumab 2.5 mg (day 1), and tanezumab 2.5 mg (week 8) \uf0b7 group 3: placebo (day 1), and placebo (week 8) the patients and researchers did not know who took tanezumab and who took the placebo, since all treatment options looked the same. this is known as a \u201cblinded\u201d study. at study visits in the clinic, starting at the screening visit, the patients completed questionnaires, like the questionnaires about pain from osteoarthritis, physical disability from osteoarthritis, and overall well-being that were used to answer the research question. they also let the staff know about illnesses and discomforts, and had assessments (like physical exam, blood pressure, and more) done by the study doctors and other qualified personnel. finally, there was a follow-up period, which lasted 24 weeks. during this time, the study doctors monitored the patients for any medical problems. the figure below shows what happened during this study. while patients were only in the study for about 40 weeks, the entire study took almost 2 \u00bd years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 73 locations in canada and the united states. it began 21 january 2016 and ended 14 may 2018. 243 men (35%) and 453 women (65%) participated. all patients were between the ages of 27 and 85. patients were to be treated for 16 weeks and complete the 24-week follow-up period. a total of 696 patients joined the study and received study treatment. of these patients, 582 (84%) finished the study. there were 114 patients (16%) who left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. when the study ended in may 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. ", "what were the results of the study?": " did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo? to answer this question, the researchers looked at the patients\u2019 questionnaire results rating their osteoarthritis symptoms in 3 areas (pain, physical difficulty due to osteoarthritis, and overall functioning) from before the start of study treatment and from week 16 to see if there was an improvement. on average, patients who received tanezumab at either dosing regimen had a greater improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo. on average, patients who received tanezumab 2.5 mg for dose 1 and 5 mg for dose 2 also had a slightly greater improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms compared to patients who received 2 doses of tanezumab 2.5 mg. the researchers have decided that these results are not likely a result of chance. tanezumab may be an option for treating patients with osteoarthritis. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. ", "what medical problems did participants have during the study?": " the researchers recorded any medical problems the patients had during the study. patients could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the patient was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. of the 696 patients who received study treatment, 352 (51%) patients had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 5 (1%) patients left the study because of medical problems. the most common medical problems are listed below. ", "were there any serious medical problems?": " a medical problem is considered \u201cserious\u201d when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. a total of 17 out of 696 patients (2%) in the study had serious medical problems, including 8 patients (4%) who received tanezumab 2.5 mg for dose 1 and 5 mg for dose 2, 4 patients (2%) who received tanezumab 2.5 mg for both doses, and 5 patients (2%) who received placebo. 2 patients died during the study. both patients received tanezumab 2.5 mg for dose 1 and 5 mg for dose 2. the study doctors did not consider these deaths to be related to the study treatment. ", "where can i learn more about this study?": " if you have questions about the results of your study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site. the full scientific report of this study is available online at: www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct02697773 please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which medicines can work and are safe for patients. an additional study with tanezumab is currently ongoing. again, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help patients, and you helped us to do that!
