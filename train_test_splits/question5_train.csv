" a medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 25 out of 93 patients (27%) had at least 1 serious medical problem, including 6 out of 38 patients (16%) with val30met who received tafamidis in their previous study, 9 out of 37 patients (24%) with val30met who received placebo followed by tafamidis in their previous study, and 10 out of 18 patients (56%) without val30met who received tafamidis in their previous study. a total of 11 out of 93 patients (12%) died during the study or the follow-up period, including 3 patients with val30met who received tafamidis in their previous study (8%), 1 patient with val30met who received placebo followed by tafamidis in their previous study (3%), and 7 patients without val30met who received tafamidis in their previous study (39%). none of these deaths were considered to be related to tafamidis by the study doctors. the table below shows the most common serious medical problems. overall, the study results suggest that long-term treatment with tafamidis 20 milligrams, taken once per day every day by mouth, was well-tolerated in patients with attr-pn. no new safety concerns were identified during this study. what were the results of the study? to answer the study questions, the researchers looked at 3 groups of patients. the groups were based on whether patients had the val30met mutation and when tafamidis was started:  group 1: 38 patients with the val30met mutation who received tafamidis for 30 months in their previous studies.  group 2: 37 patients with the val30met mutation who received placebo for 18 months followed by 12 months of tafamidis in their previous studies. a placebo does not have any active ingredients in it, but it looks just like the study drug.  group 3: 18 patients without the val30met mutation who received tafamidis for 12 months in their previous study.  in patients with the val30met mutation, those in the tafamidis only group (group 1) had less worsening of neuropathy impairment in the legs and feet at month 66, compared to those in the placebo followed by tafamidis group (group 2). results show the benefits of earlier treatment with tafamidis.  in patients with the val30met mutation, the ability to perform activities of daily living (such as personal hygiene and feeding) slightly improved from month 30 to month 66 for those in the tafamidis only group (group 1). the ability to perform activities of daily living slightly worsened from month 30 to month 66 for those in the placebo followed by tafamidis group (group 2).  in patients with the val30met mutation, the ability to walk worsened more for those in the placebo followed by tafamidis group (group 2) at year 6, compared to those in the tafamidis only group (group 1). after year 6, there were not enough patients with the val30met mutation in the study to draw further conclusions on changes in ability to walk.  in patients with the val30met mutation who received tafamidis only (group 1), quality of life showed little change from the beginning of the study to month 30, then worsened from month 30 to month 66. in patients with the val30met mutation who received placebo followed by tafamidis (group 2), quality of life worsened from the beginning of the study to month 18, then improved from month 42 to month 66 (after tafamidis was started at month 18).  after month 66, there were not enough patients with the val30met mutation in the study to draw further conclusions about the effects of tafamidis.  there were no patients without the val30met mutation treated with placebo in previous studies. this makes it more difficult to understand the effects of tafamidis in group 3. impairment in the lower limbs, ability to perform activities of daily living and quality of life generally worsened over time in group 3.  in patients without the val30met mutation (group 3), ability to walk worsened more quickly at year 5 compared to those patients with the val30met mutation, and did not change further by year 9. over time, patients were able to be prescribed tafamidis by their doctor or left the study. the earlier that patients in this study started taking tafamidis, the more they benefited from treatment. tafamidis may be an option for treating patients with attr-pn, and starting tafamidis treatment early may be beneficial. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary.
