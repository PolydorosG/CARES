" the first part of this study was set up to determine the best dose of gedatolisib (the test medicine) when taken in combination with another drug. the first part of this study compared 3 groups of patients that were given gedatolisib at different doses in combination with 1 of 3 other treatments. both the patients and researchers knew who took which medicine. the figure below shows the 3 groups in the study. *completed the study means those patients that stayed in the study and did not leave early due to either the cancer getting worse or because of medical problems. 3 the first part of the study included patients who were:  aged 18 years or over  had a diagnosis of specific types of advanced cancer as described in the table above. patients were unable to take part in the first part of the study if they had active brain cancer, severe heart disease, or had experienced a heart attack in the previous 12 months. the time that patients spent in the overall study varied depending on the individual. there was no maximum to the number of cycles of treatment that a patient could undergo. the entire study took over 6 years to complete. 4 patients were to be treated until their cancer got worse, until they had unacceptable medical problems or until they chose to stop. of the 85 patients who were treated and who started the first part of the study to find the best dose, 45 finished the study. forty (40) patients did not finish the first part of the study because they left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. the second part of the study was an extension of arm b and was made up of patients with triple negative breast cancer taking gedatolisib plus cisplatin. all the patients in this second part of the study were aged 18 years or over and were selected because their cancer had spread. this group was spilt into 2 further groups as shown in the table below: - arm 1  patients who had not received chemotherapy to try to kill their cancer cells after the cancer had spread. - arm 2  patients who had received 1 or 2 rounds of chemotherapy to try and kill their cancer cells after their cancer had spread. patients were unable to take part in the second part of the study if they had active brain cancer or if they had received 3 or more rounds of chemotherapy to try to kill their cancer cells after it had spread. this part of the study only included people with triple negative breast cancer, 22 patients started the study and 12 patients finished the study. ten (10) patients left this part of the study before the end. 5 the sponsor ran this whole study at 16 locations in 5 countries including the united states (us), canada, united kingdom (uk), italy and spain. it began 10 september 2013 and ended 8 january 2020. in total 34 men and 73 women took part in the overall study including both part 1 and 2 of the study. all patients were between the ages of 22 and 74. when the overall study ended in january 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. 6 "," Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in other (monotherapy) studies, the study will test increasing doses of PF-05212384 in combination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinib in order to select the best dose to administer in the MTD expansion portion of the study. A modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment in Arms A and B.33,34 The actual dose selected for the next cohort will take into account the recommended dose by using the adjusted mTPI method as well as safety data other than DLTs. In Arm C in order to evaluate concurrent doses of dacomitinib in combination with two concurrent doses of PF-05212384, a zone-based design will be utilized, which is a modified 3+3 design that potentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time.35 In all arms, dose escalation will proceed until an MTD (or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Dose is reached. However, Protocol Amendment 5 includes the rationale and description for the safety and efficacy expansion with PF-05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with metastatic or locally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC). A total of 21 patients were enrolled in Arm A, 33 in Arm B and 33 patients in Arm C in the dose escalation. Original Overall Study Design OC CRPC: Castrate resistant prostate cancer; NSCLC: Non-small cell lung cancer; ABC: Advanced breast cancer; TCC: Transitional cell cancer; TNBC: Triple negative breast cancer; OC: ovarian cancer; HNSCC: Head and neck squamous cell cancer; BC: Breast cancer. If a patient discontinues PF-05212384 or the combination partner (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) due to toxicity which is specific to either agent, continuation of patient treatment within the study with single agent PF-05212384, cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis. During the dose-escalation portion, patients who have not experienced DLT at the lower doses will be treated at the next cohort which has been cleared for safety (the dose level has not been determined to exceed the MTD). For example, if a cohort of 3 patients are treated at dose level A1 for the first time and one of them experiences a DLT, then the recommended action for the next cohort of patients will be to stay at the current dose level (S); if this recommendation is accepted, then the selected dose level for the next cohort of patients will be A1; if a cohort of 3 additional patients are treated at dose level A1 and there are no more DLTs observed, then the cumulative number of patients treated at A1 is 6, and the cumulative number of patients with DLTs at A1 is 1, thus the recommendation would be to escalate the dose for the subsequent cohort (E). Recommended Action Based on Cumulative DLT Data at the Current Dose Level (Arms A and B) E = Escalate to the next higher dose level S = Stay at the current dose level D = De-escalate to the next lower dose level DU = The current dose level is unacceptably toxic and should be eliminated from further testing Initially up to 3 patients will be treated in a cohort; occasionally, due to logistical reasons, more than 3 but no more than 6 patients may be enrolled in a cohort. Dose-finding for an arm may be stopped when one of the following criteria is met:  The lowest dose level appears too toxic after at least 3 patients are dosed at that dose  The maximum sample size in dose finding of 40 evaluable patients per arm has been reached. Dose Escalation Sequence (Arm C) As in a classical 3+3 design, dose escalation is indicated if there is no DLT in 3 patients or 1 DLT in 6 patients at the current dose level. To open dose level C2h, the DLT data from the preceding two lower dose levels C2 and C1h must both indicate dose escalation, ie, no DLT observed in 3 patients or 1 DLT in 6 patients for each of them. Dose escalation will continue until the Maximum Allowable Dose level is reached or until DLTs are observed in at least 2 of the 3-6 patients treated at a dose level, leading to the conclusion that an MTD has been exceeded. For the purpose of dose escalation, any of the following adverse events occurring in the first cycle of treatment (starting from the lead-in dose through Cycle 2 Day 1) which are possibly attributable to the combination will be classified as DLTs:  Hematologic:  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days.  Arm C: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib during the 1st cycle (including the lead-in dose(s)). Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with TNBC Based on the rationale provided in Section 1.3.5.1, an expansion cohort will open with implementation of Protocol Amendment 5 to assess the clinical activity and continued overall safety profile of PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin in patients with TNBC. Treatment in the expansion portion of the study will continue until progression of disease, uncontrollable toxicity, a decision by the patient or Investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study is terminated. Patients experiencing toxicity may be managed with dose partner (cisplatin) due to toxicity which is specific to either agent, continuation of patient treatment within the study with single agent PF-05212384 or cisplatin will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis."
" this study compared 3 groups of children to find out if those taking 1 of 2 different doses of pregabalin would have less frequent seizures, compared to children taking a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. the study included children who were at least 1 month old but younger than 4 years old when the study started. all children in this study had partial onset seizures and were currently taking medicine for epilepsy. the children received 1 of 3 treatments in this study randomly (like flipping a coin) and none of the patients, parents, or researchers knew who took pregabalin and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. first, the study doctor checked each child to make sure that they met the requirements to join the study. this was called screening. children who were found to be a good fit for the study came to a baseline visit that lasted 2 to 3 days, where they were given a test called a video eeg. a video eeg measures brain activity and is used to provide a measure of seizure frequency. children who had at least 2 partial onset seizures during the baseline video eeg could continue in the study. children were then randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments during the study:  pregabalin 7 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of weight per day (71 children)  pregabalin 14 mg per kg of weight per day (34 children)  placebo (70 children) the dose of study medication was gradually increased from a starting dose to the study dose over the first 5 days of the study. next, the dose of study medication was kept the same over the next 9 days. the children then came to another visit at which the video eeg testing was repeated over 2 to 3 days. last, study medication was gradually decreased. children continued taking their other medications for epilepsy throughout the study. the chart below shows what happened during the study. each individual child was in the study for about 3 weeks. overall, the entire study took about 3  years to complete because the children did not all start at the same time. children joined the study at 1 of 113 locations in 29 countries in africa, asia, europe, north america, and south america. it began 16 september 2014 and ended 13 march 2018. a total of 103 boys and 72 girls were enrolled in the study. out of the 175 children who started the study, 169 children (97%) finished it. a total of 6 children (3%) left before the study was over, either because the parent/guardian chose for the child to leave, or because a doctor decided it was best for the child to stop the study. when the study ended in march 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN Study A0081042 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group, multicenter study to evaluate efficacy and safety of two dose levels of pregabalin compared to placebo administered TID as adjunctive therapy in pediatric subjects 1 month (44 weeks gestational age) through <4 years of age with partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. Randomization will be stratified by subject age (Stratum 1: <1 year of age; Stratum 2: 1-2 years of age; Stratum 3: >2 years of age). Subjects in each age stratum within the site will be randomized to either placebo or 1 of 2 fixed doses of pregabalin divided TID, Dose Level 1: pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day [6 mg/kg/day for subjects 1 to 3 months of age] or Dose Level 2: pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day [12 mg/kg/day for subjects 1 to 3 months of age] in a 2:2:1 ratio. To ensure that the target minimum of 48 hours of Video-EEG is obtained, the total duration of the Video-EEG baseline phase will be up to 72 hours.  9 day double-blind fixed dose treatment phase, which includes a Video-EEG evaluation over the final 3 days at the end of this 9-day phase with a target minimum of 48 hours and a total recording duration of up to 72 hours. For subjects who successfully complete the target 48 hour Video-EEG or must terminate the Video-EEG recording before the end of this 9-day phase, fixed dosing will continue until beginning the taper phase.

Subjects must have had at least 3 partial onset seizures in the month prior to screening. Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria on the first Screening Visit (Visit 1) are enrolled in the study. After verification of the diagnosis, at Visit 2, the subject is fitted with a continuous EEG recording device for a 48 hour Video-EEG baseline partial onset seizure frequency evaluation. The investigator will evaluate the baseline Video-EEG for the purpose of determining if the subject meets the inclusion criteria. Subjects who experience at least 2 partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, during the 48 hour Video-EEG observation period will be randomized to treatment at Visit 3. A central reader will evaluate the Video-EEG data to determine the number of baseline seizures for the analysis of efficacy. Subjects that are randomized, but are subsequently determined by the central reader to have less than 2 partial-onset seizures will be allowed to continue in the study. Sublects who are determined by the central reader to have potentially exclusionary seizures types will be discussed with the study clinician and investigator to determine if the subject must be withdrawn from the study. Dose Escalation Phase (5 Days) and Fixed Dose Phase (9 Days) and Taper Phase (7 Days) Subjects who complete the baseline phase and meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized in a double-blind manner at Visit 3 to one of the following study treatments in a 2:2:1 ratio (placebo: Level 1: Level 2). Study Treatments:  Placebo;  Level 1: 7.0 mg/kg/day [6 mg/kg/day for subjects 1 to 3 months of age;  Level 2: 14 mg/kg/day [12 mg/kg/day for subjects 1 to 3 months of age].

" in the beginning of the study, patients were treated with pf-06647020 once every 3 weeks (or the q3w regimen). later on in the study, patients were treated with pf-06647020 once every 2 weeks (or the q2w regimen). this was an open-label study, which means that the patients and doctors knew what the patients were being treated with. the study included patients  18 years old who met the following conditions: for all study patients:  had adequate kidney, liver, and bone marrow function for the q3w regimen:  part 1: patients with solid tumor(s) whose cancer was advanced/metastatic (spread to other parts of the body). the patients cancer either did not respond to standard therapy, or there was no standard therapy available for their cancer.  part 2: patients with one of the following types of cancer: 1. ovarian cancer (or ovca) 2. a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (or nsclc), whose cancer made medium to high amounts of the protein ptk7 3. a type of breast cancer called triple negative breast cancer (or tnbc), whose cancer made medium-high to high amounts of the protein ptk7  able to walk around, take care of themselves, and do light house work or office work. for the q2w regimen:  patients with ovarian cancer (ovca) that did not respond well to platinum-based chemotherapy, and who had received 2 or fewer regimens of systemic anti-cancer therapy (meaning that medicines were taken by mouth or intravenously [iv])  patients with nsclc whose cancer had gotten worse after treatment, who had received 3 or fewer regimens of systemic anti-cancer therapy, and whose cancer made medium to high amounts of the protein ptk7.  able to walk around, take care of themselves, and be active for more than 50% of the day, but may not be able to do light work. the graphs below show what happened during the study: while patients were treated for up to 30 months, the entire study took 5 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 10 locations in spain and the united states of america. it began 17 october 2014 and ended 05 november 2019. a total of 22 men and 126 women participated in the study. all patients were between the ages of 31 and 80. patients were to be treated until their cancer got worse, their general health got worse, they had too many medical problems, the patient wanted to stop, or until the patient had passed away. a total of 67 of the 113 patients (59%) who started the q3w regimen finished the study. a total of 13 of the 25 patients (52%) who started the q2w regimen finished the study. forty six (46) patients in the q3w regimen part and 12 patients in the q2w regimen part of the study stopped taking the study medicine, mostly due to their cancer getting worse. thirteen (13) patients who started the q3w regimen and 2 patients who started the q2w regimen passed away during the study. thirty three (33) patients who started the q3w regimen and 10 patients who started the q2w regimen left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. when the study ended in november 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Study Overview This is a Phase 1, open label, multi-center, non-randomized, multiple dose, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic study, initially designed to evaluate single agent PF-06647020 in sequential cohorts of adult patients with advanced solid tumors unresponsive to currently available therapies or for whom no standard therapy is available. Part 1 will estimate the MTD/RP2D in dose escalation cohorts in patients with advanced solid tumors unresponsive to currently available therapies or for whom no standard therapy is available. Part 2 will include approximately 87 patients enrolled at a RP2D selected by the Sponsor and Investigators from Part 1, to explore benefit from treatment and to better define the safety profile, as well as the RP2D. This expansion cohort will include approximately 22 patients with metastatic or recurrent TNBC, 45 OVCA patients and 20 patients with advanced NSCLC. The DDI sub-study is an open-label, 2-period, fixed sequence design in up to 10 patients to determine the effect of multiple-dose fluconazole, a model moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the PK of ADC (PF-06647020), total antibody (hu6M024 mAb) and unconjugated payload (PF-06380101), when fluconazole is co-administered with PF-06647020. The sub-study will be in a separate cohort from the studies for TNBC, NSCLC and OVCA, and study design and procedure details can be found in Appendix 7. Patients will participate in the study for approximately 6 months or until disease progression, (PD) as per RECIST 1.1 (or irRECIST in Cohort 3 of the Q2W regimen expansion), patient withdrawal of consent or unacceptable toxicity occurs, patient loss to follow up, or the study is terminated by the Sponsor, whichever comes first. This study is being expanded, in this Amendment 7, for safety, PK and efficacy evaluation of the Q2W dosing schedule for PF-06647020 as a single agent treatment or in combination with avelumab in patients with platinum resistant or refractory OVCA and recurrent advanced NSCLC.

Table of Potential Dose Levels *Modified Fibonacci^ scheme starts from dose level 3 The mTPI method relies upon a statistical probability algorithm, calculated using all patients treated in prior and current cohorts at the same dose level to determine where future cohorts should be on dose escalation, no change in dose, or dose de-escalation. Subsequent dose levels may not be opened until all patients entered at the current dose level have been treated and observed for at least one complete cycle and the number of DLTs among those patients in their first cycle has been determined. The Q2W regimen expansion sub-study contains a dose escalation portion (Part 1) using the mTPI method and dose expansion portion (Part 2); details of the sub-study are included in Appendix 8. For the purpose of dose escalation (Part 1), any of the following adverse events occurring in the first cycle of treatment (within 21 days of first dose or until patient receives 2nd infusion if there are treatment delays) will be classified as DLTs, unless there is a clear alternative explanation (eg, related to underlying disease/progression):  Hematologic:  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days;  Febrile neutropenia (defined as neutropenia  Grade 3 and a single body temperature >38.3C or a sustained temperature of  38C for more than one hour;  Grade 4 anemia;  Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding;  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia:  any <10,000;  10,000-25,000 for >3 days. For patients with Grade 2 hepatic transaminase or alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline as a result of liver metastasis or bone metastasis, a hepatic transaminase or alkaline phosphatase level >10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) will be considered as a DLT.  Non-hematologic, non-hepatic:  Grade 3 toxicities that are considered non-hematologic, non-hepatic major organ toxicity (excluding alopecia of any grade, Grade 3 diarrhea that responds to therapy, and Grade 3 nausea and vomiting in the absence of premedication that responds to therapy). Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome, infusion reaction, and allergic reaction will not be considered as DLTs (as it is unlikely to be dose related), but may be a reason for study discontinuation, protocol amendment (eg, pre-infusion treatments, infusion duration) and should be reviewed with Pfizer. In principle, a patient needs to be on study for at least 21 days to be evaluable for DLT observation, and may be replaced if they terminate study participation earlier than 21 days. However, in circumstances of an event not related to study drug (eg, traffic accident, clear disease progression) that leads to study termination close to/before 21 days, the patient might be deemed evaluable if the investigators and sponsor agree. Dose Expansion Phase (Part 2) The expansion cohorts will include approximately 22 patients with metastatic or recurrent TNBC, 45 OVCA patients and 20 patients with advanced NSCLC."
" this study compared 2 groups of children to learn more about the safety and effectiveness of caz-avi, compared to another antibotic medicine called cefepime. cefepime is commonly used to treat complicated uti in children. this study was for children who were diagnosed with complicated uti. the children in this study were at least 3 months old, but younger than 18 years old when they started the study. first, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit for the study. this was called screening. the children were grouped by age:  group 1 (19 children): at least 12 years old, but younger than 18 years old  group 2 (22 children): at least 6 years old, but younger than 12 years old  group 3 (18 children): at least 2 years old, but younger than 6 years old  group 4 (38 children): at least 3 months old, but younger than 2 years old the children were assigned to receive either caz-avi or cefepime. both medicines were given into a vein through a small tube and the doses were based on each childs weight. the children were picked to receive either treatment by chance alone. children received either caz-avi or cefepime for at least 3 days. depending on what the study doctor thought was best for each child, after 3 days of receiving either caz-avi or cefepime given into a vein, some children may have switched to an antibiotic medicine you can take by mouth. some children could have received either caz-avi or cefepime into a vein for up to 14 days. this was a single-blind study, which means that the children, their parents/caregivers, their study doctor, pharmacist, and most of the researchers knew which medicine they received. however, one study doctor who examined the children did not know which medicine they were given. safety was carefully monitored throughout the study. the study doctors examined each child, did blood or urine tests, and watched for any medical problems. the study doctors also followed up with the children for 27 to 50 days after they started study treatment. while children were only in the study for up to 50 days (treatment plus follow-up), the entire study took about 2 years to complete. children joined the study at 1 of 25 locations in 9 countries (czech republic, greece, hungary, poland, romania, russian federation, taiwan, turkey, and united states). the first child joined the study on 24 september 2015 and the last child finished the study on 15 september 2017. a total of 77 girls and 18 boys joined the study. children could receive study treatment for a total of 7 to 14 days, and come to a visit 8 to 15 days after the last day they got the study treatment. the children could come to a follow-up visit 27 to 50 days after the first day they got the study treatment. of the 97 children who started the study, 90 children (93%) completed it, including coming back for the last visit. a total of 7 children (7%) did not finish the study by parent/guardian choice, or because a doctor decided it was best for the child not to continue in the study. the figure below shows what happened during the study. when the study ended in september 2017, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

" this study compared 3 groups of patients taking either avelumab alone, avelumab plus pld, or pld alone. the study included adult patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer. patients in this study could have received up to 3 prior rounds of platinum-containing medicines, and must have received a platinum- containing medicine as their most recent ovarian cancer treatment. however, patients in this study could not have received prior treatment for platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer. this was an open-label study, which means that both the patients and researchers knew which medicines were being given. patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to join the study. this was known as the screening period, which lasted up to 28 days. next, patients were assigned to receive either avelumab alone, avelumab plus pld, or pld alone. patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more even to compare. the study treatments were given by iv infusion (a needle into the vein), as follows:  group 1 (187 patients): avelumab 10 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of weight, every 2 weeks  group 2 (182 patients): avelumab 10 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of weight, every 2 weeks plus pld 40 mg per square meter of body surface area, every 4 weeks  group 3 (177 patients): pld 40 mg per square meter of body surface area, every 4 weeks after patients completed study treatment, there was a short-term follow-up period that lasted for 90 days. finally, there was a long-term follow-up period, which lasted until patients left the study or the study ended. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. the amount of time that patients were in the study varied, and the study is still ongoing. the sponsor ran this study at 300 locations in 25 countries in asia, australia, europe, and north america. it began 21 december 2015. 566 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 26 and 86. patients were to complete study treatment and a 90-day short-term follow-up period, then enter the long-term follow-up period. of the 566 patients who started the study, 389 patients (69%) entered the short-term follow-up period. of these 389 patients, 205 patients (53%) either completed or remain in the follow-period. 184 patients (46%) left the study and did not complete the follow-up period by their choice, because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study, or because they passed away. in september 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected thus far. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Study Overview This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel 3-arm study in which approximately 550 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive avelumab alone, avelumab in combination with PLD, or PLD alone, as follows:  Arm A: avelumab alone;  Arm B: avelumab plus PLD;  Arm C: PLD alone. Study Randomization Design Patients will be stratified by platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant status, number of prior regimens (1 vs 2 or 3), and bulky disease (defined as presence of a tumor 5 cm) vs not. Safety Monitoring An evaluation of the safety of the avelumab plus PLD arm will be performed during the study as follows: Randomization to all three arms will begin at the start of the study. When six patients are randomized to the combination arm, enrollment in all arms will be held. After each patient in the combination arm has completed a minimum observation period of 4 weeks, the external data monitoring committe (DMC) will evaluate all available safety data. If there are no safety concerns precluding continuation of the study, enrollment will proceed. Other options may include termination of the combination arm, or enrollment of 6 more patients with an enrollment hold. These decisison will be at discretion of the DMC. A second safety evaluation will be performed by the external DMC after a total of 20 patients are enrolled on the combination arm and followed for at least 4 weeks, without an enrollment hold. The frequency of subsequent DMC meetings will be determined by the external DMC at the time of the second safety evaluation. Study Treatment Avelumab (Arm A, Arm B) 10 mg/kg will be given as a 1-hour intravenous infusion (IV) every 2 weeks (Q2W) in 4-week cycles. PLD (Arm B, Arm C) 40 mg/m2 will be given as a 1-hour IV infusion every 4 weeks (Q4W) in 4-week cycles. In Arm B, on the days that the patient receives both infusions, PLD should be administered prior to avelumab. In all patients, study treatment may continue until PD as assessed by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal, patient loss to follow up, or termination of the study by the Sponsor, whichever comes first (see Section 6.5 Patient Withdrawal). Patients should be monitored closely for toxicity and infusion related reactions. For the management of infusion-related reactions and other toxicities, see Section 5.2.6. Patients on Arm B who discontinue one study drug (avelumab or PLD) for reasons other than confirmed disease progression may continue the other study drug until withdrawal criteria are met. Patients without evidence of disease progression at the time of study treatment discontinuation should contine to undergo tumor assessment every 8 weeks until documented radiographic progressive disease, irrespective of the start of any new anticancer treatment. Patients who discontinue study treatment due to disease progression will be followed every 12 weeks for subsequent anti-cancer therapies and survival status until death or until study end. Additionally the following data will be collected: surgery, new anti cancer therapies including the date of initiation and discontinuation of each drug. These will be recorded in the case report form (CRF) until death, withdrawal of consent, or study end, whichever comes first. Tumor Assessments Tumor Assessment: Anti-tumor activity will be assessed by radiological tumor assessments at 8-week intervals until documented disease progression as assessed by BICR, using RECIST version 1.1, C CCI C . See Appendix 3,CCI and Schedule of Activies (SOA) table. For all patients radiologic tumor assessments must include chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Complete responses, partial responses and progressive disease must be confirmed on repeated imaging at least 4 weeks after initial documentation. In addition, radiological tumor assessments will also be conducted whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the time of End of Treatment/Withdrawal (if not done in the previous 4 weeks). Brain CT or MRI scans are required at baseline only when there is a suspected brain metastasis. A bone scan (bone scintigraphy) or 18FDG-PET/CT is required at baseline only if bone metastases are suspected, then every 16 weeks only if bone metastases are present at baseline. Bone imaging is also required at the time of CR confirmation for patients who have bone metastases. CA-125 will be assessed in a local lab every 4 weeks. All patients files and radiologic images will be collected for BICR assessment which will be the basis of the primary analysis for the primary endpoint (PFS). Safety Assessments Safety will be monitored at regular intervals throughout the study by means of laboratory tests and clinical visits as described in the SOA table. Biomarker Assessments A key objective of the biomarker analyses that will be performed in this study is to investigate biomarkers that are potentially predictive of treatment benefit with avelumab or the combination of avelumab and PLD. In addition, biomarker studies of tumor and blood biospecimens will be carried out to help further understand the mechanism of action of the PLD plus avelumab combination, as well as potential mechanisms of resistance. Pharmacokinetics Plasma/serum samples will be obtained from patients for PK analysis of doxorubicin (PLD samples) and avelumab. Sparse PK samples for avelumab PK will be collected from all patients treated with avelumab in the study (Arms A and B). Serial PK samples for PLD will be collected from 18 patients each in Arms B and C. Refer to the SOA and Section 7.3 for more information. Samples should be obtained from the opposite arm to the one being used for each drug IV infusion."
" how was the study done? participants were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups more similar. reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare. this trial was also double-blinded. this means that participants and doctors did not know who was given which dose of tofacitinib. this was done to make sure that the trial results were not influenced in any way. each participant in the study took 2 pills twice a day by mouth:  5 mg tofacitinib group: one 5 mg tofacitinib tablet and one placebo tablet twice a day (70 out of 140 participants in the study).  10 mg tofacitinib group: two 5 mg tofacitinib tablets twice a day (70 out of 140 participants in the study). a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine. the pills for the investigational medicine looked exactly the same as the pills for the placebo. this made it so that participants did not know to which study group they were assigned. during the entire study, participants were to come to the study site 17 times over 42 months and have their uc assessed. at 4 of these visits, participants were to have a lower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy) to look for swelling or unusual changes to the lining of their colon. a lower endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a thin, flexible tube that is inserted into the anus to view the inside of the rectum and most of the colon. the participants uc disease activity was measured using a modified mayo score. the modified mayo score rates the activity of uc based on 3 categories. each category is graded from 0 to 3, with 3 being the most severe. the 3 categories are:  category related to stool frequency (was there a change in the number of bowel movements per day)  category related to rectal bleeding (is blood seen in the stool)  category related to endoscopy results (how does the lining of the colon look) the scores from each of the 3 categories were added together to give the modified mayo score. the modified mayo score rates the disease activity of uc on a scale from 0 to 9. participants who had a score of 0 or 1 for the endoscopy results, a stool frequency score of 0 or 1, and a score of 0 for rectal bleeding were said to be in remission. any participant who experienced a worsening of their uc disease activity (flares) was allowed to have their dose adjusted during the study. this report summarizes the findings for the primary endpoint in this study. the primary endpoint is the main question in a study that researchers want to answer. in this study, the primary endpoint was studied (primary analysis) after all participants had been on the study for 6 months. the percentage of participants in remission after taking tofacitinib for 6 months was calculated for participants in the 5 mg and 10 mg tofacitinib groups. the percentage of participants in remission after 6 months was compared between the 2 groups. in addition, this report summarizes the medical issues that participants had during the entire study. the figure below shows what was to happen during the entire study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 69 locations in 20 countries in europe, north america, asia, africa, and oceania. when did this study take place? it began 16 november 2017 and ended 18 march 2022. who participated in this study? the study included adult participants who:  were participating in another study of tofacitinib (study a3921139),  had been taking 10 mg tofacitinib twice a day for at least 2 years in a row,  were in stable remission for uc on 10 mg tofacitinib twice a day for 6 months prior to beginning this study, and  had not been taking any oral corticosteroids for their uc for at least 4 weeks prior to beginning this study. overall, 92 men and 48 women participated. all participants were between the ages of 21 and 81. participants were to be treated for 42 months, with the primary analysis occurring after all participants had taken tofacitinib for 6 months. of the 140 participants who started the study, 63 finished the study. seventy-seven (77) participants did not finish the study. the most common reason participants did not finish the study was due to the sponsor ending the study earlier than originally planned (31 participants [22%]). how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for 42 months. the entire study took 52 months to complete. the study was stopped early because the primary objective of this study had been achieved. there were no concerns about the safety or effectiveness of tofacitinib. when the study ended in march 2022, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Designation of Phase 3b is for countries where approval of tofacitinib for UC has not yet been granted; Phase 4 designation is for countries where approval of tofacitinib for UC has been granted. This study will enroll subjects from currently enrolled subjects in Study A3921139 who are in stable remission on tofacitinib 10 mg BID for at least 6 months prior to enrollment. Subjects must have received tofacitinib 10 mg BID for a minimum of 2 consecutive years in Study A3921139, not be receiving any corticosteroids to treat their UC for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline in order to be eligible for this study. Subjects enrolling under Amendment 2 must not have any risk factors for pulmonary embolism as described in Section 4.2, exclusion Although approximately 130 subjects are estimated to be enrolled into this study (based on availability of eligible subjects from Study A3921139 and based on the conservative assumptions of the attrition rate of 50% - 60% in Study A3921139), the final sample size may exceed 130 subjects. The Sponsor will continue to engage with investigative sites participating in Study A3921139 to assess the ability to enroll additional eligible subjects. This study will remain double-blinded to the site and the subject to the initial treatment assignment at baseline. Study visits will occur at Baseline (Day 1, enrollment), and at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39 and 42. All subjects, who withdraw early or who complete this study, will have a 4-week safety follow-up evaluation after the last dose of investigational product. * All subjects must have an endoscopy performed in Study A3921139 6 months prior to baseline of Study A3921288 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, in order to be eligible for enrollment. If during the course of the study, a subject experiences an increase in clinical symptoms, such as an increase in rectal bleeding or an increase in stool frequency, then an endoscopy should be performed to assess if the subject is experiencing flare. In addition, subjects who experience atypical symptoms or features of their usual UC disease course or have significantly worsening disease activity assessments from the previous visit, or have the presence of risk factors such as recent antibiotic use or a recent history of C. difficile infection should have Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin testing performed before assessing for flare and performing any dose adjustments. Amendment 2 On 17 May 2019, the European Medicines Agencys (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) issued interim recommendations on the restrictions for prescriptions of tofacitinib. These interim recommendations on the restrictions for prescriptions of tofacitinib state that patients who are at high risk of blood clots in the lungs must not be started on tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and that such patients currently taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID for any condition must be switched to alternative treatments. The study investigator or designee will need to review each subjects medical history and study records, including their concomitant medications, to determine whether he/she is at high risk for developing pulmonary embolism. If a subject is identified as meeting any of the above criteria, the subjects tofacitinib dose will be adjusted to open-label 5 mg BID. The subject should return to the study site as soon as possible to receive new study medication (1 bottle of 5 mg tablets) and they should be instructed to take 1 x 5 mg tablet in the AM and 1 x 5 mg tablet in the PM. If a subject has any of the risk factors listed above, he/she will not be permitted to increase their dose of tofacitinib to 10 mg BID if he/she experiences a flare of their UC disease (see Section 5.11). The study investigator or designee will be required to ask each subject at each study visit if he/she has any newly-developed risk factors for pulmonary embolism, and if one is identified, the subject will need to have their tofacitinib dose adjusted to open-label 5 mg BID if they are taking open label 10 mg BID or are receiving blinded study medication (5 mg BID or 10 mg BID); see Section 7.3.6. At the time of Amendment 2, 138 subjects have been enrolled in the study and have each completed various durations of participation. Amendment 3 Per Amendment 3, in addition to the risk factors already listed above under Amendment 2 for pulmonary embolism, all subjects in the study will be evaluated for risk factors for venous thromboembolism.5 Two additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism to be added to the list of pulmonary embolism risk factors above include:  Prior myocardial infarction within the past 3 months; and  Being immobilized. If a subject has one or more of the risk factors for venous thromboembolism listed above under Amendment 2 and 3, the subjects tofacitinib dose will be adjusted to open-label 5 mg BID. For subjects who do not have any of the risk factors for venous thromboembolism listed above under Amendment 2 and 3, he/she will remain on their assigned tofacitinib dose. If a subject has any of the risk factors for venous thromboembolism listed above, he/she will not be permitted to increase their dose of tofacitinib to 10 mg BID if he/she experiences a Lastly, additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism, such as age, diabetes, obesity (BMI>30), smoking status, hypertension and first degree family history of venous thromboembolism should also be taken into consideration by the investigator and the Sponsor medical monitor when evaluating the benefit:risk for each individual subject whether to modify their dose of tofacitinib."
" how was the study done? researchers tested go on a group of study participants with cd33-positive aml to find out if study participants taking go had a change in their heart function. this was an open-label study, which means that the researchers and the participants knew what study medication they were receiving. apart from go, participants also received their normal medications to relieve their cancer symptoms. participants were also given medicines to help reduce symptoms such as fever and chills, known as infusion reactions, before receiving go. before being included in the study, participants were screened to see if they qualify to be in the study. during screening, a bone marrow or blood samples was collected to see if participants had cd33 on their cancer cells. participants were given 3 mg/m2 of go via intravenous (iv) infusion (using a drip) on days 1, 4 and 7 per cycle for 1 or 2 cycles. infusion of the study medication took about 2 hours on each day. some participants received go for 1 cycle, and others for 2 cycles, depending on what the research doctors felt was best, and how what side effects the participants were having due to receiving go. participants returned to the study unit for tests and biological sample collection on days 10, 15 and 21 of each cycle, and had a final end-of-treatment (eot) visit, 36 days after the last dose of go, or start of new/other anticancer treatment. after the eot visit, participants were monitored every 12 weeks for 12 months, either via phone call or by being asked to return to the study unit for assessments, during a follow-up period. participants had regular ecgs to monitor changes in their heart. participants also had other tests, and blood samples collected to monitor their safety, check the level of go in their blood and how go was processed by their body. some participants also had urine samples collected. participants were also asked about how well they were feeling, and about any other medications they were taking. the schematic of the basic study plan is shown below. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 17 locations in 6 countries in europe and north america. when did this study take place? it began on 03 july 2019 and ended on 27 april 2021. who participated in this study? a total of 66 potential participants were screened to see if they qualify to be in the study. in total, 52 participants (51 adults and 1 teenager) who had cd33-positive aml that was either relapsed or refractory, qualified to be in the study. only results for the 51 adult participants are shown in this report. participants included in the study also met specific criteria with regards to the status of their leukemia, their heart rate measurements (specifically, qt interval), and their current and previous treatments for their cancer.  a total of 31 men participated  a total of 20 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 22 years and 82 years. of the 51 adult participants in the study, 50 participants received at least 1 dose of study medication. one participant did not receive any treatment. of the 50 participants who received study medication:  46 of the 50 participants (92%) completed cycle 1 treatment, and  9 of the 50 participants (18%) completed cycle 2 treatment. two of the participants did not complete their assigned treatment due to medical problems. all 51 participants (including the 1 participant who did not receive any study medication) entered the follow-up part of the study. most of the participants (49 of the 51 participants [96%]) did not complete the follow-up part of the study, due to the following reasons:  participant passed away: 45 of the 51 participants (88%)  participant decided they did not want to be in the study anymore: 2 of the 51 participants (4%)  researchers were unable to contact the participant: 1 of the 51 participants (2%)  other reason: 1 of the 51 participants (2%) how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for about 12 months. the entire study took 1 year and 9 months to complete. when the study ended in april 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase 4 study evaluating the effect of GO on the QT, pharmacokinetics, safety, and immunogenicity of GO as a single-agent monotherapy in adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML. Approximately 50 adult patients (age 18 years) and 6 pediatric (12 years  age 17 years) patients who satisfy the study eligibility criteria will be enrolled and treated with the fractionated regimen of GO 3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, and 7 (up to 2 cycles). Triplicate ECGs will be performed at screening, baseline (prior to dose on Day 1) and right before serial PK draws on each day of dosing. All triplicate ECG tracings will be sent to an independent ECG core laboratory for blinded manual interval measurements. The active safety monitoring duration will be up to 36 days after the last dose of GO or starting of subsequent anticancer therapy, including consolidation and/or conditioning regimens. This study includes the collection of hemorrhage-related laboratory data and coagulation-related assessments, such as CBC and differential counts, PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen. Any event of VOD/SOS will continue to be reported as SAE during the entire study duration. After receiving the study treatment (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, if administered), blood cell and differential counts will be examined 3 times a week after GO dosing until having determination of remission status (see Section 7.5); subsequently CBC and differential counts will be collected once weekly until 36 days after the last dose of GO or until start of subsequent anticancer therapy, eg, consolidation or conditioning regimen. Efficacy evaluation and final determination of remission status by blood and bone marrow aspiration (and biopsy if applicable) will be conducted after recovery of blood counts is observed or at a maximum of 36 days after the last dose of GO treatment (EOT). Study duration for each patient is a total of 12 months from enrollment, survival data will be collected for the study duration of 12 months. Treatment Plan Patients enrolled in the study will be receive three doses of GO 3 mg/m2 (up to one vial) as a 2-hour intravenous infusion on Cycle 1 Days 1, 4, and 7. A second cycle 3mg/m (up to one vial) on Cycle 2 Days 1, 4, and 7 will be allowed at the investigators discretion for patients who meet the following criteria after Cycle 1: Bone marrow with a decrease of blast percentage to at least 25% or a decrease of pretreatment blast percentage by at least 50%; and Blood count with neutrophils 1,000/L and platelets 50,000/L, except in patients with the bone marrow blasts 5%, the decrease in neutrophils and platelets thought to be due to the underlying leukemia (see Section 7.5). After GO treatment, subsequent anticancer therapy such as consolidation or conditioning regimen and/or HSCT could be considered at the investigators discretion. A minimum interval of 2 months is recommended between the last dose of GO and HSCT. Figure 1.

" this study included 3 different age ranges of participants to learn about the safety and about the antibody response to 20vpnc. the main age range studied was participants 60 years old and above. the vaccines used in this study included 20vpnc, 13vpnc, ppsv23, and salt water (saline) placebo. a placebo is given in the same way as the vaccines used in study but does not have active ingredients. 20vpnc and 13vpnc looked the same; however, the saline and ppsv23 looked different and were injected by staff that were not involved in other aspects of the study. participants were asked to turn their heads when the ppsv23 or saline was injected so they would not know which one they had received. participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. this study included adult men and women who:  were at least 18 years old  were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study doctors  did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a weakened immune system  never received any vaccine for s. pneumoniae  never had a disease caused by s. pneumoniae  never had a severe medical problem caused by a vaccine or an allergic reaction to any of the components in the vaccines used in this study participants of 3 different age ranges were entered into the study.  60 years of age and older (3009 participants)  50 through 59 years of age (445 participants)  18 through 49 years of age (448 participants) next, participants in the 3 age ranges were assigned to vaccine groups by chance alone, and received the following vaccinations: 60 years and older:  vaccine group 1: 20vpnc at visit 1 and placebo at visit 2 one month later (1507participants)  vaccine group 2: 13vpnc at visit 1 and ppsv23 at visit 2 one month later (1490 participants) 50 through 59 years of age:  vaccine group 1: 20vpnc at visit 1 (334 participants)  vaccine group 2: 13vpnc at visit 1 (111 participants) 18 through 49 years of age:  vaccine group 1: 20vpnc at visit 1 (335 participants)  vaccine group 2: 13vpnc at visit 1 (112 participants) this was a randomized study, which means that participants were assigned to groups based on chance alone. randomization is done to make the groups similar so that differences in antibody response or safety are most likely due to the different vaccines participants received. this study was also double-blinded. this means that participants and study staff members who administered the vaccine did not know who was given which vaccine. this was done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way. participants 60 years of age and older were expected to participate in 3 study visits. at the first visit, blood samples were collected first and then participants received either 20vpnc or 13vpnc. the second visit was done about 1 month after the first visit. blood samples were collected before the participants received either saline placebo or ppsv23, and they were checked for medical problems. the third visit was done about 1 month after the second visit. blood samples were collected and participants were asked about medical problems. participants 18 to 59 years of age were expected to participate in 2 study visits. at the first visit, blood samples were collected first and then participants received either 20vpnc or 13vpnc. the second visit was done about 1 month after the first visit. blood samples were collected and participants were asked about medical problems. all participants were also contacted over the phone about 6 months after visit 1. the participants were asked about medical problems and whether they had received any other vaccines besides the study vaccines. the figure on the following page shows what happened during the study.  while participants were in this study for about 6 months, the entire study took more than a year to complete as participants entered the study at different times. the sponsor ran this study at 61 locations in the united states and sweden. it began 12 december 2018 and ended 16 december 2019. 1558 men (40%) and 2331 women (60%) received the study vaccines. all participants were between the ages of 18 and 91 years. of the 3902 participants who joined the study, 3690 (95%) completed it. a total of 212 participants (5%) left the study early. the most common reasons for leaving early were the participants choice or because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study. throughout the course of the study, the sponsor reviewed the data. when the study ended in december 2019 and after antibody testing was completed, the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This will be a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study that will be conducted at investigator sites in the United States and Europe. Approximately 3880 adults 18 years of age and older with no history of pneumococcal vaccination will be enrolled into 1 of 3 cohorts based on their age at enrollment, and randomized to 1 of 2 vaccine groups (20vPnC or control) (Table 3). Cohort 1: Approximately 3000 subjects will be enrolled into Cohort 1, 2000 subjects will be 60 through 64 years of age and 1000 subjects will be 65 years of age and older and stratified by age. CCI receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC (control vaccine) at Vaccination 1. Subjects in Cohort 1 who received 20vPnC at Vaccination 1 will receive saline at Vaccination 2. Subjects in Cohort 1 who received 13vPnC at Vaccination 1 will receive PPSV23 at Vaccination 2. Approximately 440 subjects 50 through 59 years of age at enrollment will be assigned to Cohort 2, and randomized (3:1) to receive 20vPnC or 13vPnC at Visit 1. Approximately 440 subjects 18 through 49 years of age at enrollment will be assigned to Cohort 3, and randomized (3:1) into 1 of 2 vaccine groups, to receive 20vPnC or 13vPnC at Visit 1. Table 3. Vaccinations Given to Each Cohort a. Single dose on Day 1. On Day 1 (Visit 1), subjects will be assessed for eligibility, have blood drawn for immunogenicity assessments, and receive 20vPnC or 13vPnC. Subjects will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination by blinded site staff, who will record AEs occurring during that time. Subjects will also receive safety follow-up and electronic diary (e-diary) instructions at the visit. Prompted systemic events (fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain) occurring within 7 days after vaccination and prompted local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) occurring at the 20vPnC or 13vPnC injection site within 10 days after vaccination will be collected daily in the e-diary. Use of antipyretic/pain medications will be collected daily in an e-diary for 7 days after vaccination. Subjects in Cohort 1 will return for Visit 2 (28 to 42 days after Visit 1), and information will be collected from the subjects on AEs, SAEs, NDCMCs, and e-diary follow-up (as needed). Blood will be drawn for immunogenicity assessments. Saline will be administered to subjects who previously received 20vPnC, and PPSV23 will be administered to subjects who previously received 13vPnC, by a third-party unblinded site staff member. Subjects will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination by blinded site staff, who will record AEs occurring during that time. Subjects will also be reminded about safety follow-up. The subjects in Cohort 1 will then return for Visit 3 (28 to 42 days after Visit 2), and information will be collected from the subjects on AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs. Blood will be drawn for immunogenicity assessments. Subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3 will return for Visit 2 (28 to 42 days after Visit 1), and information will be collected from the subjects on AEs, SAEs, NDCMCs, and e-diary follow-up (as needed). Blood will be drawn for immunogenicity assessments. Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will have a final visit, approximately 6 months (168 to 196 days) after Visit 1; for this visit, the sites will contact the subject in all cohorts via telephone to inquire about SAEs, NDCMCs, and nonstudy vaccinations, as well as concomitant medications used to treat SAEs or NDCMCs. The applicable control groups for the assessments of the 20vPnC group for each cohort are summarized in Table 4.
