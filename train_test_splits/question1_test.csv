" what is rheumatoid arthritis? rheumatoid arthritis, or ra, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. ra is an autoimmune disease, which means that patients with ra have an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as the joints. ra can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked. what is tofacitinib? tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. it is an oral (taken by mouth) prescription medicine that is used treat adults with active, moderate to severe ra that did not respond well to medicines known as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards), like methotrexate (mtx). tofacitinib may help calm the activity of the immune system and decrease ra signs and symptoms. what was the purpose of this study? researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of 2 different doses of tofacitinib, compared to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (tnf inhibitor). tnf inhibitors are another type of medicine that work to reduce the activity of the immune system. cardiovascular disease is a disease of the heart or blood vessels. researchers wanted to know: how many participants developed cancer? how many participants developed cardiovascular disease? how many participants had medical problems? ","protocol summary as a commitment to the united states food and drug administration (us fda), this post authorization safety study (pass) will evaluate the safety of tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily (bid)and tofacitinib 10 mg bid compared to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (tnfi). the primary objective of this endpoint study is to evaluate the safety of tofacitinib at two doses versus a tnfi; the co-primary endpoints are adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (mace) and adjudicated malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancersduring study participation. the study will be declared completewhen all of the following conditions are met:  at least 1500 subjects have been followed for 3 years.  the targetednumber of mace is observed.  the targetednumber of malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, is observed. to achieve all of these conditions, it is expected that the study will include approximately 4000 subjects, recruited over 3 years and the total duration of the study will be approximately 5 years after the first subject is randomized. the steering committeewill consider the ongoing accumulation of the adjudicated primary endpoint events andperformance standard metrics and may determine that sufficient events have occurred to assess the primary objectives of the study or that it is not feasible to continue the trial in pursuit of these objectives. these determinations by the steering committeewill be made in accordance with pre-specified rules documented in the steering committeecharter and in the statistical analysis plan and following consultations with the us fda, and could result in recommendations for changes to thestudy design, including changes in number of subjects studied or duration of study. subject population adult subjects who are 50 years of age or older, with moderately or severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate alone and who have certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease will be enrolled in this study. a minimum of approximately 4000 subjects will be enrolled in the study. assessments the following assessments will be used to evaluate safety:  changes in physical assessments, including weight and vital signs.  ae reporting, incidence and severity.  incidence and severity of safety laboratory abnormalities.  adherence to contraceptive use.  adherence to protocol requirements.  concomitant medication review.  review of eligibility to continue study drug. the following assessments will be used to evaluate efficacy:  28joint counts.  patient global assessment.  patient assessment of pain.  physician global assessment.  c-reactive protein (crp).  a number of patient reported outcomes, including the health assessment questionnaire disability index (haq-di). treatments all subjects will be enrolled on their previously prescribed dose of methotrexate and will be randomly assigned to one of threeactive treatment arms in the study:  tofacitinib 5 mg bid.  tofacitinib 10 mg bid.*  tnfi: adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous (sc) injection every other week in the united states, puerto rico and canada; etanercept 50 mg sc injection weeklyin all other countries. * in response to new safety information about tofacitinib that was provided to study a3921133 investigators on 19 february 2019, investigators were notified to verbally inform subjects randomized to tofacitinib 10 mg bid to reduce the dose of tofacitinib to 5 mg bid within 7 calendar days of this notification, secure their verbal agreement to continue in the study,and if they agreed, reduce their dose of tofacitinib to 5 mg bid for the remainder of the study. tofacitinib is supplied as 5 mg tablets, which allowed subjects to decrease from their previous dose of 2 tablets twice daily to 1 tablet twice daily. adjustments to methotrexate and other background medications will be allowed during the study with provisions to allow subjects who are not adequately treated with study drug to switch to standard of care while remaining in the study. the study will be open-label and the randomization scheme for the studypopulation (approximately 4000subjects) will be in a ratio of 1:1:1 with approximately1300 subjects randomized to tofacitinib 5 mg bid; approximately1300 subjects randomized to tofacitinib 10 mg bid(subjects are switched to 5 mg bid per amendment 8); and approximately1300 subjects randomized to a tnfi. safety analysis the safety analysis will include all subjects in the study. the primary statistical safety objective is the estimation of the hazard ratios relative to the tnf inhibitor control for the two tofacitinib doses combined and for each dose of tofacitinib separately for the co-primary events of major adverse cardiovascular events (mace)and malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers. analyses of primary safety endpoints will be based upon adjudicatedevents. both total time(itt) and on treatment analyses of the main safety endpoints will be conducte"
" what is advanced breast cancer? sometimes, breast cancer can spread from the breast to other parts of the body, most often to the bones, lungs, liver, or brain. this is called advanced breast cancer. advanced breast cancer cannot be treated by surgery or radiation therapy with the intention to cure the cancer, but to slow down the development of the cancer and help the patient live longer. the participants in this study had estrogen receptor- positive [er (+)] breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative [her2 (-)] advanced breast cancer. the cells of er (+) breast cancer have receptors that allow them to use the hormone estrogen to grow and her2 (-) means that the participants have a normal amount of her2 proteins in the breast cells (too much of this protein means that there is another type of cancer present). this type [er (+), her2 (-)] of advanced breast cancer is sensitive to hormonal treatment. what is palbociclib? palbociclib is a medicine that has been used to treat a specific type of breast cancer known as hormone receptor positive [hr (+)] and her2 (-). a hormone receptor is a receptor molecule that binds to a specific hormone. a breast cancer is classified as hr (+) if its cells have receptors for the hormones; estrogen and progesterone. palbociclib targets the functioning of specific proteins or enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk4 and cdk6). these enzymes are important for normal cell division and when they are damaged, they may cause cancer cells to grow and spread. certain cancers, for example, er (+), are more likely to have disturbances in cdk4 and cdk6. palbociclib prevents the cdk4 and cdk6 enzymes from functioning which stops the cells from dividing and stops the growth of breast cancer cells. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this research study was to compare the effect of the study drug, palbociclib, plus letrozole, with placebo plus letrozole to find out which is better for treating advanced breast cancer in asian women who have not received any previous systemic treatment and have already experienced menopause (stopping of menstrual periods permanently).  palbociclib is an approved medicine.  systemic treatment is any medication that travels through your body in the bloodstream to find, damage, or destroy cancer cells. it includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted therapy.  a placebo looks like the medicine under study but does not contain any medicine. researchers use a placebo to see if the study medicine works better or is safer than not taking it.  letrozole is a hormonal medicine that is approved for the treatment of advanced breast cancer that is sensitive to hormonal treatment. letrozole is available outside of this research study by a doctors prescription. researchers wanted to know: did the participants taking palbociclib plus letrozole have a better progression-free survival (pfs) than participants that were taking placebo plus letrozole?  researchers wanted to determine the pfs of participants taking palbociclib plus letrozole and compare it to the pfs of participants taking placebo plus letrozole.  the pfs is the length of time during and after receiving a treatment for a disease, during which a patient lives with the disease not getting worse. how participants tolerated palbociclib and whether it caused any medical problems?  researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety and tolerability of palbociclib.  they monitored the participants for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study. ","protocol summary indication: estrogen receptor-positive (er (+)), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (her2 (-)) advanced breast cancer (abc)in asian patients who havenot received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapyfor their advanced disease. background and rationale: breast cancer(bc) is the most common invasive cancer in women, with more than 1.3million cases and over 450,000 deaths occurring worldwide annually. in asia, the incidence of breast cancer is 26 per 100,000 individuals, the mortality rate is 9.5 per 100,000 individuals. in china, the incidence of breast cancer is 21.6 per 100,000 individuals, the mortality rate is 5.7 per 100,000 individuals. although age-adjusted mortality from breast cancer has been decreasing since 1990, the median survival for patients with metastatic disease is still only approximately 18-24 months and the medical need for more active agents in this clinical setting remains very high. the role of estrogens in breast cancer etiology and progression is well established. modification of estrogen activity or synthesis represents the treatment of choice for postmenopausal women with hormonal receptor positive advanced breast cancer, particularly for those with slowly progressive disease and limited tumor-related symptoms. letrozole is an oral nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor approved worldwide for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positiveadvanced breast cancer (abc). palbociclibis an oral cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4/6 inhibitor that has been under investigation in phase 1,2 and 3 clinical trials in multiple indications.palbociclibprevents cell cycle progression from g1 to s phase and has shown antitumor activity in multiple preclinical models, includingin estrogen receptor-positive (er+) luminal breast cancer cell lines. furthermore, pre-clinical exploration using a breast cancer cell line panel has demonstrated presence of retinoblastoma (rb)proteinand upregulation of cyclin d1 as well as decreased cdkn2a (p16) that were associated with sensitivity to palbociclibas well as with its effects upon cell cycle and growth inhibition. these gene expression findings were also associated with the luminal subtype versus basal-like subtype of bc. these results, together with published data on the interaction of estrogens and cdks and the important role of cell cycle-related proteins in the genesis and maintenance of breast cancer, led to the initiation of a randomized phase 2 clinical trial (a5481003) investigating the antitumor activity of palbociclibin combination with letrozole andsingle-agent letrozole in the first-line treatment of er(+)/her2(-) abc patients. the phase 2 study was divided into 2 parts. in part 1, patient selection was based only on er/her2 status while in part 2,patients were additionally prospectively selected taking into account tumor cyclin d1 (ccnd1)amplification and/or cdkn2a (p16)loss. final results from part 1 plus part 2 of the phase 2 portion included a total of 165 postmenopausal women with er(+) / her2(-) locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer enrolled to either receive palbociclib in combination with letrozole (n=84 patients) or letrozole monotherapy (n=81patients). the combination therapy was generally well tolerated when compared to letrozole alone with adverse events (aes)similar to those seen with palbociclib and letrozole when administered alone,with the exception of hematologic toxicity. neutropenia(48%), leukopenia(19%) and anemia(5%)were the most frequent treatment-related grade3 adverse events in patients treated with the combination therapy. grade 4 treatment-related events included neutropenia and anemia, reported in 6% and 1% , respectively, of patients treated with palbociclibplus letrozole. however, the neutropenia observed with the combination in this study was non-cumulative and clinically manageable. neutropenia is an on-target, anti- proliferative side effect of palbociclib and signifies inhibition of cdk4 and its effect on bone marrow. efficacy analyses were performed on the basis of radiologic assessment of disease status by investigators to determine preliminary antitumor activity according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist)v.1.0. median progression free survival (pfs)was prolonged in patients who received combination therapy compared to letrozole alone (20.2 months vs. 10.2 months). objective response and clinical benefit rates (43% vs. 33% and 81% vs.58%, respectively) were also superior with the combination therapy. based on the encouraging results from this phase 2 study in abc, a global randomized phase 3 study (a5481008) of palbociclib in combination with letrozole is currently on-goingin postmenopausal patients with er(+), her2(-) abc. a phase 1 study (a5481010) is ongoing to evaluate pharmacokinetic (pk), safety, tolerability and efficacy of palbociclib in japanese patients with advanced solid tumors and er(+), her2(-) abc. to support the"
" a urinary tract infection, or uti, is the name for an infection in part of the urinary system, such as the bladder or urethra. children with a uti may have symptoms such as needing to urinate more often, pain when urinating, or blood in the urine. utis are usually caused by bacteria, and they are usually simple to treat. however, sometimes utis can be harder to treat and may require someone to be in the hospital to be treated with intravenous (iv) antibiotics. when this happens, it is known as a complicated uti. ceftazidime-avibactam (caz-avi) is an antibotic medicine which is used to treat a number of infections caused by certain types of bacteria. caz-avi is currently used to treat serious infections, such as complicated uti, in adults. this study was designed to learn more about using caz-avi to treat complicated uti in children. caz-avi has not been approved for use in children, as it is still being studied. the ceftazidime half of caz-avi has previously been approved for use in children. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use of caz-avi in children with complicated uti, compared to another antibiotic medicine called cefepime. the researchers wanted to answer this main question:  for children treated with caz-avi, how well was it tolerated, and were there any new medical problems different from those that can happen when using ceftazidime alone? in addition, the researchers also wanted to see how many children in the study were cured or had an improvement in their infection (complicated uti).

" what is sasanlimab? sasanlimab (sah-san-lih-mab) is a new experimental drug for cancer treatment that is currently not approved for sale or for use outside of a clinical trial. sasanlimab is a type of medicine called an antibody. antibodies are special proteins made by the immune system that recognize and stick to specific proteins on the surface of germs or cells. sasanlimab recognizes a protein called pd-1 that is located on your immune cells. sasanlimab blocks pd-1 from interacting with another protein, pd-l1, located on the surface of tumors. blocking this interaction may help the immune system slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. what was the purpose of this study? this study was divided into 2 parts. the main purpose of part 1 of this study was to learn about the safety of sasanlimab, and to find the best dose of sasanlimab to use to treat cancer in phase 2 trials. to do this, the researchers asked,  what medical problems did participants have while taking sasanlimab?  what dose-limiting toxicities (dlts) did participants have when taking sasanlimab? dlts are certain medical problems caused by taking sasanlimab, which require the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the medicine temporarily or permanently. these medical problems could also stop the use of the drug at that dosage in all patients. the main purpose of part 2 of this study was to learn more about the safety of sasanlimab, and to measure if any of the patients cancer got better during the study. to do this, the researchers asked,  what medical problems did participants have while taking sasanlimab?  how many participants had their cancer get better when taking sasanlimab? researchers wanted to know:  what medical problems did patients have while taking sasanlimab?  what dose-limiting toxicities (dlts) did patients have when taking sasanlimab in part 1 of the study?  how many patients had their cancer get better when taking sasanlimab in part 2 of the study? ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background Binding of the programmed cell death protein-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the  programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) receptor found on T cells inhibits T-cell  proliferation, cytokine production, and its cytotoxic functions. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands  occurs in certain tumor types, and signaling through this pathway can contribute to the  inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors.1  In syngeneic mouse tumor  models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth. Approval of  nivolumab/Opdivo (a fully human immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4] anti-PD-1 antibody [Ab]), pembrolizumab/Keytruda (a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 Ab), atezolizumab/Tecentriq (a humanized IgG1 anti-PD-L1 Ab), durvalumab/Imfizi (a humanize IgG1 anti-PD-1  antibody), and avelumab/Bavencio (a fully human IgG1 anti-PDL-1 Ab) for the treatment of  multiple tumor indications provide compelling evidence that blockage of the PD-1 pathway is a validated immunotherapeutic approach. PF-06801591 is a humanized, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that  binds to the PD-1 receptor. By blocking its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2,  PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response is released, leading to an anti-tumor immune response. In this clinical study, intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC)  administration of PF-06801591 will be evaluated for the treatment of adult patients with  locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor types with clinical evidence of response to antiPD-1 or PD-L1 agents. Study Overview This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose, dose escalation and expansion,  safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic study of PF-06801591. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and early signs of efficacy of PF-06801591. This  clinical study will be divided into a dose escalation (Part 1) phase, and a dose expansion  (Part 2) phase. Approximately 140 patients are expected to be enrolled into the study.  Part 1 Dose Escalation Part 1 dose escalation will evaluate 4 pre-specified IV dose levels (0.5, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg),  and 1 SC dose level (300 mg) in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic  melanoma, squamous cell cancer of head and neck (SCCHN), ovarian cancer, sarcoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma, or other solid tumor types with  clinical evidence of response to anti PD-1 or PD-L1 agents, who are unresponsive to  currently available therapies or for whom no standard therapy is available. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled into Part 1. The actual number of patients enrolled in Part 1 will  depend on the observed safety and tolerability profile of PF-06801591, and the number of  dose levels required to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). For the IV administration portion, a cycle is definied as 1 dose of PF-06801591 administered  every 3 weeks (q3w). The IV dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period is defined as  starting on Day 1 of study drug administration through Day 21 of the treatment cycle. For  the SC administration portion, a cycle is defined as 1 dose of PF-06801591 administered every 4 weeks (q4w). The SC administration DLT observation period is defined as starting  on Day 1 of study drug administration through Day 28 of the treatment cycle. A staggered  start will be employed for both IV and SC administration portions: a single patient will be  dosed and observed for 48 hours. If no safety concerns arise during this 48-hour period,  additional patients may be enrolled into the same dose level.  The 300 mg SC administration cohort will enroll patients concurrently with the IV  administration portion, following evaluation of the 3 mg/kg IV administration dose level. If  the 300 mg dose administered by SC is deemed intolerable, a lower dose level of 150 mg  maybe evaluated.  Part 1 will be further divided into Part 1A (safety cohort) and Part 1B (pharmacodynamic  cohort). For both IV and SC administration portions, each safety cohort will enroll  2-4 patients per dose level. A modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method,7 targeting a DLT rate of 27.5% will be utilized for dose escalation. In the IV  administration portion, if based on Part 1A information the dose level is deemed safe and  well- tolerated, an additional 2 to 5 patients will enroll into the same dose level in Part 1B. In the SC administration portion, if based on Part 1A information the 300 mg dose level is deemed safe and well- tolerated, an additional 11 (approximate) patients will be enrolled into  Part 1B. Up to approximately 9 patients may be enrolled into each dose level in the IV  administration portion, and up to approximately 15 patients may be enrolled into the 300 mg  SC administration portion (Part 1A and Part 1B combined). The mTPI approach would be  applied across Parts 1A and 1B to ensure that the administered doses do not surpass the  toxicity boundaries. Safety data from all patients in Parts 1A (safety cohort) and available  data at cutoff from Parts 1B (pharmacodynamic cohort) will be used to determine the MTD. Tumor biopsies collected at pre and post treatment time points (screening and Cycle 2  Day 8 [C2D8]) are mandatory for all Part 1B patients. Part 2 Dose Expansion Part 2 will enroll approximately 70 patients with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment nave  NSCLC and approximately 30 patients with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment nave  urothelial carcinoma who progressed on, or were intolerant to systemic therapy or for whom  systemic therapy was refused or unavailable.

" ovarian cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the ovaries, which are the female reproductive organs that produce eggs. ovarian cancer is a major cause of cancer death in women. researchers are looking for treatments for ovarian cancer. avelumab is a medicine that is currently used to treat different types of cancer, which may work by targeting a protein called pd-l1. pd-l1 is involved in the bodys immune system response to cancer. when this study was started, avelumab was still being tested for use in women with ovarian cancer. avelumab is not approved for use in women with ovarian cancer. medicines containing platinum are commonly used to treat ovarian cancer, but these medicines may not work well for all patients. the main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of avelumab in patients with ovarian cancer, particularly those who did not have satisfactory improvement in ovarian cancer symptoms from medicines containing platinum. these patients are said to have ovarian cancer that is platinum resistant or platinum refractory. patients in this study may have also received another medicine for ovarian cancer, called pegylated liposomal doxyrubicin (pld). researchers wanted to answer 2 main questions:  how long did patients who were assigned to receive either avelumab alone or avelumab plus pld survive, compared to patients who were assigned to receive pld alone?  how long did patients who were assigned to receive either avelumab alone or avelumab plus pld survive without ovarian cancer getting worse, compared to patients who were assigned to receive pld alone? ","protocol summary background and rationale: ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer and the fifth most common cause of cancer mortality in women. the incidence of ovarian cancer increases with age and is most prevalent in the eighth decade of life. the median age at the time of diagnosis is 63 years, and 70% of patients present with advanced disease.3 although expectations for long-term survival can be very high if the cancer is identified and treated early, the women diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer continue to have less than 30%5-year survival. patients are considered to have platinum-sensitive disease if they respond to first-line platinum therapy and experience a relapse-free period of greater than 6 months following the last dose of platinum therapy. platinum-resistant disease is defined by relapse between 0to 6months after the last platinum dose. platinum-refractory disease is defined by lack of response to platinum-based chemotherapy or recurrence prior to completion of platinum-based therapy.46 there are no highly effective therapies in the platinum-resistant/refractory population, although non-platinum-related agents have demonstrated modest antitumor efficacy in a subset of these patients. programmed death ligand 1 (pd-l1,also called b7-h1 or cd274) and its receptor, pd-1, have a known role in the suppression of t-cell responses. the pd-1 receptor is expressed on activated cd4+ and cd8+ t cells. by interaction with its ligands, pd-l1 and pd-l2, pd-1 delivers a series of strong inhibitory signals to inhibit t-cell function.7,8,9 avelumab*(msb0010718c), a fully human antibody of the immunoglobulin g1 (igg1) isotype, specifically targets and blocks pd-l1, the ligand for pd-1 receptor. in preclinical studies, combination of avelumab with chemotherapies showed improved anti-tumor activity.1 prelimenary data from the ongoing ovarian cancerstudy emr 100070-001, which is being conducted by merck kgaa/emd serono (eudract number 2013-002834-19, nct01772004) showed an objective response rate (orr)of 10.7% (8/75) and stable disease in an additional 44%(33/75) of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. certain chemotherapy agents, including doxorubicin, have been shown to have immunostimulatory properties.52 preclinical evaluation of breast tumor and sarcoma responses to anthracyclines suggested that immune mechanisms contribute to tumor growth inhibition.50 *avelumab is the proposed international nonproprietary name (inn) for the anti-pd-l1 monoclonal antibody (msb0010718c) in addition, expression of genes such as cd8, cd8, and ifn-correlated with response to anthracycline chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.50 enhanced exposure of tumor antigens as a result of tumor cell kill may enhance the activity of immune checkpoint blockade.47 in preclinical studies, combination of avelumab with chemotherapies showed improved anti-tumor activity of chemotherapy (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, 5fu).1 taken together, these observations suggest that combination of anthracyclines with avelumab may provide added clinical benefit relative to either agent alone.51 study objectives primary objectives  to demonstrate that avelumab given alone or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin(pld) is superior to (pld) alone inprolonging overall survival (os)in patients with platinum -resistant/platinum-refractory ovarian cancer.  to demonstrate that avelumab given alone or in combination with pld is superior to pld alone in prolonging pfs in patients with platinum-resistant/platinum-refractory ovarian cancer. secondary objectives  to evaluate anti-tumor activity of avelumab given alone or in combination with pld versus pld alone in ovarian cancer patients.  to evaluate the overall safety profile of avelumab alone or in combination with pld versus pld alone in ovarian cancer patients.  to characterize the pharmacokinetics (pk) of doxorubicin (pld samples) and avelumab when administered in combination, and to assess the effect of avelumab on the pk of doxorubicin (pld samples) andthe effect of pld on pk of avelumab.  to assess the immunogenicity of avelumab.  to evaluate candidate predictive biomarkers of sensitivity or resistance to avelumab alone orpld in combination with avelumab in pre-treatment tumor tissue, that may aid in the identification of patient subpopulations most likely to benefit from treatment.  to comparethe effect of avelumab alone or in combination with pld versus pld alone on patient-reported outcomes (pro) in patients with ovarian cancer. exploratory objectives cci study endpoints primary endpoints  overall survival (os).  pfs as determined by blinded independent central review (bicr) according to recist version 1.1. secondary endpoints  efficacy: objective response, duration of response (dr), and disease control (dc) as determined by blinded independent central review (bicr) and investigator [as assessed by recist version 1.1].

" alopecia areata (aa) is an autoimmune skin disease that causes hair loss ranging from small patches to a loss of all hair on the head and body. aa occurs when the immune system mistakes normal cells in the body as foreign invaders and attacks these cells. there is no cure for aa and most countries do not have an approved treatment for aa. treatments that reduce the activity of parts of the immune system are often used to treat aa, but some of these treatments can cause other health problems or can only be used for short periods of time. researchers are looking for new treatments for aa that can be taken safely for longer periods of time. two (2) drugs were tested in this study: pf-06651600 and pf-06700841. pf-06651600 and pf-06700841 are both experimental drugs that have not been approved for sale yet. pf-06651600 blocks the activity of proteins called janus kinase 3 and the tec family kinases. pf-06700841 blocks the activity of 2 other enzymes called janus kinase 1 and tyrosine-protein kinase 2. these enzymes act like on/off switches for the cells of the immune system. by turning off these switches, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines, a different type of protein, that are believed to make aa worse. the researchers wanted to know,  were patients who took pf-06651600 or pf-06700841 more likely to have their aa improve compared to patients who were treated with a placebo? to do this, researchers measured the severity of each patients aa at the beginning of the study. the researchers measured the severity of aa after 24 weeks of treatment. the difference in severity was used to decide if a patients aa had improved or not. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY  Background and Rationale: The janus kinase (JAK) family, including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (TYK2), is a group of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via  interactions with Type 1 and Type 2 cytokine receptors critical for leukocyte activation,  proliferation, survival and function. Cytokine receptors demonstrate restricted association  with JAKs such that different receptors or receptor classes preferentially utilize a given JAK  dimer combination to transduce their signal. JAK1 pairs with JAK3 to mediate -common  cytokine signaling and also with JAK2 or TYK2 to transmit the signals of additional  cytokines important in inflammation and immune responses including interleukin (IL) -2, -4,  -5, -6, -12, -13, -15, -21, -23, -31, interferon gamma (IFN), and interferon alpha (IFN).  Following cytokine activation, receptor-associated JAKs are phosphorylated and in turn  phosphorylate specific sites on the receptor intracellular domain. Phosphorylation of specific  sites on the intracellular domain of the receptor allows for the recruitment of signal  transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) that can subsequently be phosphorylated  by JAKs. 16  Phosphorylated STAT molecules are released from the receptor, translocate to  the nucleus where they bind to specific sites on the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and  regulate gene transcription. 18 The tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma  (TEC) kinase family consists of five members including TEC, Brutons tyrosine kinase  (BTK), bone marrow-expressed kinase (BMX), inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) and resting  lymphocyte kinase (RLK/TXK), that are primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells. TEC  kinases play an important role in antigen receptor signaling and BTK and ITK regulate the  signal transduction pathways initiated by the activation of B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell  receptor (TCR), respectively. 31,27 PF-06651600 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits irreversibly JAK3 with  selectivity over the other three JAK isoforms, JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2. PF-06651600 also  inhibits irreversibly the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase  family (BTK, BMX, ITK, TEC, TXK), with high selectivity over the broader kinome.  PF-06651600 inhibits the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells which have been  implicated in the pathogenic process of AA.34,30 This inhibition may be mediated through  mechanisms dependent on JAK3 and TEC kinase family members. 33,28,29 PF-06651600 also  potently inhibits signaling of the JAK3-dependent receptors for IL-15 and IL-21, which have  been implicated in the pathogenic pathways of AA. 32 PF-06700841 is a dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor with a good selectivity profile over the other  human kinases including JAK2. TYK2/JAK1 are critical signaling kinases that regulate the  signal transduction pathways triggered by several cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of  AA, including IFN, IL-2, IL-15, IL-12, and IL-23.4,25,6 Both compounds will be investigated in patients with AA.

" what is atopic dermatitis? atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that can cause many symptoms, such as itching, redness, and a rash that is scaling or oozing. the symptoms can look different on different people. atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema. there is no known cure for this condition. people with atopic dermatitis often have this condition for many years, and may have flare ups, when their symptoms worsen for a time. what is crisaborole? crisaborole is a medicine that is used to treat atopic dermatitis. it is applied to the skin as an ointment twice a day. crisaborole may improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis by decreasing inflammation in the skin. inflammation is the bodys immune system response, which can lead to symptoms such as redness. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of the study was to see if the symptoms of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis were reduced when crisaborole ointment was applied twice a day to the affected area compared to when a vehicle ointment was used. the vehicle ointment does not have any medicine in it, but it looks and feels just like the crisaborole ointment. some participants in the study were given hydrocortisone butyrate cream (a topical corticosteroid) and others used pimecrolimus cream (a topical calcineurin inhibitor) rather than the crisaborole ointment or vehicle ointment. topical means a treatment that is used on the skin. corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitor creams are commonly used to treat atopic dermatitis. the researchers also included treatment with these 2 creams in the study because they also wanted to see what happened when hydrocortisone butyrate cream and pimecrolimus cream were used instead of crisaborole or vehicle ointment. researchers wanted to know: did symptoms of atopic dermatitis improve in areas of skin treated with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin treated with vehicle ointment or the comparator creams? "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: Crisaborole, also referred to as PF-06930164 or AN2728, is a low molecular weight benzoxaborole anti-inflammatory phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor that penetrates into the skin to the sites of inflammation. PDE-4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. While the specific mechanism(s) by which crisaborole exerts its therapeutic action is not well defined, crisaborole reduces the production of several inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD). Supporting evidence forthe safety and efficacy of this product in patients 2 years and older represents a major advancement in the treatment of AD given the challenges of managing this common, chronic dermatologic condition and the limitations of currently available therapies. All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant in the two previous Phase3 vehicle-controlled studies, AN2728-AD-301 and AN2728-AD-302. Across the development program, crisaborole demonstrated an acceptable safety profile; the majorityof adverse events (AEs)were mild and deemed unlikely or not related to investigational product, with no crisaborole treatment related serious adverse events (SAEs) (except 1 case of drug eruption in a Phase 2 study which was classified as possibly related). This 4-week,randomized, assessor blinded, crisaborole ointment, 2%, vehicle and active (topical corticosteroid [TCS] and topical calcineurin inhibitor [TCI])controlled study will determine the efficacyand safetyof crisaborole ointment,2% applied twice daily (BID) compared with vehicle in subjects ages 2 years and older with mild to moderateAD. The study will also evaluate the efficacyand safetyof crisaborole ointment,2% compared with the active controls; hydrocortisone butyrate cream, 0.1% [TCS] and pimecrolimus cream, 1%[TCI]. Hence,this study will, provide contextualization of theefficacyand safetyof crisaborole ointment, 2% in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. The crisaborole dose strength and regimen selected for this study has been demonstrated to be safe, well-tolerated and efficaciousin subjects and healthy volunteers 2 years of age and older who participated in previous studies. Hydrocortisone butyrate cream,0.1% and pimecrolimus cream,1% are approved products for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in subjects ages 2 years and older, and will be used as per their national approved label in this study.

" what is respiratory syncytial virus (rsv)? respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is a virus that can cause an infection with symptoms that are similar to a bad cold, such as cough, fever, sore throat, and runny nose. this infection can be serious in older adults and in those with underlying medical conditions. people with serious rsv infection may have trouble breathing and may need to be hospitalized. what is the rsv vaccine (rsvpref)? this study is about a vaccine called the respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, or rsvpref. a vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight off germs. rsvpref may be able to help prevent infections caused by rsv. rsvpref contains proteins found in the virus that may stimulate the bodys response to make antibodies (known as the immune response), which may protect against rsv disease. there is no live virus in rsvpref. in older adults, immune responses decrease with age, so vaccines may require additional ingredients (known as adjuvants), which may improve the immune response against infection. rsvpref used in this study contains either:  rsvpref on its own,  or rsvpref with aluminum hydroxide,  or rsvpref with aluminum hydroxide and cpg adjuvant vaccines containing aluminum hydroxide have been used safely in vaccines for more than 70 years. vaccines containing cpg have been given in research studies of other vaccines, and cpg is included in a vaccine approved for use in the united states to protect against hepatitis b (a liver virus infection). rsvpref is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by rsv. this study is the first time that rsvpref with cpg adjuvant has been tested in people. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of rsvpref in healthy older adults. researchers wanted to know:  how many of the study participants: o had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 14 days of their first rsvpref vaccination? o had nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, diarrhea, tiredness, or fever within 14 days after their first rsvpref vaccination? o had medical problems within 1 month after their first rsvpref vaccination? o had serious medical problems or medical problems that required treatment from a doctor within 1 year after their first rsvpref vaccination? "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Indication The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) stabilized prefusion F subunit vaccine (RSV vaccine) is being developed for the following indication:  Prevention of RSV-associated moderate to severe lower respiratory tract disease in adults 60 years of age and older via active immunization. Primary Objective: Primary Endpoints: Primary Study Cohort -Stage 1 Primary Study Cohort -Stage1 To describe the safety and tolerability of an  Local reactions within 14 days after adjuvanted RSV vaccine given concomitantly Vaccination 1. with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine  Systemic events within 14 days after (SIIV). Vaccination1.  Adverse events (AEs) within 1 month after Vaccination 1.  Medically attended AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) through 12 months after Vaccination 1(from Visit 1 through Visit 5). Study Design This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-and formulation-finding studytodescribe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of up to 7 different RSV vaccine candidates with bivalent formulations (RSVA and RSVB) at 3 dose levels of 60 g of the prefusion RSV F antigens CCI 120 g (CCI and 240 g CCI formulated withaluminum hydroxide (Al[OH] )or CpG/Al(OH) , or a240 gRSV vaccine CCI 3 3 alone, when administered concomitantly with SIIV, or without SIIV in a Month-0, Month-2 schedule. The dose for the RSV vaccine alonewas selected based on 1-month postvaccination immunogenicity data from the sentinel-cohort subjects in StudyC3671001 (A Phase 1/2, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Observer-Blind, Dose-Finding, First-in-Human Study to Describe the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of aRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Vaccine in Healthy Adults; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03529773). The C3671002 study was initiated under protocol Amendment 2 during the southern hemisphere influenza season; however, a delay in SIIV availability prevented completion of enrollment of the original cohort. Consequently, only 250 subjects of the planned 312 subjects were enrolled. In Amendment 3, this cohort will be referred to as the Primary Study Cohort -Stage1. Enrollment in the Primary Study Cohort -Stage1 commenced in April 2019 and completed enrollment in June 2019. Approximately 250 subjects 65 to 85 years of age received 2 intramuscular injections at Visit 1 to assess the concomitant administration of SIIV when given to subjects receiving one of the 3 RSV vaccine dose-level candidates formulated with Al(OH) or CpG/Al(OH) or the 3 3 RSV vaccinealone dose (seeSection 6.1for further details). The first 4 subjects vaccinated in the study were observed by blinded site staff for any acute reactions for at least 4 hours after vaccination. Vaccination of the remaining subjects commencedno sooner than 48 hours after the fourth subject received his or her vaccination. Vaccination of subjects was limited to a maximum of 6 subjects per day during the first week of enrollment (up to 30 vaccinated subjects in total). Follow-up will continue through Month 12. Protocol Amendment 3 will address 2 broad goals: 1. Evaluate a 2-dose regimen administered 2 months apart to determine whether a short dosing interval elicits an enhanced immune response. Due to the deficit in the originally planned subject enrollment, approximately62 subjects aged 65-85 years will be randomized 1:1 toreceive a dose of 240 g RSV vaccine with CpG/Al(OH) or placebo followed by a second dose 2 months later. Safety, tolerability, 3 and immunogenicity will be evaluated. This cohort will be known as the RSV Vaccine Month-0, Month-2 Cohort. Thesubjects will be enrolled before the influenza season. There will be no concomitant SIIV administration. 2. Evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a second dose of RSV vaccine administered to the Primary Study Cohort -Stage1 subjects, 12 months after the initial dose to determine whether the immune response supports annual vaccination. The safety and immunogenicity data from C3671001 and Stage 1 of C3671002 will guide the decision on whether a second dose of the RSV vaccine will be evaluated in Stage 2. If Stage 2 proceeds,this cohort will be known as the Primary Study Cohort - Stage2. If there are no substantial differences in immune responses between the CpG/Al(OH) and 3 Al(OH) formulations,then development of the CpG/Al(OH) formulation may cease, and 3 3 Stage 2 will not proceed."
" what is cd33-positive acute myeloid leukemia? acute myeloid leukemia (or aml) is a type of blood cancer. this cancer is caused by too many immature white blood cells being made in the bone marrow. this reduces the ability of the body to make normal blood cells such as white blood cells (that fight off infections), red blood cells (that deliver oxygen to muscles and organs), and platelets (that help blood clot). in normal cells, cd33 is a protein that is involved in helping cells communicate and connect/bond to things. they are also involved in cell growth. cancer cells may grow more quickly. participants in this study had cd33-postive aml, which means that they had the cd33 protein on the surface of their cancer cells. their cd33-positive aml was either:  relapsed: this means that the patient had a response to their most recent cancer treatment, but the cancer came back. or  refractory: this means that the patient did not have any response to their most recent cancer treatment, or the disease got worse while receiving the most recent treatment. what is gemtuzumab ozogamicin (mylotarg)? gemtuzumab ozogamicin (go) (mylotarg) is an antibody that attaches to myeloid cells (a type of cell in the bone marrow and blood) that have the cd33 protein. once attached to the cancer cells, the drug delivers a substance into the cells and causes the diseased cell to die. at the time of this study go is the only approved aml therapy that specifically targets the cd33 protein. in the united states (us), go is approved for treating adults and children 1 month and older who have been diagnosed with cd33-positive aml for the first time. it is also approved for treating relapsed or refractory cd33-positive aml in adults and children 2 years and older. participants in this study had relapsed or refractory cd33-positive aml. in the european union, go is approved (to be given in combination with some other anti-cancer medications) for treating participants 15 years and older, who have been diagnosed with cd33-positive aml for the first time and have not previously been treated for their aml. the food and drug administration (fda) asked the researchers to do some additional tests to see whether go has an effect on the heart function (described in next section). what was the purpose of this study? the main goal of this study was to see if taking go has an effect on the heart function (specifically the qt interval) of participants with aml. in this study, researchers used an electrocardiogram (ecg) machine, to measure heart function. the qt interval is a measurement made on the ecg that measures the electrical activity for part of the heart function. the researchers wanted to see if there were any changes in the qt interval after taking go, compared to before taking go. specifically, researchers wanted to see if go causes qt prolongation. qt prolongation occurs when the heart takes longer to contract and relax. this can affect the heart rhythm (beating of the heart) and can lead to life-threatening heart rhythm disorder. to make sure the comparisons were accurate, researchers adjusted or corrected the qt interval using a special formula. this is so qt interval values could be compared for different heart rates. the corrected qt interval is called qtc. in this study, the corrected qtc values used to described results is called qtcf. researchers wanted to know: did the participants have a change in their heart function (measured by qt change) after taking go, compared to before taking go? "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, MYLOTARG) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the cluster of differentiation33 (CD33)-directed monoclonal antibody hP67.6 (recombinant humanized immunoglobulin [Ig] G4, kappa antibody produced by mammalian cell culture in NS0 cells) that is covalently linked to the cytotoxic agent N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide (DMH), a semisynthetic disulfide derivative of calicheamicin. The antibody portion binds specifically to the CD33 antigen, a sialic acid-dependent adhesion protein found on the surface of myeloid leukemic blasts and immature normal cells of myelomonocytic lineage, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. On 01 September 2017,the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved GO (MYLOTARG) for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and for the treatment of adult or pediatric patients at least 2 years of age with relapsed/refractory CD33-positive AML.1 In adults with newly diagnosed CD33-positive AML, GO can be administered as part of a combination regimen (ie,fractionated dose of 3mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, and 7 combined with daunorubicin [DNR] and cytarabine [Ara-C] during induction) or as a single agent (ie, 6mg/m2 on Day1 and 3mg/m2 on Day8 of induction). In the setting of relapsed/refractory CD33-positive AML in patients aged 2 years and older, GO is approved for use as a single agent only using the fractionated dosing regimen (ie, 3mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, and 7).1 During their review of the Biologics License Application (BLA), the FDA issued post-marketing requirements (PMRs) that requested additional assessment of the impact of the fractionated dosing regimen of GO on the risk of veno-occlusive disease or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) in patients with previous or subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), hemorrhage, unexpected serious risk of QTinterval prolongation, and unexpected serious risk of anti-drug antibodies. Additionally, no clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) data for GO, represented by total hP67.6antibody, have been characterized following the fractionated dosing regimen. The PK profiles included in the BLA used for exposure-response modeling of the pivotal Phase3 trial, ie, Acute Leukemia French Association0701 (ALFA-0701),2 were simulated using population PK modeling based on 8previous clinical trials. Therefore, B1761031 has been planned to address these PMRs. On 22 February 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, and on 19 April 2018 the European Commission granted a marketing authorization for Mylotarg, indicated for combination therapy with DNR and Ara-C for the treatment of patients age 15 years and above with previously untreated, denovo CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

Therefore, this study will include 6pediatric patients 12-17 years of age (eg, adolescents).

" what is alopecia areata? alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder, which may be chronic and reoccurring, where a patient experiences non-scarring hair loss. it can affect adults and children across all ages, races, and sexes. alopecia areata can have a large impact on the psychological health of both adult and pediatric patients, including damage to the patients self-esteem, an increased occurrence of anxiety and depression and other psychological conditions, problems with social relationships, decreased health-related quality of life and a general decline in quality of life. patchy alopecia areata is the most common form of alopecia areata, which may develop into more widespread and often treatment-resistant forms of alopecia areata, especially when the disease starts at an earlier age. alopecia areata involving 50% or greater scalp hair loss, including the loss of all the hair on the scalp (alopecia totalis) and the loss of all scalp, face and body hair (alopecia universalis) can be considered extensive forms of alopecia areata. what is ritlecitinib? ritlecitinib is a small molecule oral medication. small molecules can move easily through the cell membrane to interact with targeted molecules present inside a cell. ritlecitinib inhibits the enzymes (protein molecule in cells which speed up chemical reactions in the body) known as a janus kinase 3 (jak3) and tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (tec) family. these enzymes are important regulators of inflammatory pathways in the cell and cause the production of molecules known as cytokines. it is believed that these inflammatory pathways and cytokines are involved in dermatologic diseases such as vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, as well as alopecia areata. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this study was to compare ritlecitinib with a placebo to determine ritlecitinibs efficacy and safety in treating alopecia areata patients. ritlecitinib is an investigational medication because it is not approved for use. the placebo looks like the study medication but does not contain any active ingredients. researchers compared the results of taking the placebo to the results of taking ritlecitinib to see if there were any differences. researchers wanted to know: did the participants taking ritlecitinib have a better response than the participants taking placebo at week 24? ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic relapsing T-cell mediated autoimmune disorder  characterized by non-scarring hair loss affecting children and adults across all ages, races,  and sexes.7,8  AA is associated with other immune diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis,  atopic dermatitis, and autoimmune diseases such as thyroiditis and vitiligo.8 CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and mast cells are involved in the pathogenesis of  AA. The possible inflammatory pathways in AA include cytokines from the type 1 helper  T cell (TH1) axis, including interferon (IFN) alpha (), IFN gamma (), and IFN-induced  protein 10 (IP-10).7,9  Mouse models have shown that interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15 play a role  in the initiation of auto-reactive CD8+ cells that attack hair follicles.1  IL-12 and IL-23 may also play a role in the pathogenesis of AA.11 Clinical presentation of AA can be limited to small, circular patches of scalp hair loss (patchy  hair loss, alopecia focalis), involve complete loss of hair on the scalp (alopecia totalis [AT]),  or total loss of hair on the scalp and body (alopecia universalis [AU]).12  AA involving  50% or greater scalp hair loss, including AT and AU, is considered an advanced form of  alopecia, according to the United States (US) National Alopecia Areata Foundation.13  Patchy alopecia is the most common form of AA which may develop into the more extensive and  often treatment-resistant forms of AA, especially with earlier age of onset. It is estimated  that AA affects as many as 6 to 7 million individuals in the US8 and 147 million worldwide.13   AA is a disease with a significant pediatric prevalence, in addition to the burden of disease  seen in adults. A substantial body of evidence demonstrates a widespread impact of AA on  the psychological health of both adult and pediatric patients with AA, including impairment  in self-esteem, increased incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders and other  psychological conditions,21-25 problems with social relations,26 decreased health-related  quality of life (HRQoL) and general quality of life (QoL), as well as the QoL of their  families.27-35 No drugs have been approved for the treatment of AA in most countries/regions, including  the US and the European Union (EU). Review of treatment guidelines and recommendations  indicate that a number of off label therapies are frequently used after assessing factors such  as the age of the patient, disease extent and disease duration. However, there is neither a cure  for AA, nor is there a therapy convincingly demonstrated to induce and sustain remission  long term.38-42 PF-06651600 is an orally bioavailable, small molecule that is currently being investigated in  patients with AA. PF-06651600 inhibits, by irreversibly blocking the adenosine triphosphate  (ATP) binding site, Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and the tyrosine kinase expressed in  hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase family (BTK, BMX, ITK, TEC, TXK), with high  selectivity over the other three JAK isoforms, JAK1, JAK2, and tyrosine kinase 2 [TYK2], as  well as over the broader kinome. PF-06651600 potently inhibits signaling of the common  -chain receptors for IL-15 and IL-21, which have been implicated in the pathogenic  pathways of AA.1  Additionally, PF-06651600 inhibits the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells which have also been implicated in the pathogenic process of AA.2,3  This  inhibition may be mediated through mechanisms dependent on JAK3 and TEC kinase family members.4,5,6 Objectives and Endpoints:  The following table details the overall study objectives and endpoints.

" streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections of the lung (pneumonia), brain lining (meningitis), blood (bacteremia), or ear (otitis). these infections may be very serious in young children and older adults. streptococcus pneumoniae is also known as s. pneumoniae. there are 100 types of s. pneumoniae. this study is about a vaccine called the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or 20vpnc. a vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight off germs. 20vpnc may help to prevent infections caused by s. pneumoniae. it is called 20-valent because 20vpnc prevents 20 of the most common types of s. pneumoniae. 20vpnc is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by s. pneumoniae, although studies are ongoing to assess how well 20vpnc works. after a vaccine is injected into a persons body, the body responds to help fight infections and prevent diseases. the response to vaccines includes making antibodies, which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent diseases. in the united states, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or 13vpnc, is currently approved for preventing s. pneumoniae diseases in children and adults. 13vpnc is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 13 types of s. pneumoniae. 20vpnc has the same components found in 13vpnc, plus 7 additional components that may widen protection. the pneumovax 23 vaccine, or ppsv23, is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 23 types of s. pneumoniae. the purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and about the antibody response to 20vpnc. to learn about the antibody response, researchers asked these questions:  for the 13 components found in both 13vpnc and 20vpnc, did participants aged 60 or older who received 20vpnc have antibody responses that were within a range considered to be comparable (noninferior) to those who received 13vpnc?  for the 7 additional components found in both ppsv23 and 20vpnc, did participants aged 60 or older who received 20vpnc have antibody responses that were within a range comparable to those who received ppsv23? to answer this question, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in participants blood 1 month after being vaccinated. to learn about the safety of 20vpnc, researchers asked these questions:  what percentage of participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 10 days after being vaccinated?  what percentage of participants had fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after being vaccinated?  what significant medical problems did participants have within 1 month after being vaccinated?  did participants have any newly diagnosed chronic medical problems or any serious medical problems within 6 months after being vaccinated? "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale Streptococcus pneumoniaeare gram-positive encapsulated cocci that have been a leading cause of bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) and continue to be a major global public health concern. Serious pneumococcal disease may occur at any age; however, children <5 years and adults 65 years of age are at particularly increased risk. Individuals with certain comorbidities and immunocompromising conditions are also at risk. S pneumoniaeremains an important cause of serious disease in the United States and worldwide. Globally, pneumococcal pneumonia was estimated to cause approximately 1,517,000 deaths in 2015 and, across all ages, accounted for approximately 55% of deaths due to lowerrespiratory tract infections. The polysaccharide capsule has been identified as an important virulence factor for this pathogen. While more than 95 pneumococcal serotypes differentiated by their capsular polysaccharide composition have been identified, only a subset of serotypes are more commonly associated with severe disease. Pneumococcal disease can be prevented with polysaccharide-based vaccines that induce antibody responses with functional (opsonophagocytic) activity and target the capsular serotypes responsible for disease. Pneumococcal vaccines that contain free polysaccharides, such as the licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) formulated with capsular polysaccharides for 23 pneumococcal serotypes, elicit a T-cellindependent immune response. These vaccines are poorly immunogenic for many of the serotypes contained in the vaccine in children less than 2 years of age, immunocompromised populations, and older adults. They do not induce memory responses in any population, and have limited or no protection against nonbacteremic disease, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which contain capsular polysaccharides covalently linked to a protein carrier, elicit a T-celldependent immune response inducing protective responses in young children, older adults, and populations with high-risk conditions, as well as memory responses and protection against nonbacteremic disease. Prevnar (7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), which was licensed in the United States in 2000, and Prevnar 13 (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [13vPnC]), which was licensed in the United States in 2010, are pneumococcal conjugate vaccines containing 7 and 13 capsular polysaccharides, respectively. The pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides in those vaccines are individually conjugated to cross-reactive material 197 (CRM ), a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin. These vaccines target serotypes that caused 197 the majority of pneumococcal disease in infants and older adults at the time of their introduction. They have demonstrated efficacy/effectiveness against vaccine-type (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), AOM, and pneumonia and the ability to reduce nasopharyngeal carriage and transmission, resulting in indirect beneficial effects. Pfizer is developing a new 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) candidate to further expand protection against the global burden of vaccine-preventable pneumococcal disease in children and adults over that of Prevnar 13. 20vPnC has the same composition as Prevnar 13, but contains an additional 7 pneumococcal conjugates to protect against serotypes responsible for a substantial burden of remaining pneumococcal disease. 20vPnC uses the same platform as Prevnar and Prevnar 13 and contains components that have undergone extensive clinical research. Safety and immunogenicity data from a 20vPnC Phase 1 study conducted in healthy adults 18 through49 years of age and from a Phase 2 study in adults 60 through64 years of age demonstrate the vaccine induces immune responses to the 20 vaccine serotypes and has a safety profile consistent with other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Thesedata support clinical development in adult and pediatric populations. See the 20vPnC investigators brochure for additional details. CCI The Phase 3 study described in this protocol will provide safety data in adults 18 years of age and provide key immunogenicity data in each of 3 specific age groups (18 through 49, 50 through 59, and60 years of age). Study Design This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study will be conducted at investigator sites in the United States and Europe. Approximately 3880 adults 18 years of age and older with no history of pneumococcal vaccination will be enrolled into 1 of 3 cohorts based on their age at enrollment,andrandomizedto1 of 2 vaccine groups (20vPnC or control). Cohort 1: Approximately 3000 subjects 60 years of age and olderat enrollment will be assigned to Cohort 1 and will be randomized (1:1) into 1 of 2 vaccine groups. Each subject will receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC (control vaccine) at Vaccination 1. Subjects in Cohort 1 who received 20vPnC at Vaccination1 will receive saline at Vaccination2. Subjects in Cohort 1 who received 13vPnC at Vaccination1 will receive PPSV23 at Vaccination 2. Approximately 2000 subjects 60 through 64 years of age and 1000 subjects 65 years of age and older will be enrolled and stratified by age. Cohort 2: Approximately 440 subjects 50 through 59 years of age at enrollment will be assigned to Cohort 2 and randomized (3:1) into 1 of 2 vaccine groups to receive 20vPnC or 13vPnC at Visit 1. Cohort 3: Approximately 440 subjects 18 through 49 years of age at enrollment will be assigned to Cohort 3 and randomized (3:1) into 1 of 2 vaccine groups to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC at Visit 1. On Day 1 (Visit 1), subjects will be assessed for eligibility, have blood drawn for immunogenicity assessments, and receive 20vPnC or 13vPnC. Subjects will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination by blinded site staff, who will record adverse events (AEs)occurring during that time. Subjects will also receive safety follow-up and electronic diary (e-diary) instructions at the visit. Prompted systemic events (fever, headache, fatigue,"
" what is dyslipidemia? dyslipidemia is a condition in which the blood has an abnormal level of lipids (or fats) called cholesterol and triglycerides (tg). levels of one or both lipids can be abnormal in dyslipidemia. high levels of cholesterol or tg increase the risk for heart disease (heart attack) or stroke. this is because fatty deposits in the blood vessels can build up and block the blood flow from the heart. there are different types of cholesterol, which have different effects on the body. non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-hdl-c) can tell how much cholesterols there are in the blood that can lead to heart disease or stroke. a high level of non-hdl-c means a higher risk of heart disease or stroke. what is vupanorsen? vupanorsen is an injectable study medicine given through a needle inserted under the skin. it has not been approved for general use at the time of this study. researchers think that vupanorsen can lower the levels of non-hdl-c and tg in the blood. researchers also think that taking vupanorsen for a longer period of time could help to lower the risk of heart disease. what was the purpose of this study? this study aimed to learn about the effects of vupanorsen after 24 weeks on the:  levels of non-hdl-c and tg in the blood  amount of fat in the liver researchers wanted to know: 1. did participants have a lower level of non-hdl-c after taking vupanorsen for 24 weeks? 2. did participants have a lower level of tg after taking vupanorsen for 24 weeks? 3. did participants have a change in the amount of liver fat after taking vupanorsen for 24 weeks? what happened during the study? how was the study done? in this study, researchers tested 7 doses of vupanorsen on a group of participants. researchers then compared the results of participants taking vupanorsen to the results of participants taking a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like vupanorsen. this was a double-blind study. this means the participants and researchers did not know which treatment the participants got. throughout the study, participants continued to take their statin medicine. statins belong to a class of medicine that lowers the cholesterol levels in the blood.  on day 1 of the study, participants got assigned to a treatment group by chance, and they took their first dose of study treatment (vupanorsen or placebo).  participants then continued to take their assigned study treatment for 24 weeks. they took the study treatment either at home or at the study site.  participants returned to the study site for a follow-up visit 12 weeks after their last dose. figure 1.

Estimands:The primary estimand of this study will follow the hypothetical estimand approach to estimate the effect of treatment under the hypothetical condition that all participants maintained their randomized treatment through Week 24. This estimand is meant to estimate the pharmacological effect of the drug when taken as directed. It includes the following 4attributes:  Population: Participants with dyslipidemia taking a statin who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Variable: The percent change from baseline in non-HDL-C at Week 24.  Intercurrent event: All off-treatment data (ie, occurring at least 1 dosing interval after discontinuation of treatment) or data collected post treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (ie, change in statin dose or addition of TG lowering therapy), if collected, will be excluded from analysis.  Population-level summary: Difference of variable means between vupanorsen and placebo. Overall Design This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, 8-arm parallel-group study in adults 40 years of age with dyslipidemia who are on a stable dose of a statin (with or without ezetimibe). Following the Screening Period to confirm eligibility, a total of approximately 260 participants will be randomized in the study to receive SC doses of vupanorsenor placebo administered Q2W or Q4W for the purpose of assessing efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vupanorsen. The total duration of treatment in the study is 24 weeks with an additional 12-week safety follow-up period. The sponsor, along with academic leadership of the study (TIMI Study Group), will monitor the proportion of participants enrolled according to statin intensity to ensure that an adequate number of participants on high intensity statin are enrolled. High intensity statin use is defined as atorvastatin (40 mg or 80 mg per day) or rosuvastatin (20 mg or 40 mg per day). All other statin regimens are considered low or moderate intensity. Approximately 40% or more of participants enrolled should be on high intensity statin therapy, and enrollment of participants using low/moderate intensity statin may be capped."
