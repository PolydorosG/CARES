" a medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 5 out of 301 participants (2%) in the booster stage had at least 1 serious medical problem, which were not considered related to the vaccine. no participants died during the study. ","  safety results: in summary, a booster vaccination of bivalent rlp2086, given approximately 4 years after the primary series, was generally well tolerated with a satisfactory safety profile as assessed by the primary and exploratory safety endpoints. additionally, no delayed onset safety signals were identified during the 4 years following the primary vaccination series. during the booster stage, any local reaction was reported by a similar proportion of subjects across all 5 primary vaccination schedules (84.4% to 93.8% of subjects). pain at the injection site was the most commonly reported local reaction, reported by 84.4% to 93.5% of subjects. most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature with onset 1 to 2 days after vaccination and lasting 2 to 3 days. a similar proportion of subjects across all 5 primary vaccination schedules reported any systemic event (68.8% to 76.6% of subjects). the majority of events were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature with onset 1 to 3 days after vaccination and lasting 1 to 4 days. during stage 1 were considered unrelated by the investigator to primary vaccination in the primary studies and were predominantly developmental conditions or common ailments otherwise anticipated in this population. three (3) subjects reported aes assessed as related by investigators during the booster vaccination phase (1 nonserious ae of worsening of psoriasis, 2 nonserious aes of dizziness [1 subject], and 1 sae of influenza-like illness). one (1) other sae was reported during the booster vaccination phase (meniscus injury). during the booster follow-up phase (from 1 month after booster vaccination [visit 8] through 6 months after booster vaccination [visit 9]), unrelated saes of pyelonephritis, suicide attempt, and depression were reported. the safety profile of bivalent rlp2086, when given as a single booster vaccination up to 4 years after primary vaccination, is similar regardless of the schedule for the primary series, and is consistent with the known safety profile for bivalent rlp2086 given according to the licensed primary series schedules. conclusion(s): when administered according to either a 2- or 3-dose schedule, bivalent rlp2086 affords protective immune responses to a high proportion of adolescents 10 to 18 years of age. during the first 12 months after the primary vaccination series the proportion of subjects with protective hsba titers declines but remains higher than baseline, regardless of the 2- or 3-dose schedule, and remains stable through 48 months after primary vaccination. regardless of the primary series vaccination schedule, booster responses were robust with higher proportions of subjects achieving protective titers 1, 12, and 26 months after the booster vaccination compared to 1, 12, and 24 months after the primary series. the booster vaccination was well tolerated in this cohort and the safety profile was acceptable."
" a medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. no participants in this study had a serious medical problem. no participants died during this study. ","  safety results: a similar proportion of subjects in the acwy-tt group and menps group reported at least 1 local or general solicited event during the 4-day postbooster vaccination period (40.9% versus 37.5%, respectively). no grade 3 events were reported in the menps group. the proportion of subjects reporting at least 1 ae during the 31-day postbooster vaccination period was 9.1% (15 subjects) in the acwy-tt group and 3.6% (2 subjects) in the menps group. most reported unsolicited aes were in the system organ class (soc) of infections and infestations (7 [4.3%] in the acwy-tt group and 2 [3.6%] in the menps group). three (3) aes in the acwy-tt group (1 report each of dizziness, hypoesthesia, and oropharyngeal pain) were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. none of the aes in the menps group were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. no related grade 3 aes were reported during this study. no deaths, saes, new-onset of chronic illnesses, or other significant aes were reported during this study. no saes were reported as having occurred between study menacwy-tt-015 (107386) and enrollment in the current study. most solicited local or general events were mild or moderate in severity and none led to study withdrawal. no subjects were withdrawn from the study for safety-related reasons. conclusions: antibody persistence at years 7 to 10 after primary vaccination was higher among subjects primed with menacwy-tt compared with subjects primed with mencevax acwy, as measured by the percentage of subjects with rsba-mena, rsba-menw-135, and rsba-men-y titers greater than or equal to predefined cutoff values. while a robust menacwy-tt booster vaccination response was observed in both vaccine groups, greater gmts were observed in subjects primed with menacwy-tt compared with subjects primed with mencevax acwy at 1 month after booster vaccination. no new safety concerns or adverse reactions for nimenrix were identified in this long-term persistence study of subjects 11 to 55 years of age who received a primary vaccination of either menacwy-tt or mencevax acwy (study menacwy-tt-015 [107386]) and who subsequently received a booster dose of menacwy-tt 10 years after primary vaccination. overall, the results of the analysis at 7 to 10 years after primary vaccination and up to 6 months after booster vaccination continue to support a favorable benefit-risk assessment of menacwy-tt in this age group."
