" a medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. forty six (46, or 44%) patients taking crizotinib and 13 patients (13%) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy had serious medical problems. at the end of the study, 62 patients assigned to take crizotinib and 61 patients assigned to platinum-based chemotherapy had passed away. most deaths were due to the patients nsclc getting worse. two (2) patients taking crizotinib passed away from medical problems that their doctor thought might have been caused by taking crizotinib. serious medical problems are summarized in the table on the next page.  "," ae data summaries included ae data captured in the crf until the end of study or the start of new systemic anticancer therapy for those patients who received new systemic anticancer therapy. the duration of study treatment was longer in the crizotinib group (median 67.8 weeks) than in the chemotherapy group (median 18.4 weeks). the ae analyses presented below were not adjusted for the longer duration of study treatment for the crizotinib group compared with the chemotherapy group. adverse events (aes) the treatment-emergent non-serious aes reported in 5% of subjects in any of the treatment group by preferred term and by system organ class (all causality and treatment-related) are summarized in table 10. overall, 102 (98.08%) subjects in the crizotinib group and 100 (99.01%) subjects in the chemotherapy group experienced all causality treatment-emergent, non-serious aes. all causality non-serious aes of diarrhoea, visual impairment, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, oedema peripheral, headache, pain in extremity, dizziness, nasopharyngitis, sinus bradycardia, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, and vision blurred were reported with a meaningfully higher frequency in the crizotinib group than in the chemotherapy group. all causality non-serious aes of anaemia, neutropenia, platelet count decreased, haemoglobin decreased, white blood cell count decreased and hyponatraemia were reported with a meaningfully higher frequency in the chemotherapy group than in the crizotinib group. serious adverse events (saes) saes by preferred term and by system organ class (all-causality and treatment-related) are summarized in table 11. all-causality saes were reported for 34 (32.69%) subjects in the crizotinib group and 13 (12.87%) subjects in the chemotherapy group. any treatment-related saes were reported in a total of 6 (5.77%) subjects in the crizotinib group and 3 (2.97%) subjects in the chemotherapy group. aes associated with permanent discontinuation of study treatment because the frequency of certain medical concepts or conditions may have been underestimated by reliance on single meddra preferred terms, certain preferred terms were analyzed in aggregate using clustered terms. aes associated with permanent discontinuation of study treatment regardless of causality by preferred term and clustered term (capital letters) are summarized in table 12. the percentages of subjects with all-causality aes associated with permanent discontinuation from study treatment were reported for 19 (18.3%) crizotinib-treated subjects and 4 (4.0%) chemotherapy-treated subjects. abbreviations: ae=adverse event; meddra=medical dictionary for regulatory activities; n/n=number of subjects.aonly includes data before crossover to crizotinib for those subjects who crossed over from chemotherapy to receive crizotinib treatment. deaths: grade 5 all-causality aes were reported for 17 (16.3%) crizotinib-treated subjects and 2 (1.9%) chemotherapy-treated subjects (table 13). included in the total are 2 crizotinib-treated subjects and 1 chemotherapy-treated subject, whose deaths occurred >28 days after the last dose of study treatment, but were considered grade 5 events by the investigator."
" a medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. a total of 7 participants had serious medical problems: 3% (2 out of 75) of participants in the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group, 3% (2 out of 72) of participants in the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group, and 4% (3 out of 72) of participants in the placebo group had serious medical problems. there was 1 participant who received placebo and died during the study due to epilepsy. the study doctor said that the death was not related to the study medicines. "," in the overall population, the most frequently reported aes (reported in at least 10% of subjects) were as follows: for pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day, dizziness (13 [17.3%] subjects); for pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group, dizziness (12 [16.7%] subjects) and headache and somnolence (11 [15.3%] subjects each); and for placebo, headache (12 [16.7%]). in subjects 5 to 16 years of age, the most frequently reported aes (reported in at least 10% of subjects) in the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group were dizziness (4 [15.4%] subjects) and upper respiratory tract infection (3 [11.5%] subjects). no aes occurred in at least 10% of subjects aged 5 to 16 years within the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group, with the incidence of headache, somnolence, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight increased reported in 2 (9.1%) subjects each. one subject in the placebo group discontinued the study due to death from sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (sudep), which the investigator considered not related to study treatment. one additional subject in the placebo group discontinued the study due to pregnancy. an additional 15 subjects discontinued the study due to an ae (8 subjects in the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group, 5 subjects in the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group, and 2 subjects in the placebo group). the majority of aes leading to discontinuation were in the nervous system disorders system organ class (soc) (12 of 17 subjects in total), of which most were due to a seizure- or epilepsy-related event. a total of 15 subjects 17 to 65 years of age permanently discontinued due to aes, as did 2 subjects 5 to 16 years of age. in addition to the subject that died, other treatment-emergent serious aes (saes) were reported in 6 subjects, 2 in each treatment group; seizure (2 subjects) in the placebo group, status epilepticus and generalised tonic-clonic seizure in the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group, and generalised clonic tonic seizure (2 subjects) in the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group. the proportion of subjects with aes relating to laboratory parameters was low with none severe or considered to be saes. conclusion(s): in this study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjunctive pregabalin administered bid in subjects 5 to 65 years of age with pgtc seizures:  the primary objective was not met with pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day based on statistically non-significant reduction in pgtc seizure frequency compared to placebo.  the primary endpoint analysis for the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group compared to placebo was non-significant per the pre-specified sequential step-wise testing procedure.  pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day and pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day were generally safe and well tolerated and consistent with the well-established safety profile of pregabalin."
