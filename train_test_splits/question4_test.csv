"," ae data summaries included ae data captured in the crf until the end of study or the start of new systemic anticancer therapy for those patients who received new systemic anticancer therapy. the duration of study treatment was longer in the crizotinib group (median 67.8 weeks) than in the chemotherapy group (median 18.4 weeks). the ae analyses presented below were not adjusted for the longer duration of study treatment for the crizotinib group compared with the chemotherapy group. adverse events (aes) the treatment-emergent non-serious aes reported in 5% of subjects in any of the treatment group by preferred term and by system organ class (all causality and treatment-related) are summarized in table 10. overall, 102 (98.08%) subjects in the crizotinib group and 100 (99.01%) subjects in the chemotherapy group experienced all causality treatment-emergent, non-serious aes. meaningfully different incidences of all-causality non-serious aes were considered to be those that were reported with an incidence of 10% of subjects in either treatment group and had a 5% absolute difference between treatment groups. all causality non-serious aes of diarrhoea, visual impairment, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, oedema peripheral, headache, pain in extremity, dizziness, nasopharyngitis, sinus bradycardia, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, and vision blurred were reported with a meaningfully higher frequency in the crizotinib group than in the chemotherapy group. all causality non-serious aes of anaemia, neutropenia, platelet count decreased, haemoglobin decreased, white blood cell count decreased and hyponatraemia were reported with a meaningfully higher frequency in the chemotherapy group than in the crizotinib group. serious adverse events (saes) saes by preferred term and by system organ class (all-causality and treatment-related) are summarized in table 11. all-causality saes were reported for 34 (32.69%) subjects in the crizotinib group and 13 (12.87%) subjects in the chemotherapy group. any treatment-related saes were reported in a total of 6 (5.77%) subjects in the crizotinib group and 3 (2.97%) subjects in the chemotherapy group. subjects having more than 1 ae preferred term within a clustered term contributed 1 event to the clustered term at the highest grade observed. aes associated with permanent discontinuation of study treatment regardless of causality by preferred term and clustered term (capital letters) are summarized in table 12. the percentages of subjects with all-causality aes associated with permanent discontinuation from study treatment were reported for 19 (18.3%) crizotinib-treated subjects and 4 (4.0%) chemotherapy-treated subjects. included in the total are 2 crizotinib-treated subjects and 1 chemotherapy-treated subject, whose deaths occurred >28 days after the last dose of study treatment, but were considered grade 5 events by the investigator. there was no grade 5 all-causality ae reported in more than 1 chemotherapy-treated subject."
