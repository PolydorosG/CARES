" this study was for children who were diagnosed with invasive candida infection, or who were at high risk for getting an invasive candida infection. the children in this study were at least 1 month old, but younger than 18 years old when the study started. first, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit for the study. this was called screening. the children were grouped by age:  group 1 (19 children): at least 1 month old, but younger than 2 years old  group 2 (19 children): at least 2 years old, but younger than 5 years old  group 3 (30 children): at least 5 years old, but younger than 18 years old all the children in this study were given anidulafungin by iv (a needle in the vein), and the doses were based on each childs weight. on the first day of treatment, children were given 3 milligrams (mg) of anidulafungin per kilogram (kg) of weight. from the second day of treatment onwards, children were given 1.5 mg of anidulafungin per kg of weight. children were supposed to receive anidulafungin for at least 10 days if they had a candida infection and at least 5 days if they were at high risk of getting a candida infection. after the anidulafungin treatment, the study doctor may have decided to switch some of the children to another antifungal medicine called fluconazole, given by mouth, to continue treatment of the candida infection. all children could receive up to 35 days of anidulafungin and up to 49 days of total treatment (anidulafungin + fluconazole). this was an open-label study, which means that the researchers, the children, and the childrens parents/caregivers knew which medicines were being given. safety was carefully considered throughout the study. the study doctors examined each child, did blood/urine tests, and watched for any medical problems. the study doctors also followed up with the children for 6 weeks after their last dose of study treatment. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. while children were only in the study for up to 13 weeks (treatment plus follow-up), the entire study took about 9 years to complete. children joined the study at 1 of 26 locations in 10 countries (brazil, canada, greece, italy, republic of korea, russia, spain, taiwan, united kingdom, and united states). the first child joined the study on 27 february 2009 and the last child finished the study on 14 february 2018. a total of 30 girls and 38 boys joined the study. patients were supposed to receive study treatment for up to 35 days and come to 2 follow-up visits at week 2 and week 6 of the study. of the 68 children who started the study, 58 children (85%) completed it. ten (10) children (15%) did not finish the study by their choice or because they passed away. the study doctors determined that none of these deaths were related to the study treatment. when the study ended in february 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN This prospective, open-label, non-comparative study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of anidulafungin when used to treat children between the ages of 1 month and <18 years with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC). Should the investigator choose to withdraw the subject from study treatment, the subject will discontinue study treatment but will remain in the study for continued safety monitoring for up to 6 weeks after the last dose of study treatment. In order to accelerate the availability of PK and safety data in the lowest age group (1 month to < 2 years), the study population is broadened only in this age group to include children at risk for invasive candidiasis. Thus, eligibility criteria have been modified in Amendment 9 to microbiologically confirmed Candida but who are at high risk of candidiasis, and for whom the investigator considers antifungal therapy with at least 5 days of IV anidulafungin to be appropriate. Enrollment will be stratified by age (1 month - <2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 - <18 years), allowing 20  2 in each stratum. Subjects with microbiologically confirmed ICC may be switched to oral fluconazole (6-12 mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) after at least 10 days of IV anidulafungin treatment, provided that all of the following criteria are met:  The subject is afebrile for at least 24 hours;  The subject is able to tolerate oral medication;  Documentation of two blood cultures negative for Candida spp separated by at least 24 hours;  Eradication or presumed eradication of Candida sp. Subjects will receive treatment (either solely IV anidulafungin, or anidulafungin followed by oral fluconazole) for a minimum duration of 14 days from the time of the last of negative culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by at least 24 hours, following the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of candidemia or invasive candidiasis. In subjects with Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomyelitis who require continued treatment beyond the maximum total treatment duration (49 days), this treatment will be considered outside the context of this clinical trial and study drug will not be supplied by the Sponsor. For the purpose of study treatment evaluation, Day 35 (for subjects who require continued IV treatment) or Day 49 (for subjects who required continued oral therapy) will be considered the last day of study drug treatment. These subjects are also required to return for the 2-week and 6-week follow-up visit following the last dose of study drug. All subjects enrolled in the study who receive at least one dose of study drug treatment, including those subjects who are discontinued from treatment (regardless of the reason), will be followed for a total of 6 weeks after EOT (ie, the last dose of study drug treatment) and are required to return for the 2-week and 6-week follow-up visit. All subjects will have the following assessments at the screening visit: physical examination, assessment of signs and symptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen culture or histopathology of other normally sterile sites (as clinically indicated), and safety laboratory testing. At selected investigator sites, anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 6 subjects between 1 month to <2 years of age to confirm whether or not the recommended dosing regimen contained within the protocol for this age group is appropriate. If the investigator chooses to administer anidulafungin as monotherapy for the treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia, then treatment will be administered for a minimum duration of 14 days from the time of the last negative culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by at least 24 hours, following the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptom of candidemia or invasive candidiasis. In the event the investigator choses to administer anidulafungin in combination with a second antifungal agent, anidulafungin will be discontinued following the obtainment of required blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis as specified by the protocol; the data from these subjects will not be utilized for secondary efficacy endpoint analyses but will be assessed for safety. At high risk for candidiasis (subjects 1 month to < 2 years of age only): Subject is at high risk for candidiasis and antifungal therapy with anidulafungin for a minimum of 5 days is considered appropriate by the investigator. from a bone biopsy or aspirate and evidence of osteomyelitis on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study; AND at the one of the following clinical criteria within 96 hours prior to study entry:  Fever, defined as an oral/tympanic temperature 100.4F (38.0C), rectal temperature 101.4F (38.6C) or an axillary temperature 99.4F (37.4C);  Hypothermia, defined as a temperature less than 96.8F (36.0C);  Hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 100% for age and gender norms (per National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) Working Group on Children and Adolescents guidelines);7  Other signs or symptoms of ICC, which may include the following: feeding intolerance, bloody stools, abdominal distension, thrombocytopenia, lethargy, color change, hyperglycemia, glycosuria, unexplained metabolic acidosis.  Continue treatment for a minimum of 14 days from the  Subjects may switch to oral fluconazole (6  12 time of the last negative culture (defined as the second of mg/kg/day, maximum 800 mg/day) after a minimum of 5 two consecutive negative cultures, separated by at least days of IV therapy."
" this study followed 31 patients for up to 10 years to see what medical problems they had while taking tafamidis. this was an open-label study, which means that the patients and researchers knew that the patients were taking tafamidis. all patients took 20 mg of tafamidis by mouth once daily. the study included men and women with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy who had completed study fx1b-201 and had not received a heart or liver transplant. a diagram of the study is shown below. patients could have been in the study for up to 10 years. the entire study took 10 years and 2 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 5 locations in the united states. it began on 22 september 2009 and ended on 20 november 2019. twenty-eight (28) men and 3 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 69 and 88. patients were to be treated until the end of the study, or until the patient withdrew from the study or passed away. of the 31 patients who started the study, 2 finished 10 years of study treatment. twenty-nine (29) patients did not finish the study. nineteen (19) patients did not finish the study because they passed away. eight (8) patients left before the study was over by their choice, and 2 patients left because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. when the study ended in november 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, open-label study designed to obtain additional, long-term, open-label safety and efficacy data for tafamidis, and to continue to provide subjects who have completed Protocol Fx1B-201 (a Phase 2, open-label study to evaluate TTR stabilization, as well as the safety and tolerability of tafamidis) with 20 mg oral tafamidis (soft gelatin capsule) for up to 10 years or until subject has access to tafamadis for TTR-CM via prescription. Upon regulatory approval for the treatment of TTR-CM in their respective country and access to prescription tafamadis, subjects may be withdrawn from the study. Such subjects will be considered study completers. The decision to withdraw subjects to transition to commercial tafamidis will be done in consultation between the investigator and the sponsor (see section 6.3). Subjects who successfully complete Protocol Fx1B-201 will be eligible to enter study Fx1B-303. 3.1. Rationale for Study Design and Control Group This is an open-label study designed to obtain additional safety and efficacy data and to continue to provide tafamidis to subjects with TTR-CM who have not had a liver or heart transplant and who have completed Protocol Fx1B-201. A control group will not be included in this open-label study design. 3.2. Study Duration and Dates Enrolled subjects will receive 20 mg tafamidis (soft gelatin capsules) for up to 10 years or until subject has access to tafamadis for TTR-CM via prescription. Upon regulatory approval for the treatment of TTR-CM in their respective country and access to prescription tafamadis, subjects may be withdrawn from the study. The decision to withdraw subjects to transition to commercial tafamidis will be done in consultation between the investigator and the sponsor (see section 6.3)."
" this study was done to learn more about the use of dalteparin in children who have a type of cancer. first, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit for the study. this was called screening. the children were grouped by age:  group 1 (1 child): 0 weeks old to less than 8 weeks old  group 2 (2 children): at least 8 weeks old, but less than 2 years old  group 3 (8 children): at least 2 years old, but less than 8 years old  group 4 (7 children): at least 8 years old, but less than 12 years old  group 5 (20 children): at least 12 years old, but less than 19 years old this was an open label study, which means that the children, their parents/guardians, and the study doctors knew which medicine the children received during the study. in this study, all children received dalteparin. there were 3 phases to this study. phase 1 was known as the dose adjustment phase. this phase started when the child received their first (starting) dose of study medicine and continued for up to 7 days. the starting dose depended on the age and weight of the child, as follows:  group 1: 125 iu per kilogram (kg) of weight  group 2: 150 iu per kg of weight  group 3: 125 iu per kg of weight  group 4: 125 iu per kg of weight  group 5: 100 iu per kg of weight then, during this 7-day dose adjustment phase, the study doctors tested the childs anti-xa levels. each childs dalteparin dose was adjusted (upward or downward), as needed, until the childs anti-xa test result was between 0.5 and 1.0 (the target range). the dose that put the childs anti-xa level into that target range is called the maintenance dose. this is the dose that would be used going forward, in order to keep the childs anti-xa level within the target range. study. phase 2 was known as the pharmacodynamics phase, and it lasted between 1 and 7 days (enough time to collect 2 blood samples from each child). during this time, children received their maintenance dose from phase 1, given every 12 hours. after they completed phase 2, the children entered phase 3 of the study. phase 3 was known as the follow-up phase, and it lasted until the end of the study. the children continued receiving their maintenance dose of dalteparin, given every 12 hours. the study doctors tested the childrens blood to make sure anti-xa was still within the target range (0.5 to 1.0). the figure below shows what happened during this study. while children were only in the study for up to 90 days, the entire study took almost 9 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in norway, russia, slovenia, spain, and the united states. it began 20 august 2009 and finished 20 march 2018. a total of 14 girls and 24 boys participated all children were between the ages of 0 and 18 years old. the study required the children to come to a total of 7 visits at the study center. of the 38 children who were treated in the study, 26 children (68%) completed all of the study visits. at total of 12 children (32%) did not finish the study, either due to medical problems or by their parent/guardians choice. when the study ended in march 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Overall Study Design and Plan  Description The study is a 3-month prospective, multicenter, open-label cohort study in North America and Europe to determine twice daily dosing recommendations of dalteparin as a function of age in order to achieve Anti-Xa levels of 0.5 to 1.0 IU/mL at 4 hour ( 1 hour) post-dose in children with or without various cancers and requiring anticoagulation for the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of VTE. The study is divided into 3 phases: 1) Dose Adjustment Phase of up to 7 days; 2) PD Phase; and 3) Follow-Up Phase, to complete up to 90 days of treatment for cancer patients and treatment of non-cancer patients should be aligned with the 2012 ACCP Guidelines15 which suggest a total duration of anticoagulation treatment of between 6 weeks and 3 months rather than shorter or longer durations (Grade 2C), following completion of the PD Phase. Non-cancer patients will be required to remain in the study, however, for the full 3 months to complete all remaining study visits, regardless of dalteparin treatment duration. Schematic Trial Design Visit 1 Visit 2 Visit 3 Visit 4 Visits 5, 6 & 7/End of Treatment/ET Screening Baseline Dose PD Phase Follow-up (Day -3 ( Day 1) Adjustment (Day 2 or 3 (Days 15- 104) to -1) (Day 1 up to 14) to 7) This is a multi-center open-label study with no control group. This Phase II PD study is intended to provide information to guide the conditions under which dalteparin may be used for the treatment of acute and secondary prophylaxis of VTE in children with or without cancer. Subjects will be enrolled into the following five age groups:  0 to < 8 Weeks;  8 Weeks to < 2 Years;  2 Years to < 8 Years;  8 Years to < 12 Years;  12 Years to < 19 Years. Dose Adjustment Phase: The Dose Adjustment Phase will begin following the first dose and continue for up to 7 days. The starting doses for the five age groups are as follows:  0 to <8 weeks  125 IU/kg;  8 weeks to < 2 years 150 IU/kg;  2 years to <8 years  125 IU/kg;  8 years to <12 years  125 IU/kg and  12 years to <19 years  100 IU/kg. The first Anti-Xa plasma sample drawn after the initial dose of study drug treatment should be conducted 4 hours 1 hour after the first, second or third dose of study medication per Investigator judgment. Subsequent Anti-Xa plasma samples conducted following dose adjustments will also be drawn at 4 hours 1 hour post-dose, after the first, second or third dose of study medication per Investigator judgment. Doses will be adjusted in increments or decrements of 25 IU/kg in order to achieve target anti-Xa levels (0.5-1.0 IU/mL). Plasma samples drawn during the Dose-Adjustment Phase and Follow-Up Phase that deviate outside the 4  1 hr window cannot use the anti-Xa reference range, 0.5-1.0 IU/mL, and should be repeated the next day for both central and local labs. Dalteparin sodium will be administered subcutaneously every 12 hours 1 hour (no less than 8 hours (no less than 8 hours between doses) and record the actual dosing time. Subjects from each age group will be randomized according to a randomization scheme provided by the electronic system, IMPALA, into two different plasma sampling windows: 1 to 3 h and 5 to 8 h or 3 to 5 h and 8 to 12 h until at least 50 subjects provide viable PD Phase Anti-Xa values. All plasma samples should be drawn within the assigned window at each visit, however, if this is not possible, record the actual time the plasma sample is drawn in the Case Report Form (CRF) and repeat it when appropriate at the correct time, if possible. During this phase, dalteparin sodium will be administered subcutaneously every 12 hours 1 hour (no less than 8 hours between doses) with the maintenance therapeutic dose at Visits 5, 6 and 7. One Anti-Xa plasma sample will be collected at 4 hours 1 hour post-dose at each visit to check if the Anti-Xa level remains within the target therapeutic range. Plasma samples drawn during the follow up phase that deviate outside the 4  1 hr window cannot use the Anti-Xa reference range, 0.5-1.0, and should be repeated the next day for both central and local labs. For non-cancer patients, between 6 weeks and 3 months, rather than shorter or longer durations (Grade 2C), following completion of the PD Phase (2012 ACCP Guidelines15) due to: 1) new or recurrent VTE; 2) bleeding necessitating permanent discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy; 3) unexpected permanent discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy; 4) AEs Non-cancer patients will be required to remain in the study, however, for the full 3 months, regardless of dalteparin treatment duration.

The contact center phone number can also be used by investigational staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should only be used in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team are not available."
" how was the study done? participants in this study had previously been in study b1801014 for approximately 96 weeks and treated with at least 1 dose of etanercept. participants who joined this study could be given further etanercept treatment and all were observed for up to an additional 8 years. the study participants and researchers knew that everyone in the study had taken etanercept. this is known as an open label study. the researchers did this study to find out about the long-term safety of etanercept in children and adolescents. a when the researchers looked for medical problems, they used data they had collected from the 127participants in study b1801014 as well as the data they had collected from the 109 participants who continued etanercept treatment or were observed in study b1801023. b participants treated with etanercept could temporarily stop treatment or restart etanercept throughout the study. if the participant permanently stopped etanercept treatment, they were observed and could not restart etanercept treatment. c the number of participants who left the study were cumulative, which means they were added together so 9 participants left at 2 years and a further 10 participantsleft at 4 years giving the total who left up to 4years as 19, etc. d there were 2 participants whostopped etanercept treatment before 4 years, but these 2 participants were not included in the temporarily stopped etanercept, the restarted etanercept, or the observation and no etanercept groups. the total number of participants in these groups who were still in the study at 4years was 88 and with the 19 participants who left the study, the total was 107 participants rather than the usual 109participants included at 2, 6, and 8 years. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 36 locations in 19 countries in europe, the russian federation, colombia, mexico, and australia. when did this study take place? it began 10 october 2011 and ended 04 february 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who were children or adolescents with eojia, era, or psa.  a total of 48 boys and young men participated.  a total of 61 girls and young women participated.  all participants were between the ages of 4 and 19 years. in study b1801014, there were 127 participants who had been in the study for approximately 96 weeks and who had received at least 1 dose of etanercept. of these participants, 109 entered study b1801023 and 18 chose not to enter this long-term study. the participants who entered this long-term study could be treated with etanercept or were regularly assessed for safety for up to an additional 8 years. there were 99 participants who were treated with etanercept and 10 participants who were not treated with etanercept, but who were followed for safety monitoring in this long- term study. of the 109 participants who started this study, 84 finished the study. there were 25 participants who did not finish the study. these participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. how long did the study last? study participants were in this study for up to 10 years (up to 2 years in study b1801014 and up to 8 years in study b1801023). the entire study took up to 10 years to complete. when the study ended in february 2021, the sponsor began reviewing all the information collected. the sponsor then created a final report of the results. this is a summary of that final report. "," STUDY DESIGN This is an open-label, single treatment, multi-center, 8-year extension study in pediatric subjects who have been diagnosed with one of 3 subtypes of JIA (extended oligoarticular JIA, ERA, or PsA), have received at least one dose of etanercept and completed approximately 96 weeks of participation in study 0881A1-3338. These subjects will be It is anticipated that approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled in study B1801023. This 96-month study contains 3 periods: an active treatment period, a withdrawal/re-treatment period, and an observational period. Active treatment period:  Subjects who completed approximately 96 weeks of active treatment with investigational product (etanercept) in study 0881A1-3338 and are eligible to continue investigational product in study B1801023 will enter directly into the active treatment period. These subjects may continue to receive investigational product for up to 8 additional years (96 months). Withdrawal/Re-treatment period:  Withdrawal: Subjects who have either completed approximately 96 weeks of treatment in study 0881A-3338 or were enrolled in the active treatment period of study B1801023 and who have either met the Wallace definition for clinically inactive disease for at least 6 months on investigational product (etanercept) or who, in the investigators judgment, have had a good clinical response and would benefit from withdrawal from investigational product and are otherwise eligible can enter the withdrawal/re-treatment period. However, the withdrawal/re-treatment period is optional and it is ultimately up to the investigator and subject to determine when the subject should be withdrawn from treatment.  Re-treatment: Subjects requiring re-treatment per the investigators clinical judgment and who are otherwise eligible will be offered the option to re-start treatment with investigational product. Subjects may not enter the withdrawal/re-treatment period more than once during the study. Observational period: All subjects will be followed for a total of 8 years from the time of initial entry into the study as follows:  Subjects who discontinued investigational product prior to completing 96 weeks of active treatment in study 0881A1-3338 for any reason or who are not eligible to continue investigational product in study B1801023 will not be permitted to re-start investigational product in study B1801023 and will be asked to enter the observational period.  Subjects who participate in the active treatment period of study B1801023 and subsequently discontinue use of investigational product at any time before completion of the study and do not participate in the withdrawal/re-treatment period for any reason (i.e., ineligible or subject declined participation) will be asked to participate in the observational period.  Subjects who participate in the withdrawal period and are ineligible for re-treatment with investigational product for any reason will be asked to participate in the observational period.  Subjects who participate in the re-treatment period and subsequently discontinue investigational product prior to the completion of the study will be asked to participate in the observational period. Once a subject enters into the observational period, he or she cannot resume investigational product for the remaining time in the study. Subjects participating in the observational period of study B1801023 may receive standard of care including any anti-TNF agents (eg, commercial etanercept) and/or other immunosuppressive biologic agents for treatment of their disease at the discretion of the investigator."
" this study evaluated a group of participants to learn more about the safety of pregabalin. the study included participants between the ages of 1 month and 16 years who were diagnosed with epilepsy with partial onset seizures, and participants between the ages of 5 years and 65 years who were diagnosed with epilepsy with pgtc seizures. some of these participants had participated in a previous study with pregabalin, and all participants were already taking 1 to 3 other treatments for epilepsy (antiepileptic drugs to help prevent seizures) in addition to pregabalin. participants continued to take their other antiepileptic drugs during the study. this was an open-label study, which means that the participants and the researchers knew which treatments and doses they received during the study. pregabalin was divided into 2 or 3 daily doses and taken by mouth, either as tablets or a liquid, for approximately 1 year. for participants between 1 month and 16 years old, the beginning pregabalin dose was based on weight:  2.5 milligrams (mg) for each kilogram (kg) of body weight per day, for participants who weigh 30 kg (66 pounds) or more  3.5 milligrams for each kilogram of body weight per day, for participants who weigh less than 30 kg (66 pounds) for participants 17 years and older, the beginning pregabalin dose was a total of 150 mg per day, divided into 2 daily doses of 75 mg. the study doctor may have adjusted these doses, as needed, but study participants did not receive more than 600 mg of pregabalin per day. participants were asked to attend 9 visits at the study center, and were contacted by phone at least once per month. participants (or their parents) were also asked to record any seizures in a diary. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. the sponsor ran this study at 142 locations in 31 countries in asia, europe, and north america. it began 21 february 2012 and ended 22 august 2019. a total of 319 (53%) males and 286 (47%) females participated. 491 (81%) participants were 16 years or younger, and 114 (19%) participants were 17 years or older. a total of 76% (462 of 605) of the participants who started the study, finished. a total of 24% (142 of 605) of the participants left before the study was over by their choice, a doctor decided it was best that they stop the study, or they passed away for a reason not caused by taking pregabalin. additionally, 1 (less than 1%) participant left the study safely, but further information could not be reported due to an issue with the approval required by local healthcare authorities. when the study ended in august 2019, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN Study A0081106 is a 12 month, open-label, flexible dose, multicenter study to evaluate the tolerability and safety of pregabalin (administered BID in subjects 4 years of age and TID in subjects <4 years of age) as adjunctive therapy in pediatric subjects 1 month to 16 years of age with partial onset seizures and pediatric and adult subjects 5 to 65 years of age with (PGTC) seizures. For subjects who have participated in, but did not complete Studies A0081041, A0081042, or A0081105, eligibility for Study A0081106 will be considered, after consultation with Study Clinician, on a case by case basis. A minimum of 4 weeks in the double-blind treatment phase of either Study A0081041 or Study A0081105 will be required for consideration of enrollment into Study A0081106. Selected sites (within the United States only) that are not participating in studies A0081041 or A0081042 may screen and enroll pediatric subjects (1 month to 16 years of age) with partial onset seizures directly into Study A0081106 provided they meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. When subject enrollment for Studies A0081041 and A0081042 is complete, sites that were enrolling subjects in Studies A0081041 or A0081042 may screen and enroll pediatric subjects (1 month to 16 years of age) with partial onset seizures directly into Study A0081106 until enrollment into Study A0081106 is closed by Pfizer. Treatments and Visits The day of the last visit (completion of taper phase) of Studies A0081041, A0081042, and A0081105 is designated as Day 1 (Visit 1A) of this study. For subjects directly entering Study A0081106 without participation in one of the studies above, baseline values for analysis of change in safety endpoints will be the assessments made at the first visit (Screening Visit 1B) of this study. For pediatric subjects, pregabalin dosing will initiate at the daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (subjects 30 kg) or 3.5 mg/kg/day (subjects <30 kg) at this visit. All seizures experienced will be self-recorded by the subject or recorded by their parents/legally acceptable representative as appropriate, in a daily seizure diary beginning at Visit 1 and subsequently throughout the entire study. Subjects will return for the designated assessments of safety, tolerability, and drug accountability at Week 1 (Visit 2), Month 1 (Visit 3), Month 2 (Visit 4), Month 4 (Visit 5), Month 6 (Visit 6), Month 9 (Visit 7), Month 12/Early Termination (Visit 8), and Follow-up (Visit 9). Investigator site staff will contact the subject and/or parent/caregiver by telephone at least monthly between visits, to address questions, assess safety and adverse events, and ensure compliance with study directives. At Visit 2 and subsequent visits thereafter, the investigator or designee will review seizure diary data and tolerability with the subject and may adjust the dose at his/her discretion. For pediatric subjects with body weight 30 kg (1 month to 16 years of age), doses may remain the same or be adjusted upward in increments of no more than 2.5 mg/kg/day to daily dose levels of 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0 mg/kg/day. For pediatric subjects with body weight <30 kg, doses may be adjusted in increments of no more than 3.5 mg/kg/day to daily dose levels of 7.0, 10.5, or 14.0 mg/kg/day. For adult subjects (17 to 65 years of age) doses may be adjusted in increments of 150 mg/day to daily dose levels of 300, 450, or 600 mg/day.

" how was the study done? participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. participants who were a good fit were assigned to receive either tofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) or tofacitinib 10 mg twice per day by mouth, depending on whether they had uc symptoms when this study started. participants with no symptoms (known as being in remission) received tofacitinib 5 mg, and participants with symptoms received tofacitinib 10 mg. the dose could be adjusted during the study, if needed. this was an open-label study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose they received. participants were expected to attend visits at the study center every 3 months, and complete a 4-week follow-up period after they finished study treatment. the figure below shows what happened during this study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 298 locations in 31 countries in africa, asia, australia/new zealand, europe, north america, and south america. when did this study take place? it began on 1 october 2012 and ended on 6 august 2020. who participated in this study? this study included adult men and women who:  had moderate to severe uc  had participated in a previous study with tofacitinib  had not had surgery for uc and were not likely to need surgery for uc during the study  did not have other bowel diseases, such as crohns disease, infectious colitis, or colon cancer  a total of 555 men participated  a total of 389 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 18 and 81 participants could continue taking study treatment as long as they continued to benefit from it, or until the study ended. of the 944 participants who started the study and received treatment, 195 completed it. a total of 749 participants stopped taking study treatment early  by their choice,  because they did not see significant improvement in uc symptoms,  because they had a medical problem,  because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study,  because they switched to a different study,  or because tofacitinib became available by prescription in their country (japan) how long did the study last? the amount of time that each participant was in this study varied. the entire study took almost 8 years to complete. when the study ended in august 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. what medical problems did participants have during the study? the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. 780 out of 944 (83%) participants in this study had at least 1 medical problem.  154 out of 175 (88%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg had a medical problem.  626 out of 769 (81%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg had a medical problem. a total of 196 out of 944 (21%) participants left the study because of medical problems.  30 out of 175 (17%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg left the study because of a medical problem.  166 out of 769 (22%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg left the study because of a medical problem. the most common medical problems  those reported by at least 10% of participants  are described below. below are instructions on how to read table 1. instructions for understanding table 1.  the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all medical problems reported by at least 10% of participants are listed.  the 2nd column tells how many of the 175 participants taking tofacitinib 5 mg reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 175 participants taking tofacitinib 5 mg who reported the medical problem.  the 3rd column tells how many of the 769 participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 769 participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg who reported the medical problem.  using these instructions, you can see that 41 out of the 175 (23%) participants taking tofacitinib reported a common cold. a total of 157 out of 769 (20%) participants taking tofacitinib 10 mg reported common cold. did study participants have any serious medical problems? a medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 186 out of 944 (20%) participants in this study had at least 1 serious medical problem.  38 out of 175 (22%) participants who received tofacitinib 5 mg had serious medical problems  148 out of 769 (19%) participants who received tofacitinib 10 mg had serious medical problems a total of 6 participants in the tofacitinib 10 mg group died during or following study treatment. the most common serious medical problems  those reported by at least 2% of participants  are described below. where can i learn more about this study?

The eligibility of a subject for this study will be assessed based on study data collected at Week 8/9 of Study A3921094 or A3921095 (for non-responders) or the Week 52/53 visit (for completers) or early termination visit (early withdrawals due to treatment failure) of Study A3921096. The study data collected at the Week 8/9 visit for Study A3921094 or A3921095 (for non-responders) or the Week 52/53 visit or early termination visit of Study A3921096 will be recorded as the baseline data for Study A3921139. Eligible subjects will be assigned to either tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID depending on whether the subject is in remission at baseline of Study A3921139. For treatment assignment at baseline, the central read assessment of the Mayo endoscopic subscore will be used to determine if a subject is in or who are early withdrawals due to treatment failure in Study A3921096 are eligible to receive tofacitinib 10 mg BID. Treatment failure is defined by an increase in Mayo score of at least 3 points from baseline value of the maintenance study (A3921096), accompanied by an increase in rectal bleeding subscore by at least 1 point, and an increase of endoscopic subscore of at least 1 point (yielding an absolute endoscopic subscore of 2) after a minimum of 8 weeks of treatment in the maintenance study. In the scenario where the endoscopic subscore is a 3, and the maintenance baseline endoscopic subscore is already a 3 (maximum value), then an increase by at least 1 point will not be needed in order to meet treatment failure. Tofacitinib dose can be adjusted from 5 mg BID to 10 mg BID for efficacy and from 10 mg BID to 5 mg BID after meeting specific laboratory abnormalities or other protocol defined criteria regarding efficacy (see Section 5.8 for dose adjustment guidelines). Subjects who enroll into this study who are on tofacitinib 10 mg BID for at least 2 consecutive years, and who are in stable remission on tofacitinib 10 mg BID for at least 6 months may have the opportunity to enter Study A3921288 (A Phase 3b/4, Multi-Center, Double-Blind, Randomized, Parallel Group Study of Tofacitinib in Subjects with UC in Stable Remission) if they meet the eligibility criteria. These subjects must:  Have received tofacitinib 10 mg BID for a minimum of 2 consecutive years in Study A3921139 (and not have their tofacitinib dose reduced to 5 mg BID due to safety or efficacy.  Be in stable remission on tofacitinib 10 mg BID for the 6 month period in Study A3921139 up to and including the baseline visit of Study A3921288, defined as meeting all of the following criteria:  A partial Mayo score 2, with no individual subscore >1 and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 at each study visit during the 6 month period in Study A3921139 prior to and at baseline of Study A3921288; AND  At least one assessment of remission based on Mayo score. Study A3921288 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in subjects in stable remission on 10 mg BID who decrease the dose to and remain on 5 mg BID compared to subjects who remain on 10 mg BID. Clinical response is defined by a decrease from the induction study baseline (A3921094 or A3921095) Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. All subjects who withdraw early or who complete this open-label study, with the exception of those subjects entering Study A3921288, will have a 4-week safety follow-up evaluation after the last dose of study medication. Subjects who enter this study on corticosteroids (eg, subjects who withdraw from Study A3921096 due to treatment failure or non-responders at the end of Study A3921094 or A3921095) will need to continue the steroid tapering regimen described in Study A3921096 (see Section 5.5). If a subject discontinues the use of background oral 5-ASA or sulfasalazine and/or has the therapy re-initiated during the study, this will not constitute rescue therapy, and the subject will be permitted to remain in the study.

These interim recommendations on the restrictions for prescriptions of tofacitinib state that patients who are at high risk of blood clots in the lungs must not be started on tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and that such patients currently taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID for any condition must be switched to alternative treatments. If a subject is identified as meeting any of the above criteria, they will be required to adjust their dose from 10 mg BID (administered as 2 x 5 mg tablets in the AM and 2 x 5 mg tablets in the PM) down to 5 mg BID (administered as 1 x 5 mg tablet in the AM and 1 x 5 mg tablet in the PM). The study investigator or designee will be required to ask each subject at each study visit if he/she has any newly-developed risk factors for pulmonary embolism, and if one is identified, the subject will not be permitted to receive tofacitinib 10 mg BID (see Section 7.3.12)."
" this study was done to find out if patients would have increased bladder capacity (be able to hold more urine) following 12 weeks of treatment with fesoterodine, compared to before they started taking study medicine. some of the patients were also compared to patients taking a medicine called oxybutynin xl. oxybutynin xl was selected to be the comparator medicine because it is widely used to treat ndo in children and adolescents. this study included children and adolescents who:  were aged 6 to 17 years  were diagnosed with ndo  had stable nervous system disease, which means that their nervous system disease was not getting worse  were checked by the study doctor for other health conditions, and were determined to be appropriate to join the study the study included 4 parts:  a run-in period before the study started. patients were screened by the study doctors to make sure they were a good fit to join the study. no study medicines were given during this period.  an efficacy phase for the first 12 weeks of study treatment, when the researchers evaluated how well fesoterodine works, along with its safety.  a safety extension phase for the last 12 weeks of study treatment, when the researchers continued to evaluate the safety of fesoterodine.  a 2-week follow-up phase at the end of the study. children and adolescents in this study were divided into 2 groups, based on weight:  group 1 (124 patients): patients weighing more than 25 kilograms (about 55 pounds)  group 2 (57 patients): patients weighing 25 kilograms or less patients from group 1 were assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments:  fesoterodine 4 milligram (mg) tablets (42 patients) for both the efficacy phase and safety extension phase (24 weeks)  fesoterodine 8 mg tablets (42 patients) for both the efficacy phase and safety extension phase (24 weeks)  oxybutynin xl tablets for the efficacy phase (12 weeks). these patients were then switched to fesoterodine 4 mg or 8 mg tablets for the safety extension phase (12 weeks) (40 patients). the patients were assigned to receive the treatments by chance alone, which is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups more similar. reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of boys and girls), makes the groups more even to compare. patients from group 2 were assigned by chance alone to receive 1 of 2 treatments for both the efficacy phase and safety extension phase (24 weeks):  fesoterodine 2 mg capsules (28 patients)  fesoterodine 4 mg capsules (29 patients) this was an open-label study, which means that the patients, their families, and the study doctors knew which medicine the patients were taking. patients were expected to come to 8 study visits they were checked by study doctors at each visit, to monitor for safety of the study medicines. bladder capacity was measured before the patients started study medicines, and again after they had been on the study medicines for 12 weeks. the figure below shows what happened during the study. patients were expected to be in this study for about 26 weeks (24 weeks of treatment plus a 2-week follow-up period). the sponsor ran this study at 102 locations in 28 countries in africa, asia, europe, and north america. the entire study took more than 7 years to complete. it began 2 july 2012 and ended 13 february 2020. a total of 95 boys (52%) and 86 girls (48%) participated in the study. all patients were between the ages of 6 and 17 years. patients were to be treated for 24 weeks. of the 124 patients in group 1 who started the study, 101 patients (81%) finished the study. of the 57 patients in group 2 who started the study, 48 patients (84%) finished the study. a total of 23 patients from group 1 (19%) and 9 patients from group 2 (16%) left before the study was over by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. when the study ended in february 2020, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN The study was designed to be in line with clinical practice and to minimize disruption, discomfort and inconvenience for subjects whilst maintaining scientific integrity. Cohort 1 (Subjects >25 kg) For this cohort this is a randomized, open label, active comparator parallel group study with three treatment arms. Note: The first week of the fesoterodine 8 mg group will be at a dose of 4 mg each day, for the active comparator phase and for those subjects changing from oxybutynin to the safety extension phase. The study consists of two parts: a 12 week three arm phase with an active comparator (oxybutynin XL), followed by a 12 week two arm extension phase without the active comparator. There is a variable screening period (minimum 3 days) prior to the baseline visit, the duration of which is principally determined by the prior medication subjects may need to washout (Appendix 3). At baseline, subjects will be randomized to one of three arms: 4 mg or 8 mg/day of fesoterodine or oxybutynin XL. Subjects will be randomized to each arm in a 1:1:1 ratio. After 12 weeks (or earlier if appropriate), subjects in the oxybutynin arm of the study will be allocated by the investigator to fesoterodine at either 4 mg or 8 mg/day. A sufficient number of subjects will be randomized into Cohort 1 to ensure a total of approximately 99 subjects (approximately 33 evaluable subjects per arm) are evaluable for the primary efficacy and safety analyses at Week 12, after which screening to Cohort 1 will be closed. Cohort 2 (Subjects 25 kg) Note: The first week of the fesoterodine 4 mg group will be at a dose of 2 mg each day, for the efficacy phase. For this cohort the study consists of two parts: a 12 week two arm efficacy phase, followed by a 12 week two arm safety extension phase. There is a variable screening period (minimum 3 days) prior to the baseline visit, the duration of which is principally determined by the prior medication subjects may need to washout (Appendix 3). At baseline, subjects will be randomized to one of two fesoterodine treatment arms: doses 2 mg and 4 mg/day). Subjects will be randomized to each arm in a 1:1 ratio. Once allocated subjects will remain on that dose for the 12 week efficacy phase, and will continue at the same dose during the 12 week safety extension phase. It is planned that a sufficient number of subjects will be randomized into this cohort to ensure a total of approximately 50 subjects (approximately 25 evaluable subjects per arm) are evaluable for the primary efficacy and safety analyses at Week 12, after which screening to Cohort 2 will be closed. The dosing of lighter subjects is dependent on the availability of an age-appropriate Beads- in-Capsule formulation. In the event that it is not possible to develop an age-appropriate formulation, then lighter subjects will not be dosed, and the end of the trial will be defined by the completion of the heavier >25 Kg cohort. 3.1. Study Visits  Randomization (Day 1, V2),  Week 4 (V3),  Week 12 (V5) and  Week 24 (V7). There will also be a minimum of 3 telephone calls (or clinic visits) to subjects to identify any new adverse events, review concomitant medication usage and the dosing log at:  Week 1  Week 8 (V4),  Week 18 (V6) and a further telephone call (or clinic visit) at:  Week 26 (V8). To review ongoing or new adverse events, review concomitant medications for subjects 2 weeks after completing study treatment. It will also be completed for all subjects who withdraw early from the study and take at least 1 dose of study medication. In addition, subjects >25 kg randomized to treatment with oxybutynin XL may receive a minimum of 3 contacts at approximately weekly intervals between V2 and V3 for dose adjustment to achieve a balance of efficacy and tolerability up to the maximum recommended dose. The contacts may be telephone calls or clinic visits as deemed appropriate by the investigator. Other contacts (for example, telephone calls or unscheduled clinic visits) may also be made, as appropriate, to verify study medication dose, and to provide reminders to the subject to complete the bladder diary and, if needed, daily dosing log. After the end of the trial, continued access to fesoterodine may be provided, if it is demonstrated that fesoterodine may provide a therapeutic benefit that cannot be obtained from available marketed treatments, and it is appropriate, feasible, and allowed according to SOPs and local regulations. In this case, fesoterodine will be provided until commercially available or 30 June 2017 or until subject discontinues such continued access treatment, whichever is earlier."
" this study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if patients with pphn or at risk of getting pphn who received an infusion of sildenafil compared with patients given placebo had:  a lower treatment failure rate, and  inhaled nitric oxide therapy for a shorter amount of time. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. treatment failure was said to have occurred if the patient needed additional treatment for their pphn or if they needed ecmo, or if the patient passed away. the study included patients who were 4 days old or younger and who had pphn or hrf and who were at risk of getting pphn. the pphn could be of no known cause or could be due to meconium aspiration syndrome (breathing in fecal matter produced by the baby while in the womb), sepsis (blood poisoning caused by bacteria) or pneumonia (infection in the lungs caused by bacteria or a virus). the patients and researchers did not know who was given sildenafil and who was given placebo. this is known as a blinded study. volunteers were assigned to each group by chance alone. this is done to make the groups more similar, which makes comparing the groups more fair. while patients were only in the main study for up to 6 weeks, this part of the study took over 5 and a half years to complete. follow-up is continuing for an additional 1 and 2 years and this phase of the study is ongoing .the sponsor ran this study at 25 locations in 11 countries in europe and north america. it began on 05 august 2013 and ended on 31 december 2019. a total of 33 boys and 26 girls participated. all patients were 4 days old or younger. patients were to be treated for up to 14 days. of the 59 patients who started the study, 46 finished the treatment phase. a total of 13 patients did not complete the treatment phase and this was their parents choice, because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study, or the patient passed away. some of the patients who left the study still took part in the follow-up. as of 31 january 2019 (the data cutoff date for the main report), the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a main report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN This study will be conducted in two parts. Part A is the double-blind phase and will be conducted during the acute phase of the disease, and consists of a screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase. Part B is the long-term, non-interventional phase, and consists Analysis of the double-blind phase of the study (Part A) will be performed and a clinical study report will be written when all subjects have completed or discontinued from the double-blind phase. Analysis of the non-interventional phase of the study (Part B) will be performed when all subjects have completed or discontinued from the 2-year follow-up visit, and a final study report will be written. Part A Figure 1. Study Design Part A This is the multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group part of the study with a screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase. Neonates with PPHN or HRF and at risk for PPHN who are receiving iNO treatment will be evaluated for the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 blinded, parallel arms of study drug treatment: IV sildenafil or IV placebo (1:1 ratio; 32 subjects per group). A 30-minute loading dose of study drug will be followed by the maintenance infusion. Should a serious or severe event of hypotension develop during the loading dose, per clinical judgment, the investigator has the option to reduce the infusion rate of the loading dose by 50%, or briefly stop the infusion for 15 minutes and then restart the loading dose at half the rate, for the rest of the loading dose. Study drug infusion must continue for at least 48 hours, and may continue for up to 14-days, with or without the administration of additional therapy for PPHN, such as alternative pulmonary vasodilator. (See Section 5.5 Concomitant Medication for a list of prohibited medication.) If maintaining study drug infusion for 48 hours is deemed by the investigator to compromise subject safety, the study drug infusion may be stopped, and the subject treated with standard care. Weaning from iNO, according to protocol-defined guidelines, must occur prior to stopping IV study drug, up to the 14-day infusion limit. After study drug discontinuation, the subject may be restarted within 24 hours if needed based on clinical decline, but not to exceed the 14-day infusion limit. All subjects will be followed up for medical status and adverse events at 7 and 28 days after the discontinuation of study drug. Dosing instructions including a chart of infusion rates by weight will be provided to the study pharmacists. The study drug infusion will start with a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg administered over 30 minutes. The loading dose is intended to bring the plasma concentration to the targeted level. Part B This long-term non-interventional phase of the study will evaluate the developmental progress of the subjects in the study at 12 and 24 months following the end of study treatment."
" this study compared 2 groups of children to learn more about the long-term effects of menacwy-tt. the sponsor asked children who participated in 2 previous studies on nimenrix to join this study. all the children were healthy and had received 2 injections (primary injection plus booster injection) of nimenrix or meningitec during the previous studies. the children did not receive any study vaccinations or other medicines during this study, since they had already received either nimenrix or meningitec during the previous studies. instead, the children were asked to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart, at the study center. during these visits, the researchers collected blood samples from the children. the researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of meningococcus germ. this was an open label study, which means that the children, their parents/guardians, and the researchers knew which vaccine the children received during the previous studies. the figure below shows what happened during this study. children were in this study for up to 4 years, and the entire study took a little more than 4 years to complete. children joined the study at 1 of 9 locations in finland. the first child joined the study on 16 july 2013 and the last child finished the study on 08 november 2017. a total of 84 girls and 100 boys joined the study. the children were between 7 and 10 years old when they began the study. children were supposed to come to up to 5 visits, each a year apart, at the study center. of the 184 children who joined the study, 174 (95%) completed it. a total of 10 children (5%) did not finish the study by their parent/guardians choice. when the study ended in november 2017, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

" this study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if patients taking talazoparib had more time without their cancer getting worse compared to patients taking other commonly used chemotherapies. the study included patients who:  were at least 18 years old  had breast cancer that was advanced or had spread to other parts of the body (also called metastatic cancer)  inherited the brca1 or brca2 gene mutation  did not have more than 3 chemotherapy treatments for their advanced cancer  had previously taken at least 1 of the commonly used cancer chemotherapies  had good organ function and adequate blood counts this trial was an open-label study. this means that both the patient and the doctor knew whether the patient received talazoparib or chemotherapy. patients joined the study at 1 of 145 locations in the us, europe (belgium, france, germany, ireland, italy, poland, spain, uk, israel, russia, and ukraine), brazil, south korea, australia, and taiwan. it began on 14 october 2013 and ended on 05 march 2021. a total of 7 men and 424 women participated in this study. all patients were between the ages of 24 and 88. patients were to be treated until their doctor determined that their cancer was getting worse, the side effects were too severe, or until they chose to stop participation in the study. all of the 431 patients who started the study had stopped treatment by the end of the study, mostly due to the patients cancer getting worse, the patient chose to stop, or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop their assigned treatment. the sponsor reviewed the study results in september 2017, september 2019, and march 2021. the sponsor then created reports of the results collected up to those time points. this is a summary of those reports. "," Tumor assessments are to be performed every 6 weeks ( 7 days) from the date of randomization for the initial 30 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter ( 7 days), regardless of any dose interruptions or dose delays until radiographic disease progression as determined by the IRF or initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy. 9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, parallel, 2-arm, multi-center study of talazoparib vs. protocol-specific physicians choice in germline BRCA mutation subjects with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer, who have received no more than 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced and/or metastatic disease. The subject population of germline BRCA mutation subjects with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer was chosen for this study as there is a current unmet need to treat this population and interim results from the Phase 1 study (PRP-001) indicated objective responses to talazoparib in 8 of 18 subjects, including one confirmed CR. The study drug will be administered until radiographic disease progression as determined by the IRF, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, subject or physician decision to stop treatment or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor. Documentation of a deleterious, suspected deleterious, or pathogenic germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation from Myriad Genetics or other laboratory approved by the Sponsor; for data obtained regarding a BRCA1/2 mutation from a non-Myriad laboratory, the pathology report must be submitted to and approved by the Sponsor and a blood sample sent to Myriad for analysis before randomization may occur ! A female of childbearing potential (defined in Section 9.7.4.6) must not be pregnant and must agree to avoid pregnancy during the study by using a highly effective birth control method (defined in Section 9.7.4.6) from the time of the first dose of study drug through 45 days after the last dose of study drug ! Female subjects who are breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant at any time during study participation through 45 days after the last dose of study drug; male subjects planning to impregnate a partner at any time during study participation through 105 days after the last dose of study drug ! Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of talazoparib 9.3.3 Removal of Subjects from Study or from Study Treatment Subjects should be encouraged to continue to provide study data until the primary outcome of radiographic disease progression as determined by the IRF or death has occurred. Subjects may be removed from study if considered by the Investigator or Sponsor to be in the best interest of the subject If a subject discontinues from treatment but remains on study, every effort should be made to continue the subjects assessments according to the schedule of assessments (Table 9-1) through the end of the study. The Investigator or designee must explain to each subject, before enrollment into the study, that for evaluation of study results, the subjects protected health information obtained during the study may be shared with the study Sponsor, regulatory agencies, and IRB/IEC/REB. Tumor assessments are to be performed every 6 weeks ( 7 days) from the date of randomization for the initial 30 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter ( 7 days), regardless of any dose interruptions or dose delays until radiographic disease progression as determined by the IRF or initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy. On days of clinic visits when PK samples are to be drawn, talazoparib should be taken at the clinic after completion of pre-dose sampling and assessments; on these PK sample dates, the clinic visit should be scheduled for approximately the same time of day that the dose is typically taken. 9.4.7.3 Liver Safety Test Monitoring and Assessments (Talazoparib or Protocol-Specific Physicians Choice Comparators) Subjects who develop abnormal liver tests (ie, AST, ALT, total bilirubin) and/or international normalized ratio [INR] values, and/or signs/symptoms of hepatitis during the study treatment (talazoparib or treatment of physicians choice) as specified in US FDA Guidance for Industry Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation (2009). No alternative cause explains the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities; important alternative causes include, but are not limited to: o Hepatobiliary tract disease o Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella, toxoplasmosis, parvovirus) o Congestive heart failure, hypotension, or any cause of hypoxia to the liver causing ischemia o Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary supplements, plants, and mushrooms o Alcoholic hepatitis o Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) o Autoimmune hepatitis o Wilsons disease and hemochromatosis o Alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency If an alternative cause for hepatotoxicity is identified or if the liver test abnormalities do not reach the specified severity, study drug should be withheld or permanently discontinued, as appropriate for the safety of the subject based on the patient population and/or severity of the hepatotoxicity or event. Any abnormal test results determined to be clinically significant by the Investigator should be repeated (at the Investigators discretion) until the cause of the abnormality is determined, the value returns to baseline or to within normal limits, or the Investigator determines that the abnormal value is no longer clinically significant. < 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for  12 months before randomization and with a postmenopausal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration > 30 IU/L (or meeting criteria for post-menopausal status by the local laboratory) Male Subjects Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must use a condom and contraception should be considered for the female partner from the time of the first dose of study drug through 105 days after the last dose of study drug."

The Phase 1 portion of the study will estimate the MTD for single-agent PF-06463922 in dose escalation cohorts in patients with advanced ALK+ or advanced ROS1+ NSCLC with or without asymptomatic CNS metastases, and will enroll approximately 36 patients (depending on toxicities observed). The Phase 2 will evaluate the anti-cancer activity of single-agent PF-06463922 in multiple subpopulations of patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC and patients with advanced ROS1+ NSCLC and will allow to better define the safety, PK and pharmacodynamic profiles of single-agent PF-06463922 at the RP2D.  EXP-3: Patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC with or without asymptomatic CNS metastases relapsing after crizotinib therapy and 1 or 2 prior regimens of chemotherapy given before or after crizotinib therapy OR patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC with or without asymptomatic CNS metastases relapsing after 1 ALK inhibitor therapy other than crizotinib with or without any number of prior chemotherapy regimens in any disease setting(as above, targeting 80 patients between EXP-2 and EXP-3 combined). The PF-06463922 starting dose in Phase 1 will be 10 mg. For each dose level in Phase 1, patients will be enrolled in cohorts of minimum 3 patients (unless 2 DLTs are observed in the first 2 patients tested at that dose level). Tumor assessments by computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) scans of Chest Abdomen Pelvis [CAP] and MRI of the brain will be performed at baseline, and the brain MRI and CAP will be repeated every 6 weeks 1 week on study for the first 18 months in Phase 1 and first 30 months in Phase 2, and then every 12 weeks 1 week beyond regardless of tumor involvement. For patients with bone involvement at Screening, CT or MRI or other appropriate imaging for bone assessment will be done every 6 weeks 1 week up to 18 months in Phase 1 and up to 30 months in Phase 2, and every 12 weeks  1 week thereafter (in addition to the every 12 week bone scan or bone MRI for detection of new disease) and responses will be confirmed 4 weeks later (RECIST v1.1) until documented progression of disease. Therefore, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06463922 in Japanese patients, this study will include a Japanese patient lead-in cohort (LIC) to evaluate PF-06463922 safety and PK of in Japanese patients treated at a previously tested dose in Phase 1. Patients who discontinue treatment before completing Cycle 1 (ie, the DLT observation period) or receive less than 16 of the planned 21 PF--06463922 doses for reasons other than treatment-related toxicity (eg, missed appointments, misplaced study drug supplies, development of coexisting medical condition rendering the patient unable to swallow medication, development of rapidly progressing disease) will be replaced for DLT evaluation but will remain in the overall safety and efficacy analyses.

The first 3 patients (ie, the first cohort) will be treated at 10 mg QD, and the following dose level explored will be 25 mg QD.To assign the dose level for each subsequent patient, the probability of DLT is estimated to a target rate 33%. Patients who discontinue treatment before completing Cycle 1 (ie, the DLT evaluation time window) or receive less than 16 of the planned 21 PF-06463922 doses for reasons other than treatment-related toxicity (eg, missed appointments, misplaced study drug supplies, development of coexisting medical condition rendering the patient unable to swallow medication, development of rapidly progressing disease) will be replaced for DLT evaluation but will remain in the overall safety and efficacy analyses. To avoid overly rapid escalation and to retain the efficiency of dose administration when enrollment is fast, the following restrictions will be applied:  For each dose level, patients will be enrolled in cohorts of minimum 3 patients (unless 2 DLTs are observed in the first 2 patients tested at that dose level). n/a: not applicable Intra-patient dose escalation may be permitted if all of the following conditions are satisfied:  Cycle 1 was completed without any DLT;  His/her maximum drug-related toxicity during prior cycles of therapy was Grade 2 and did not require a dose modification;  Observation of Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities not requiring dose modifications (as identified in Table 9) would be permitted;  Three patients at the next higher dose level have completed Cycle 1 with study drug without having a DLT. Dose administration (dose escalation and de-escalation) within the context of the CRM model of the Phase 1 portion of the trial stops if: (1) the maximum sample size has been reached (36 in total, see Section 9.3 for details), (2) at least 12 patients have been treated at a dose that is predicted to be the MTD or (3) all doses appear to be overly toxic and the MTD cannot be determined in the current trial."
" this study compared patients who received tafamidis with patients who received placebo, to understand if tafamidis helped patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being studied. this was a randomized trial, meaning patients were put randomly (by chance) into 1 of 3 groups:  group 1: received a study drug called tafamidis at a dose of 20 milligrams (mg)  group 2: received a study drug called tafamidis at a dose of 80 mg  group 3: received a placebo that didnt contain any drug putting patients into groups randomly makes comparing the groups more fair. the study included patients who had a history of heart failure due to transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. the patients and researchers did not know who took tafamidis and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. this means that neither the patients nor doctors knew which drug the patients actually got. the study began 09 december 2013 and ended 07 february 2018. while patients were in the study for 2.5 years (30 months), the entire study took about 4.5 years to complete. at the end of this study, all patients were offered the possibility to continue tafamidis treatment in a separate study to help researchers collect more data on the safety of tafamidis. the sponsor ran this study at 48 locations in 13 countries around the world. 398 men and 43 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 46 and 89. patients were to be treated for 30 months (2.5 years). of the 441 patients who started the study, 258 finished the study. 183 patients did not finish the study by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study, or because they died from causes not related to taking the study drug. when the study ended in february 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, multicenter, international, three-arm, parallel design, placebo-controlled, randomized study with a 30-month double-blind treatment phase, to determine efficacy, safety and tolerability of tafamidis on clinical outcomes in subjects with either transthyretin genetic variants or wild-type transthyretin resulting in amyloid cardiomyopathy (TTR-CM). There will be approximately 400 subjects enrolled in the study in a 2:1:2 ratio (placebo:20 mg:80 mg). The subjects will be allocated to the 3 arms of the study in the following manner: n=160 in the placebo arm, n=80 in the 20 mg arm, and n=160 in the 80 mg arm. Subjects who experience adverse events that may be associated with poor tolerability to treatment with tafamidis that may impact dosing adherence have the option of blinded treatment re-assignment and potential dose reduction (see Section 5.5). Subjects will be stratified during enrollment by TTR genotype (variant and wild-type) and structured such that greater than 30% of randomized subjects have a TTR mutation and greater than 30% of subjects have a diagnosis of wild-type TTR cardiomyopathy, with the intent to enroll comparable numbers between the variant and wild-type groups. Enrollment may be closed for either wild-type or variant stratum in order to enroll at least 30% of subjects with each TTR genotype (wild-type and variant). Additionally, stratification to treatment assignment will be done for Baseline severity of disease based on NYHA classification (NYHA Class I and NYHA Classes II and III combined). Stratification will be implemented in order to maintain a balance of both TTR genotype and disease severity across the treatment assignments. The site will ensure a Month 30 follow-up contact to determine the subjects vital status and whether the subject has had a heart and / or liver transplant or implantation of cardiac mechanical assist device. Upon completion of the study at the Month 30 visit, subjects may be eligible for -treatment with tafamidis in a separate extension study (B3461045), which will permit the collection of additional safety and efficacy data, and may include the assessment of hospitalizations, mortality, and other outcomes relating to disease progression. For the purpose of this study, 30 months is defined as 910 days. Eligibility for the extension study (B3461045) requires subject participation in this study at least through Day 896 (Month 30 minus 2 weeks)."
" this study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if patients taking enzalutamide went longer without their prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body or dying from any cause, compared to patients taking a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. the study included patients who:  were at least 18 years old,  were diagnosed with prostate cancer that had not spread to other parts of the body (also called non-metastatic),  were currently taking drugs that stop the testicles from making testosterone, or have had both testicles removed by surgery,  had prostate cancer that was getting worse, and  were not feeling any symptoms of prostate cancer (also called asymptomatic). the patients and researchers did not know who took enzalutamide and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups more similar, which makes comparing the groups more fair. twice as many patients were assigned to take enzalutamide compared to placebo. each patient in the study took either 160 mg of enzalutamide or placebo capsules by mouth once daily. patients who were taking drugs that stop the testicles from making testosterone continued to take these drugs during the study. the patients were checked every 16 weeks to see if their prostate cancer had started to spread. this was done by a bone scan (to check for cancer in the bones), followed by either a ct scan or an mri scan (to check for cancer in the rest of the body). the figure below shows what happened during the study. the sponsor ran this study at 254 locations in 32 countries in north and south america, europe, australia, and asia. it began on 26 november 2013 and is ongoing. a total of 1401 men participated in this trial. all patients were between the ages of 50 and 95. patients were to be treated until their prostate cancer got worse or until their doctor decided that they needed to start a different therapy for their prostate cancer. patients may also have stopped taking enzalutamide if they had a serious medical problem. of the 1401 patients who started the study, 1395 received at least 1 dose of enzalutamide or placebo. as of june 2017, 206 patients had left the study. a total of 41 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. when the study data was collected in june 2017, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the data collected up to that point in time. this is a summary of that report. data collected after june 2017 is not part of this report. "," Overall Study Design and Plan:Description This multinational, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety study will assess the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide versus placebo in approximately 1440 men with nonmetastatic CRPC at approximately 250 study centers. All patients will be required to maintain androgen deprivation during the study, either using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist/antagonist or having a history of bilateral orchiectomy. Central randomization to enzalutamide or placebo treatments (2:1) will be stratified by the following factors:  PSA doubling time (< 6 months vs 6 months);  Baseline use of a bone-targeting agent (yes vs no). Enzalutamide (160 mg/day) will be administered as four 40-mg soft gelatin capsules by mouth once daily with or without food. Placebo capsules, identical in appearance to enzalutamide capsules, will be administered to patients in the control arm in the same manner. Investigators are discouraged from obtaining PSA assessments at their local laboratories during the study and from discontinuing a patients study drug treatment due to PSA rise alone. Initiation of new therapy for prostate cancer (with the exception of cytotoxic chemotherapy, androgen receptor inhibitors, and investigational agents) at the time of radiographic progression will not mandate discontinuation of study drug if the investigator considers continuing study drug to be beneficial. Patients will continue with Enzalutamide after radiographic progression, if continuation of treatment with Enzalutamide seems clinically beneficial. Prostate cancer is a multiclonal disease, and a patient with confirmed disease progression may have other clones/foci that may benefit from continued treatment with study drug. In the ongoing, blinded, phase 3 PREVAIL study, approximately 34 of 1715 treated patients (2%) received study drug and antiandrogen or abiraterone after radiographic disease progression. Initiation of bisphosphonates or other bone-targeting agents for bone health, such as denosumab, is not allowed during the study prior to development of bone metastasis; however, treatment with these agents should continue if initiated at least 4 weeks before enrollment. The primary efficacy endpoint is MFS assessed by blinded independent central radiology review, defined as the time from randomization to radiographic progression or death on study (death within 112 days of treatment discontinuation without evidence of radiographic progression), whichever occurs first. Radiographic progression for bone disease is defined imaging modality (plain film, computed tomography [CT], or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) will be required when bone lesions are found in a single region on the bone scan. Appearance of metastatic lesions in 2 or more of the 5 regions on a bone scan will not require confirmation with a second imaging modality. Radiographic progression for soft tissue disease is defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).1 All study films should be read locally at the study site and submitted to the central imaging unit for independent central radiology review. Each study site should designate a radiologist or investigator as the primary imaging reviewer to ensure that all images are read consistently as specified in Section 9.1. In addition to imaging, the following assessments of prostate cancer status will be made during the course of the study: survival status, pain intensity and interference using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) (Appendix 1), PSA values, and quality of life as assessed by the FACT-P (Appendix 2), EQ-5D-5L (Appendix 3), and QLQ-PR25 (Appendix 4) questionnaires. Patients will have safety follow-up approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug. If a new antineoplastic treatment is initiated before 30 days after the last dose of study drug, then safety follow-up will occur immediately before starting the new treatment. Long-term follow-up assessments will include monitoring for survival status, new antineoplastic therapies for prostate cancer, opiate medications, skeletal-related events, and interventions due to locoregional progression (eg, radiation, transurethral resection of the prostate, nephrostomy tube placement). As the study met the primary efficacy endpoint of metastatis-free survival and the established safety profile of enzalutamide was confirmed, all patients will be unblinded. The complete details for the conduct of the open-label period are provided in Supplement 1: Open-Label Period.

Blinding All patients, study site personnel (including investigators), and sponsor staff and its representatives will be blinded to treatment assignment. The blinded control for this study will be placebo capsules (placebo) identical in appearance to the enzalutamide capsules. The procedure for breaking the blind in an emergency is provided in Section 8.2.2. Duration of Study The total duration of this study will be determined at the patient level and will depend on individual response to treatment. Patients are expected to receive study treatment until radiographic progression as specified in the protocol, have a safety follow-up visit, and then have long-term follow-up until the patient dies. Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group This study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in the treatment of patients with nonmetastatic CRPC. Androgen deprivation therapy will be continued for all patients on study as its use is common in clinical practice for the treatment of patients with CRPC. Enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg/day will be compared with placebo. A placebo-controlled trial is considered appropriate and ethical because there is no approved or standard treatment for patients with nonmetastatic CRPC."
" how was the study done? this study had two parts: the dose finding part and the dose expansion part. researchers tested 2 different doses of axitinib in combination with 2 milligrams per kilogram each participant weighed (also called mg/kg) of mk-3475 on a group of participants with advanced renal cell cancer to learn how safe the combination of axitinib and mk-3475. in the dose finding part of the study, participants were to take axitinib at a dose of 5 mg by mouth, twice a day. participants were also to take 2 mg/kg mk-3475 inside the vein (iv). after 3 weeks, the participants either continued taking the 5 mg dose of axitinib or were switched to the 3 mg dose of axitinib. the participants and researchers knew who took the 5 mg dose of axitinib and who took 3 mg dose of axitinib. all participants knew they were taking mk-3475. this is known as an open-label study. participants were assigned to each group by their doctor based on each participants condition. during the dose expansion part of the study, the participants from the dose finding part of the study continued to take these medications at the dose chosen by their doctors. new patients also joined the study and were given 1 of the 2 doses of axitinib as chosen by their doctors. researchers took samples of blood and urine from participants once every 3 weeks during both the dose finding and dose expansion parts of the study and measured the amounts of axitinib and mk-3475. researchers also checked the participants health during the study and asked them how they were feeling. researchers then compared the number of participants that had certain medical problems in the axitinib 5 mg to the participants taking axitinib 3 mg. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 10 locations in 1 country in north america. when did this study take place? it began 16 september 2014 and ended 03 july 2019. who participated in this study? the study included participants who were at least 18 years old, had advanced renal cell cancer, and at least 1 tumour their doctor could measure. a total of 41 men participated a total of 11 women participated all participants were between the ages of 28 and 75 years participants were to be treated until their cancer got worse, they chose to leave the study, or a doctor decided it was best for them to stop being in the study. of the 52 participants who started the study, no patients were still continuing in the study at the time of this report. how long did the study last? the amount of time that study participants were in the study varied depending on their response to the study treatment, but the entire study took 58 months to complete. when the study ended in july 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," The Dose Finding Phase will lead to the identification of an Expansion Test Dose for axitinib in combination with MK-3475 in patients with advanced RCC who did not receive prior systemic therapy. The Expansion Test Dose will be either the MTD (ie, the highest dose of axitinib and MK-3475 associated with the occurrence of DLTs in <33% of patients) or the RP2D, ie, the highest tested dose that is declared safe and tolerable by the Investigators and Sponsor. Once the Expansion Test Dose is identified, the Dose Expansion Phase will be opened and axitinib in combination with MK-3475 will be tested in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC. Intra-patient dose escalation for axitinib is permitted only after completing 12 weeks of treatment if the starting dose of axitinib is 5 mg BID (DL1), and after 6 weeks if axitinib starting dose is 3 mg BID (DL-1) (Section 5.2.7). Discontinuation from MK-3475 may be considered at the investigators discretion for patients who have attained a confirmed CR, have received at least 24 weeks of treatment with MK-3475, and have received at least two MK-3475 infusions beyond the date the CR was initially declared. Patients who then experience radiologic disease progression will be eligible for re-treatment with MK-3475 at the discretion of the investigator if no other cancer treatment was administered other than axitinib since the last dose of MK-3475, the patient still meets the safety parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and the trial is still open. However, according to the investigators clinical judgment and after discussion between the investigator and the Sponsor, if a patient with evidence of disease progression is still experiencing clinical benefit, he/she will be eligible for continued treatment with single agent axitinib, MK-3475 or axitinib combined with MK-3475 as long as the following criteria are met:  Absence of clinical signs and symptoms of disease progression. To understand the PK effects of MK-3475 on axitinib, a 7-day lead-in period of single-agent axitinib will be included prior to Cycle 1 in all patients in the Dose Finding Phase and in at least 8 patients in the Dose Expansion Phase of the study. Therefore, the effect of axitinib on MK-3475 will be evaluated by comparing MK-3475 pharmacokinetics at steady-state in the presence of axitinib with those reported for MK-3475 alone in prior studies. For all patients in the Dose Expansion Phase, a second tumor biopsy is strongly encouraged at the time of first tumor assessment (ie, 12 weeks) to assess the effects of the combination on the relevant pathways. Biomarker studies on tumor biospecimens including but not limited to tumor PD-L1 expression and blood levels of VEGF-A, IL-8 and VEGFR-2, will be carried out to help understand the mechanism of action of the axitinib plus MK-3475 combination, pharmacodynamic effects, as well as potential mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance. Starting Doses for Axitinib and MK-3475 (Dose Level 1) The starting doses (Dose Level 1) are axitinib 5 mg BID and MK-3475 2 mg/Kg IV Q3W in three-week cycles. Dose Levels in the Dose Finding Phase BID: twice daily; q3wk: every 3 weeks Possible dose finding scenarios based on the starting (1) dose level tolerability are illustrated in Table 2. In this dosing algorithm there are up to 2 potential dose levels (DL): (DL-1) MK-3475 2 mg/kg q3wk + axitinib 3 mg BID and (DL1) MK-3475 2 mg/kg q3wk + axitinib 5 mg BID. The first three patients will have to be evaluable for DLT before assigning DL for the next patient MTD = 30% As an example, if the total number of patients treated at DL1 is 3 the following dosing rules are applied:  0 - 1 DLT  remain at the same dose (DL1);  2 DLTs  de-escalate to DL-1 and allow for possible escalation back to DL1;  3 DLTs  de-escalate to DL-1 and consider DL1 as intolerable. If the dose is de-escalated to DL-1 and the total number of patients then treated at DL-1 is 3 the following dosing rules are applied:  0 DLTs  escalate back to DL1;  1 DLT  remain at the same dose (DL-1);  2-3 DLTs  de-escalation not possible consider DL-1 as intolerable.  If a patient withdraws from study treatment before receiving at least 75% of the planned first two cycles dose of axitinib or two infusions of MK-3475 within the DLT observation period for reasons other than study drug-related toxicity, another patient will be enrolled to replace that patient at the current dose level.  The RP2D will be confirmed in the Dose Expansion Phase, taking into account the MTD determination from the Dose Finding Phase, and other factors related to safety, efficacy, and PK/PD involving all available data from test cohorts. For the purpose of Dose Finding, any of the following adverse events occurring during the DLT observation period (6 weeks) that are attributable to one or both study drugs will be classified as DLTs:  Hematologic: Grade 4 neutropenia; Febrile neutropenia, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of >38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) for more than one hour; Grade 3 neutropenic infection; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. For axitinib, intra-patient dose escalation to higher doses may be permitted after 12 weeks of treatment if the starting dose of axitinib is 5 mg BID (DL1), and after 6 weeks if axitinib starting dose is 3 mg BID (DL-1) (see Section 5.2.7.1)."
" this study compared boys taking domagrozumab or placebo. the study included boys with dmd who were able to walk, and were at least 6 but younger than 16 years old when the study began. first, boys were screened by the study doctors. certain tests were done to make sure the boys were a good fit to join the study. next, boys were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. boys were assigned to each group by chance alone. putting boys into groups by chance helps make the groups more even to compare. the study was done in 2 parts, so that each boy would receive domagrozumab during part of the study. each part lasted about 48 weeks. the boys, their parents, and the researchers did not know who took domagrozumab and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. boys were assigned to each group by chance alone. group 1: 41 boys  part 1: domagrozumab starting at 5 milligrams per kilogram of weight (mg/kg), then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg  part 2: domagrozumab 40 mg/kg group 2: 39 boys  part 1: domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg  part 2: placebo group 3: 40 boys  part 1: placebo  part 2: domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg all study drugs were given as an iv infusion, which means that a needle is placed in the vein and the study drug slowly drips into the vein. when they came to study visits, boys were asked to complete questionnaires about their dmd symptoms and do tests, like the 4 stair climb test. finally, boys were asked to participate in 2 follow-up visits after they stopped study treatment. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. while boys were in the study for less than 2 years, the entire study took about 4 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 35 locations in australia, bulgaria, canada, italy, japan, poland, united kingdom, and united states. it began 24 november 2014 and ended 23 november 2018. all 120 participants were boys between the ages of 6 and 15. boys were to complete part 1 and part 2 of the study, and participate in 2 follow-up visits. of the 120 boys who entered the study and received study treatment, 65 boys (54%) completed it. 55 boys (46%) did not complete the study by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a boy to stop the study, or because the sponsor decided to stop the study early. the sponsor decided to stop the study early in november 2018, because results did not show that boys benefited from taking domagrozumab. after the study ended, the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Study Overview This is a Phase 2 randomized, 2-period, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of PF-06252616 administered to ambulatory boys diagnosed with DMD. PF-06252616 dose levels:  5 mg/kg  20 mg/kg  40 mg/kg Depending on safety and PK data availability, alternative dose levels will be available and may be evaluated instead of or in addition to the planned dose levels. Approximately 105 eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 sequence groups and receive investigational product for approximately 96 weeks (2 treatment periods of approximately 48 weeks each) stratified by their baseline time to complete the 4 SC (either  or 8 seconds). Sequence 1 (n=35): Period 1: Active treatment (PF-06252616) within subject dose escalation (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) Period 2: Active treatment (PF-06252616) at the maximum tolerated dose in Period 1 Sequence 2 (n=35): Period 1: Active treatment (PF-06252616) within subject dose escalation (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) Period 2: Placebo Sequence 3 (n=35): Period 1: Placebo Period 2: Active treatment (PF-06252616) within subject dose escalation (5, 20 and 40 mg/kg) Each dose level will be explored in a dose escalating fashion within subjects, starting with the lowest dose. At each dose level, the first 12 subjects will be asked to return for testing 1 week after the first dose within each level and once again at 1 week after the last dose at each dose level. The sites (with the exception of unblinded site personnel eg, the pharmacist) and the subjects will remain blinded to their study treatment through the conclusion of the study. Duration of Subject Participation Subjects participation will begin during the screening period (up to 6 weeks) followed by two dosing periods (48 weeks each) and 2 final study visits (ending 12 weeks after the last study dose). The end of the study will be the last visit of the last subject for purposes of closing out sites, informing the institutional review board/ethics committee (IRB/EC), and ceasing to send Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) reports. Following the interim analysis, if the E-DMC makes a recommendation to the sponsor management to modify or terminate the study based on establishing the efficacy and safety of PF-06252616, the sponsor management will review the recommendation with regulatory agencies prior to making any changes to the study design, including termination of the study. The dose adjustment criteria described in Table 2 will be used to determine if the dosing or dose level should be:  Escalated to the next dose level  Maintained at the current dose level  Reduced to a lower dose level, or  Stop dosing. The Investigator will confirm the number of doses received within the dose level and review all the available safety data along with the sponsor Medical Monitor with the exception of the serum iron indices (serum iron, serum ferritin, TIBC, % transferrin saturation) and the liver MRI results. Findings from the serum iron indices and the liver MRI may inadvertently unblind the Investigator and the sponsor Medical Monitor to the subjects treatment assignment, therefore results from these tests will not be available to the sites or sponsor Medical Monitor for review. Criteria to Determine Dose Adjustment within Individual Subjects a. R2* normal range is 75 Hz at 1.5 T or R2*139 Hz at 3.0 T b. R2* above normal range is >75 Hz and 190 Hz at 1.5 T or R2* is >139 Hz and 369 Hz at 3.0 T c. R2* mild overload range is R2* >190 Hz at 1.5 T or R2* >369 Hz at 3.0 T d. Storey et al, 2007; Wood et al, 2005; Hankins et al, 2009]).28,29,9 In order to maintain the treatment blind, all subjects regardless of treatment assignment will undergo review for dose adjustment. At any time during the study, either the Investigator and/or sponsor Medical Monitor may determine a safety issue has occurred and it is in the best interest of the subject to stop dosing. Subjects in Sequence 2, Period 2, and Sequence 3 Period 1 (who are assigned to placebo), will have dosing terminated should they meet any of the criteria described in Table 2 for Stop Dosing. Subjects, who plan to enroll in the OLE study, will have their maximum tolerated dose from study B5161002 be provided by the Designated Reviewer following Week 93 in order to continue on the same dose level in the OLE study without unblinding their treatment assignment in the B5161002 study. The E-DMC will also include a Cardiology Expert to E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing unblinded efficacy and safety monitoring (including the liver MRI and iron indices whose results are blinded to the site and study team) per the E-DMC charter from the initiation of the study through the final study visit. Following each data review, the E-DMC will provide a recommendation to the sponsor management to continue the study, modify the study and then continue (eg, terminate a dose level, reduce the liver MRI assessment to annually, remove the manual process for individual dose escalation steps and allow an automated dose-escalation, permit the liver MRI and iron indices data to be provided to the site and blinded study team), or stop the study (eg, due to safety). The E-DMC will consider the following safety criteria during their safety review:  The number of subjects who have severe AEs or serious AEs in the same organ system which are determined to be related to study medication (active treatment, not placebo)."
" how was the study done? this study was done in 2 parts. during part 1, participants were given different doses of pf-04518600. doses ranged from 0.01 milligrams per kilogram of weight (mg/kg) to 10 mg/kg iv (in the vein), or 30 mg or 250 mg iv. the dose given to participants was increased until the highest dose that could be safely tolerated was reached. this is called the maximum tolerated dose. the dose that each participant received stayed the same throughout the study, and depended on when they joined the study and how many participants had already been treated. some participants in part 1 were in the expansion group. these participants were required to have tumor biopsies (removal of cells or tissue) to look at the effect of pf-04518600 on the immune cells and cancer cells in their tumor, and to determine if specific cancer genes were turned on or off in the tumor. the first biopsy took place before the first dose of study drug, and a second biopsy took place about 6 weeks later. some participants, including those with skin cancer (melanoma), also had a third biopsy about 6 weeks after the second biopsy. all participants in part 2 received pf-04518600 doses closer to the maximum tolerated dose that was determined in the first part of the study (0.1 mg/kg to 3.0 mg/kg iv). they also received utomilumab, at a dose of 20 mg or 100 mg iv every 4 weeks. all participants in part 2 were in the expansion group and were required to have tumor biopsies. study treatment was broken up into 14 day cycles. treatment was given on day 1 of each cycle. participants were watched closely for any medical problems throughout the study. participants were expected to attend the following visits at the study center:  days 1, 2, and 8 of the first 14 day cycle  days 1 and 8 of the second and third cycle  day 1 of each remaining cycle  an end of treatment visit about 1 month after they stopped taking study treatment there was no maximum number of treatment cycles. participants could continue in the study as long as treatment was safely tolerated and their cancer was not getting worse. this was an open-label study, which means that the study doctors and participants knew which treatment and dose was given. the figures below show what happened during the study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 14 locations in france, netherlands, japan, and the united states. when did this study take place? it began 23 april 2015 and ended 25 november 2020. who participated in this study? this study included adult participants who:  had locally advanced or metastatic cancer that started in the head and neck, skin (melanoma), liver, kidney, lung, bladder, stomach, or cervix  had tried standard cancer treatments without adequate results, or had declined standard cancer treatments  had at least 1 tumor that could be measured  were examined by the study doctor and determined to be healthy enough to participate in the study during part 1:  a total of 75 men participated  a total of 12 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 23 and 81 years during part 2:  a total of 50 men participated  a total of 37 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 22 and 85 years participants could continue in the study as long as treatment was safely tolerated and their cancer was not getting worse. of the 87 participants who started part 1, 14 (16%) completed the study. 73 participants (84%) did not finish the study because they died or chose to leave the study. of the 87 participants who started part 2, 1 (1%) completed the study. 86 participants (99%) did not finish the study because they died or chose to leave the study. how long did the study last? the amount of time that participants were in the study varied. the entire study took more than 5 years to complete. in october 2018, the sponsor decided to stop enrolling participants in this study due to business reasons. this decision was not due to any safety concerns. participants already enrolled in the study continued as planned. when the study ended in november 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. what medical problems did participants have during the study? the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. all participants (100%) in part 1 had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 9 participants (10%) in part 1 stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems, and 2 of these participants stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems that were considered to be related to the study treatment (heart failure and liver injury). all participants (100%) in part 2 had at least 1 medical problem. a total of 11 participants (13%) in part 2 stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems, and 2 of these participants stopped taking study treatment because of medical problems that were considered to be related to the study treatment ( reaction to iv infusion and rash). the most common medical problems  those reported by at least 15% of participants  are described below. below are instructions on how to read tables 1 to 4. instructions for understanding tables 1 to 4.  the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during part 1. all medical problems reported by at least 15% of participants are listed.  the 2nd column tells how many of the 87 participants taking the study medication reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 87 participants taking the study medication who reported the medical problem.  using these instructions, you can see that 31 out of the 87 participants (36%) taking the study medication reported feeling tired. how many participants had dose-limiting toxicities? dose-limiting toxicities are certain medical problems caused by taking study treatment, which require the participant to lower the dose or stop taking the treatment (permanently or temporarily). no participants in this study had dose-limiting toxicities. the participants who stopped taking study treatment (9 participants in part 1 and 11 participants in part 2) did so for other medical problems. did study participants have any serious medical problems? a medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 29 out of 87 participants (33%) in part 1 had at least 1 serious medical problem. 30 out of 87 participants (35%) in part 2 had at least 1 serious medical problem. the most common medical problems  those reported by more than 1 participant  are described below. for part 1, a total of 57 (66%) participants died:  44 deaths were due to cancer  13 deaths were due to unknown or other reasons  none of the deaths were related to study treatment  2participants died duringthe study or within 28 days offinishing study treatment for part 2, a total of 65 (75%) participants died:  44 deaths were due to cancer  2 deaths were due to toxicity from study treatment  19 deaths were due to unknown or other reasons  9participants died during the study or within 28 days of finishing study treatment this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. these are just some of the main findings of this study. other studies may have different results. where can i learn more about this study?

Part A1 Dose Escalation Part A1 will study doses of PF-04518600 in sequential dose levels (0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.5, 3 and 10 mg/kg) of adult patients with advanced or metastatic HCC, melanoma, clear cell RCC or HNSCC who are unresponsive to currently available therapies or for whom no standard therapy is available. The actual number of patients enrolled will therefore depend on the observed safety and tolerability profile of PF-04518600 monotherapy, the number of dose levels that will be explored or expanded to characterize the pharmacodynamic effects, the number of dose levels required to identify the MTD or OBD. If late immune related DLTs occur, all safety data will be reviewed and a decision will be made whether or not to permanently stop enrollment in the higher cohorts and declare the MTD, to continue enrollment in the cohort, to increase the number of patients evaluated in that cohort or to stop The proposed doses, schedule(s) and PK time points may be reconsidered and amended during the study based on the emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data. The flat dose that is equivalent to 0.3 mg/kg was determined to be 25 mg in terms of matching the center of the distributions based on the population PK/PD analysis using preliminary data from Part A1 of this study. Therefore, Arm 2 will evaluate a 3 mg/kg flat dose equivalent of 250 mg. An additional flat dose level of 800 mg, approximately equivalent to 10 mg/kg, may be added after initiation of enrollment into Arms 1 and 2 if this is supported by emerging data from the 10 mg/kg cohort of Part A1. Part B1 will study sequential dose levels of PF-04518600 (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3 mg/kg, with an option of 10 mg/kg pending data from Part A1) combined with 20 mg or 100 mg of utomilumab in adult patients with NSCLC, HNSCC, melanoma, bladder, gastric or cervical cancer who are unresponsive to currently available therapies or for whom no standard therapy is available. If patients at the 0.3 mg/kg dose level in Part A1 OX40 monotherapy experiences  Grade 2 immune related toxicities or cytokine release syndrome, starting dose of PF-04518600 will be 0.01 mg/kg combined with 20 mg of utomilumab. The mTPI method for dose escalation adopted for PF-04518600 monotherapy in Part A1 will also be used in PF-04518600/utomilumab combination therapy in Part B1, and targets a dose limiting toxicities (DLT) rate of 25% and an acceptable DLT interval (20%-30%),7 will be utilized for dose escalation (see Section 3.1.5 Criteria for Dose Escalation).88 Utomilumab Y (500) )gm( bamulimotU 100 20 10 0.01 0.1 0.3 1 3 10 PF-04518600 (mg/kg) * If first 6 patients at the 0.3 mg/kg dose level in Part A1 OX40 monotherapy experience  Grade 2 immune related toxicities or cytokine release syndrome, starting dose of PF-04518600 will be 0.01 mg/kg combined with 20 mg of utomilumab in Part B1. The mTPI model performs dose escalation by increasing or decreasing the dose of either PF-04518600, utomilumab or both based on the observed number and/or nature of DLTs at the current dose combination level (see Figure 5). From the results of Part B1, the selected dose for PF-04518600 in the B2 combination therapy dose expansion cohorts is 30 mg (a flat dose equivalent to 0.3 mg/kg) intravenously (IV) Q2W in combination with PF-05082566 20 mg IV every 28 days. Japan participation in Part B Combination Therapy Japan will participate in Part B after safety of PF-04518600 of at least 2 dose levels as a single agent has been evaluated in Japanese patients (See Section 3.1.1.3 Japan Cohorts in Part A Monotherapy). Following the completion of the safety assessment of at least 2 dose levels for Japanese patients in Part A1, and if deemed acceptable by the local health authorities, the combination of PF-04518600 with utomilumab may also be tested in order to evaluate the safety of the combination therapy in patients enrolled in Japan. Beginning with the starting dose of 0.01 mg/kg, if either a DLT related to PF-04518600 or a grade 2 cytokine release syndrome, infusion reaction, or allergic reaction is observed, subsequent dosages will not be increased by more than 3-fold, or one- half a log (eg, increases from 0.01 mg/kg will be to 0.03 mg/kg, and increases from 0.3 mg/ kg will be to 1.0 mg/kg). Selected dose for PF-04518600 in the B2 combination therapy dose expansion cohorts is 30 mg (a flat dose equivalent to 0.3 mg/kg) intravenously (IV) Q2W in combination with PF-05082566 20 mg IV every 28 days. For the purpose of dose escalation, any of the following adverse events occurring in the first two cycle of treatment (28 days) will be classified as DLTs, unless there is a clear alternative explanation (eg, related to underlying disease/progression): Hematologic:  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days. All safety data will be evaluated and a decision will be made whether or not to permanently stop enrollment in the higher cohorts and declare the MTD, to continue enrollment in the cohort, to increase the number of patients evaluated in that cohort or to stop the study (see Section 3.2.1 Late Immune Related DLTs)."
" this study compared several groups of patients taking pf-06747775 to see what dlts the patients had, and to see if their nsclc improved. the study included patients  18 years old who met the following conditions:  all patients: had an acceptable medical history and a confirmed diagnosis of the specific type of nsclc that this treatment may help, as well as available tissue biopsy samples from the tumor.  japanese patients only: patients whose cancer was advanced/metastatic (spread to other parts of the body). the patients cancer either did not respond to standard therapy, or there was no standard therapy available, or the patients did not want to receive standard therapy for their cancer. there was no maximum number of treatment cycles. patients continued in the study as long as they responded to treatment and as long as they were willing to participate. this was a randomized, open-label study, which means that the patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. this also means that the doctors and patients knew what they were being treated with. a diagram of the study design is shown below. while patients were only in the study for as long as they safely tolerated pf-06747775 treatment and responded to treatment, the entire study took 5 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in 4 countries: australia, japan, korea, and united states (us). it began 14 may 2015 and ended 28 may 2020. twenty-five (25) men and 40 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 37 and 81. patients were to be treated until their cancer got worse, their general health got worse, they had too many medical problems, the patient wanted to stop, or until the patient had passed away. of the 65 patients who started the study, all patients stopped study treatment early. thirty (30) of the 65 patients (46%) left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. this study was stopped early because of changes to the way that nsclc is now treated. when the study ended in may 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," The overall clinical study consists of a Phase 1 single agent dose-escalation and expansion part to determine the RP2D of PF-06747775 single agent in patients with previously-treated EGFRm NSCLC followed by sequential evaluations of PF-06747775 at the RP2D in 3 different clinical scenarios as detailed below:  Cohort 1: Phase 2 evaluation of PF-06747775 as a single agent in previously untreated patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC;  Cohort 2: Phase 1b single arm evaluation of PF-06747775 in combination with palbociclib (Cohort 2A) followed by Phase 2 randomized evaluation of PF-06747775 in combination with palbociclib vs PF-06747775 single agent (Cohort 2B) in previously-treated patients with EGFRm NSCLC with a secondary T790M mutation (del 19 and T790M or L858R and T790M); and  Cohort 3: Phase 1b evaluation of PF-06747775 in combination with avelumab for previously-treated patients with EGFRm NSCLC with a secondary T790M mutation (del 19 and T790M or L858R and T790M). In any case, the assessment of the potential CYP3A4 inhibitory effect of PF-06747775 at a dose that might be greater than the RP2D will not impact the estimation of the CYP3A4 inhibitory effect of PF-06747775, on the contrary, it will show the maximum inhibitory effect that can be achieved at the RP2D. The first three patients (ie, the first cohort) will be treated at 25 mg, and the following dose level explored will be 50 mg. To assign the dose level for each subsequent patient, the probability of DLT is estimated to a target rate of 30%. Patients who discontinue treatment before completing Cycle 1 (ie, the DLT evaluation time window) or receive less than 15 of the planned 21 PF-06747775 doses for reasons other than treatment-related toxicity (eg, missed appointments, misplaced investigational product supplies, development of coexisting medical condition rendering the patient unable to swallow medication, development of rapidly progressing disease) will be replaced for DLT evaluation but will remain in the overall safety and efficacy analyses. Cohort 2 of the study consists of a Phase 1b single-arm evaluation of the safety, PK, and PD of the RP2D of PF-06747775 in combination with palbociclib (Cohort 2A) followed by a Phase 2 randomized evaluation of antitumor activity and safety of the combination vs PF-06747775 single agent (Cohort 2B) in patients with previously-treated advanced EGFRm NSCLC (del 19 and T790M or L858R and T790M).

Dose finding sequences and dose finding decision rules based on mTPI will be similar as stated in Section 3.1.3 with a few exceptions:  The patients who are enrolled in DL1 will be monitored for 1 cycle (28 days) for DLTs;  If a patient does not receive at least 70% of the first 4 weeks doses of PF-6747775 or does not receive at least 2 infusions of avelumab within the DLT observation period (1 cycle = 28 days) for reasons other than investigational product-related toxicity, another patient will be enrolled to replace that patient at the current dose level. Japanese Patient-Only Lead In Cohort This study will include a Japanese patient lead in cohort (LIC) to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of PF-06747775 in Japanese patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC at RP2D (PF-06747775 200 mg) when given as a single agent. Phase 1b Cohort 2 In addition to the definitions described for the evaluation of PF-06747775 single agent above (Section 3.2.1), the following AEs occurring during the 42-day DLT period (ie, Cycles 1 and 2) that are attributable to one, the other, or both compounds in the combination of PF-06747775 plus palbociclib will be classified as DLTs:  Any treatment-related, maximally treated AE that causes a palbociclib treatment delay of greater than 10 consecutive days;  Any treatment-related AE, except for neutropenia, that is maximally treated but still causes omission of at least 12 of the 42 doses within the 2 cycles used for DLT determination of the combination (ie, either drug to be held). Substitutions to this test meal can be made after discussion with the sponsor, as long as the meal provides a similar amount of calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat and has comparable meal volume and viscosity (if substitutions are made, the contents of the meal will be documented by a dietitian or designate to confirm it matches the Food and described above).  Rifampin + PF-06747775 Treatment: On Days 10 to 20 of Cycle 1, besides the daily dose of PF-06747775 at the RP2D, 600 mg of rifampin will be given to patients at approximately the same time once daily in the morning 2 hours prior to breakfast. The dose of PF-06747775 used in the itraconazole portion of this sub-study may also be modified in order to avoid increased PF-06747775 exposure in patients at RP2D due to potent CYP3A4 inhibition by itraconazole and/or if the results of the 4--hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol analysis suggest significant CYP3A4 inhibition by PF-06747775."
" this study compared 2 groups of patients taking either pf-06439535 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin or avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin, to determine if pf-06439535 works in a similar way to avastin. the study included adult patients with either newly diagnosed or recurring nsclc. for patients with recurring nsclc, the last systemic treatment (a treatment that affects the whole body) should have been received at least 6 months ago. the patients and researchers did not know who took which medicines. this is known as a blinded study. patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to join the study. this was known as the screening period, which lasted up to 28 days. next, patients were assigned to receive either pf-06439535 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin or avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin. patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. putting people into groups by chance helps to make the groups more even to compare. the medicines were given by iv infusion (a needle into the vein). during the first part of this study, patients received 4 to 6 infusions of either pf-06439535 plus paclitaxel and carboplatin or avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin. the infusions were given once every 21 days. during the second part of this study, paclitaxel and carboplatin were stopped, and the infusions included only pf-06439535 or avastin. this lasted until the end of the study. finally, there was a follow-up period, which lasted for 28 days after the patients finished taking study treatment. the figure below shows what happened during this study. patients were considered to have completed the study at 1 year, although some patients were in the study longer than 1 year. the entire study took more than 2 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 216 locations in africa, asia, australia, europe, north america, and south america (however, no patients joined the study at 57 of these locations). it began 20 april 2015 and ended 22 december 2017. 467 men (65%) and 252 women (35%) participated. all patients were between the ages of 25 and 87. patients were to be treated for 1 year and complete the 28 day follow-up period. a total of 719 patients joined the study, but only 714 received study treatment. of these 714 patients, 380 (53%) finished the study. there were 334 patients who left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study, or because they passed away. when the study ended in december 2017, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Study Overview This is a multinational, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab-Pfizer plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus bevacizumab-EU plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in first-line treatment for patients with advanced (unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic), non-squamous NSCLC. Approximately 355 patients will be enrolled in each treatment arm for a total of approximately 710 patients at over 300 centers; up to approximately 10% more patients may be enrolled due to operational/logistical considerations. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive at least 4 and no more than 6 cycles of either bevacizumab-Pfizer plus paclitaxel and carboplatin or bevacizumab-EU plus paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by the assigned blinded bevacizumab monotherapy. Randomization will be stratified by region (according to the location of the drug depot supplying the site), sex (male/female) and smoking history (never/ever). Patients will participate in the study on average for approximately 13 months. This includes about 1 month of screening and at least 1 year of treatment and follow-up. Actual length of participation for individual patients will depend upon the actual duration of treatment. Minimum expected participation is approximately 1 year unless shorter due to death, progression on therapy, withdrawal of consent, or early termination of the trial. The study is considered complete (End of Study) when the last patient has completed the last subject last visit (LSLV). LSLV is defined as up to 1 year from randomization of the last patient (End of Treatment) plus 28 day follow-up. See study schema (Figure 1) in Study Design section for details."
" this study evaluated a group of patients who received dacomitinib in previous studies for advanced nsclc, to have them continue treatment with dacomitinib. the study included patients who had advanced nsclc and who received dacomitinib in a previous study in japan (study a7471009 or study a7471050) without unpleasant side effects based on the researchers evaluation. for this study, 3 different dose strengths of dacomitinib oral tablets were planned:  45 mg per day  30 mg per day  15 mg per day the dose strength patients started on in this study, was the same as the dose the patient ended on in the previous study. there were 7 patients included in this study; 5 patients started at a dose of 15 mg once a day and 2 patients started at a dose of 30 mg once a day. this was an open-label study, which means that the patients and the researchers knew which medicine the patients received. the figure below shows what happened during the study. the sponsor ran this study in japan. it began 10 july 2015 and ended 30 may 2019. three (3) men and 4 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 68 and 76 and had an average weight of 56 kg. the study doctor was allowed to change the strength of the dacomitinib dose during the study, depending on how the treatment made the patients feel. patients were to be treated until there was evidence of the study drug helping to relief nsclc symptoms, as determined by the study doctor. all 7 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study, of which 3 patients left as dacomitinib became available on the market. when the study ended in may 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a multi-center, open-label, treatment extension study open in Japan only. Eligible patients include those with advanced cancer who received and tolerated single-agent dacomitinib in a prior clinical study and have the potential to derive continued clinical benefit based on investigator judgment. Patients enrolled in this extension study may continue to receive dacomitinib starting at the current dose level in the prior study. Dose reductions and re-escalations are allowed based on tolerability. Patients may continue to be treated with dacomitinib on this protocol as long as there is evidence of clinical benefit in the judgment of the investigator. Adverse events will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0, and monitored according to the frequency outlined in the Safety Review Plan."
" this study compared 2 groups of children to learn more about the safety and effectiveness of caz-avi when given together with metronidazole, compared to another antibiotic medicine called meropenem. meropenem is commonly used to treat complicated iai in children. this study was for children who were diagnosed with complicated iai. the children in this study were at least 3 months old, but younger than 18 years old when they started the study. first, the children were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit for the study. this was called screening. the children were grouped by age:  group 1 (30 children): at least 12 years old, but younger than 18 years old  group 2 (43 children): at least 6 years old, but younger than 12 years old  group 3 (9 children): at least 2 years old, but younger than 6 years old  group 4 (1 child): at least 3 months old, but younger than 2 years old the children were assigned to join 1 of 2 treatment groups. children in the first treatment group received caz-avi plus another antibiotic called metronidazole. children in the second treatment group received an antibiotic called meropenem. these medicines were given into a vein with a small tube, and the doses were based on each childs weight. the children were picked to receive either treatment by chance alone. children received either caz-avi plus metronidazole or meropenem for at least 3 days. depending on what the study doctor thought was best for each child, after 3 days of either caz-avi plus metronidazole or meropenem given into a vein, some children may have switched to an antibiotic medicine you can take by mouth. some children could have received either caz-avi plus metronidazole or meropenem for up to 15 days. this was a single-blind study, which means that the children, their study doctor, pharmacist, parents/caregivers, and most of the researchers knew which medicine they received. however, one study doctor who examined the children did not know which medicine they were given. safety was carefully monitored throughout the study. the study doctors examined each child, did blood or urine tests, and watched for any medical problems. the study doctors also followed up with the children for 27 to 50 days after they started study treatment. while children were only in the study for up to 50 days (treatment plus follow-up), the entire study took almost 2 years to complete. children joined the study at 1 of 29 locations in 10 countries (czech republic, greece, hungary, poland, romania, russian federation, spain, taiwan, turkey, and united states). the first child joined the study on 01 august 2015, and the last child finished the study on 01 june 2017. a total of 30 girls and 53 boys joined the study. children could receive study treatment for a total of 7 to 15 days, and come to a visit 8 to 15 days after the last day they got the study treatment. the children could come to a follow-up visit 27 to 50 days after the first day they got the study treatment. in total, 83 children started the study and 81 children (98%) completed it, including coming back for the last visit. there were 2 children (2%) who did not finish the study because of parent/guardian choice, or because a doctor decided it was best for the child not to continue in the study. the figure below shows what happened during this study. when the study ended in june 2017, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years with cIAIs will be randomised to 1 of 2 treatment groups (3:1 ratio): CAZ-AVI in combination with metronidazole versus meropenem. A sufficient number of patients are to be randomised 3:1 for 80 patients to complete at least 72 hours (3 full days, ie, 9 doses) of study treatment (ie, evaluable patients; at least 60 patients in the CAZ-AVI group and at least 20 patients in the meropenem group). Randomisation will be stratified as follows:  Cohort 1: At least 15:5 evaluable patients aged from 12 years to <18 years  Cohort 2: At least 15:5 evaluable patients aged from 6 years to <12 years  Cohort 3: No required minimum of evaluable patients aged from 2 years to <6 years  Cohort 4: No required minimum of evaluable patients aged from 3 months to <2 years, comprising Cohorts 4a and 4b as follows:  Cohort 4a: Patients aged from 1 year to <2 years  Cohort 4b: Patients aged from 3 months to <1 year Intravenous CAZ-AVI infusions will be given at doses based on age and weight with adjustment according to renal function as detailed in Table 5. Patients withdrawing from study therapy can be administered alternative therapies at the Investigators choice, which should be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF). Because the CrCl determination is only an estimate of renal function, in instances where the CrCl is approaching thresholds that would require intervention such as a dose change or discontinuation of therapy (ie CrCL approaching 50 or 30 mL/min), the Investigator should use his or her discretion in determining (ie confirming the value by repeat testing, if feasible) whether an immediate dose in the opinion of the Investigator there is a clinically significant reduction in a patients estimated CrCl during the treatment period, then the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the above mentioned options (immediate dose change, a short period of continued observation, or discontinuation of therapy). Additionally, in instances of rapidly changing renal function, the Investigator should increase the frequency of CrCl monitoring, depending on the patients clinical status, extent of renal function change and Investigators clinical evaluation. The suggested dosing regimen of metronidazole is 10 mg/kg IV over 20 to 30 minutes every 8 hours (30 minutes), but it can also be prescribed/adjusted by the Investigator according to local labels. The metronidazole infusion will be started no later than 30 minutes after completion of the CAZ-AVI infusion. The dose/regimen of meropenem will be 20 mg/kg every 8 hours (1 hour) infused over approximately 15 to 30 minutes or up to 1 hour (or infusion duration as per local guidelines). For patients weighing over 50 kg, the maximum dose of meropenem should not exceed 1 g every 8 hours. Patients will receive IV treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, ie, 9 doses) before having the option to switch to an oral therapy, as specified in Section 7.7 below. The decision to switch to oral therapy is entirely at the Investigators discretion, if the patient has good or sufficient clinical response, and the patient is tolerating oral fluids or food. The total period of treatment (ie, IV drug and oral switch treatment) is to be between 7 and 15 days. Patients may remain on the IV study treatment for the full 7 to 15 days. The duration of each patients participation in the study will be a minimum of 27 days to a maximum of 50 days after start of study treatment at which time there will be a LFU assessment visit.

" researchers in this study initially intended to look at 3 groups of patients treated with fidanacogene elaparvovec at 1 of 3 dose levels. this was done to see if patients had any medical problems after this treatment and also see if this treatment could prevent bleeding episodes. fidanacogene elaparvovec was given as an intravenous (iv) infusion, which means that a needle is placed in the vein and the study drug slowly drips into the vein. a total of 22 patients were screened, 15 patients received fidanacogene elaparvovec. all 15 patients received the lowest dose in the study (5 x 1011 vg/kg). no patient received the 2 higher doses of fidanacogene elaparvovec. results presented here are from the lowest dose level. patients were treated with 100 iu/kg of their usual fix protein product over more or less 10 minutes at day 0 visit. after this, the patients were treated with fidanacogene elaparvovec (5 x 1011 vg/kg) for approximately 60 minutes via infusion pump, as shown in the figure below. this was an open-label study, so everyone, including the patient, knew what treatment was given. the study included patients who were men of 18 years of age and older with less than or equal to 2% fix levels. while patients were only in the study for 1 year, the entire study took more than 3 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 5 locations in 2 countries (australia and united states). it began 18 november 2015 and ended 08 april 2019. all patients were men. all patients were between the ages of 18 and 61 years. patients were to be treated with a single iv infusion. of the 15 patients who started the study, all finished the study. when the study ended in april 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Overall Design This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation and multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and kinetics of a single IV infusion of PF-06838435 in hemophilia B participants with 2IU/dL [2%] endogenous factor IX [FIX]). At least 8 weeks of safety data from at least 3 out of 5 participants in a given dose level will undergo review by the independent DMC prior to infusing the first participant in the next dose level (See Section 4.1.1 for staggering strategy). If one or both of the first two participants in any dose level achieve circulating vector- derived FIX activity levels above their baseline (without using any FIX product) but with a decline to their baseline levels due to an immune response to vector capsid that is NOT well-managed by corticosteroids, then dose escalation will not occur, and instead up to a total of 5 evaluable participants will be dosed at the respective dose. Immunomodulation Optimization (ONLY for Participants Who Develop Hepatitis Transaminitis) Based on observation and experience from earlier clinical studies of liver-directed AAV gene transfer, including the SJ-UCL trial3, 5, earlier clinical studies sponsored by Spark Therapeutics, who was also the initial Sponsor of this study, and the Baxter trial (NCT#01687608), participants may develop an apparent immune response to the vector capsid participants, as evidenced by a transient rise in transaminases (AST and/or ALT) and an increase in AAV capsid-specific T cells in the peripheral blood. To utilize the lowest effective dose and to shorten the duration of the immunosuppressive therapies, tapering of the regimen will start as soon as there is evidence of resolution of hepatic transaminases elevation and disappearance from the peripheral blood of capsid-specific T cells. Thrombotic Potential Assessments (ONLY for Participants Who Reach Vector- derived FIX:C Activity Levels >150% after the infusion of PF-06838435) Based on non-clinical studies in NHPs and the and the now closed Baxter study using hFIX- Padua, it is not predicted that vector-derived FIX:C activity levels >150% of normal will be achieved in this study. The total duration of the study is approximately 58 weeks (including up to 6 weeks of Potential participants will undergo the screening assessments described in the Schedule of Activities up to 6 (2) weeks prior to the infusion of PF-06838435 once the consent process is completed at the vector-administration center. If the screening result of FIX:C activity level is >2% due to recent infusion of factor IX protein product, then the severity of hemophilia B may be confirmed by documented historical evidence from a certified laboratory demonstrating the FIX:C activity level 2% or from a documented genotype known to produce a clinically severe phenotype of hemophilia B. Participants will receive a bolus infusion of FIX protein product in about 10 minutes for FIX incremental recovery (Section 6.1.1) followed by a single IV infusion of PF-06838435 at the vector-administration center. Blood samples for FIX incremental recovery will be collected pre-infusion of the FIX protein product, 10 (2) minutes [end-of-infusion], 1 hour  10 minutes, 3 hours  10 minutes, 6 hours  10 minutes, and 24 (1) hours from the start-of-infusion. Safety of these dose levels is supported by previous human clinical trials of AAV2 and AAV8 vectors encoding hFIX, as well as the NHP studies with AAV-Spark100-hFIX19- Padua and with SPK-9001, in which dose levels up to 5x1012 vg/kg were infused without evidence of adverse effects. Furthermore, non-clinical safety data demonstrate that doses of 1x1012 vg/kg, 2x1012 vg/kg and 5x1012 vg/kg are generally well tolerated in NHPs and support the proposed up to three dose levels of 5x1011, 1x1012, and 2x1012 vg/kg to be investigated in this study. It is worth noting that the preliminary data of an ongoing Baxter trial (NCT#01687608) using self-complementary AAV8-hFIX-Padua (BAX-335), presented at the 8th Annual Congress of the EAHAD on 12th February 2015 in Helsinki, Finland, showed vector-derived FIX:C activity levels of ranging from <1  60% at doses of 2 x1011 vg/kg, 1x102 vg/kg and 3x102 vg/kg with no safety concerns6. The occurrence of any of the following medically important events will result in suspension of further enrollment while the events are under investigation:  Any drug-related death during the study;  Any participant develops drug-related or possibly drug-related Grade III-IV toxicity such as FIX inhibitor, allergic reaction (bronchospasm and anaphylaxis), excluding elevated transaminases;  Any participant develops drug-related or possibly drug-related Grade III-IV elevated transaminases that fails to improve or resolve within four weeks on the immunosuppressive regimens;  Any participant develops drug-related or possibly drug-related Grade IV (>10-fold) elevated transaminases;  Any participant reaches >150% of normal vector-derived FIX:C activity levels and develops drug-related or possibly drug-related thrombotic event after vector infusion (with the exception of IV infusion-site thrombophlebitis) or if any participant develops a sustained (defined as > 6 weeks) FIX activity levels of >150%;  Participant experience a medically important event that warrants further evaluation;  Any occurrence of a malignancy at any point after vector infusion that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational product. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he has completed all phases of the study including the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities. Any AEs, safety events or unscheduled visits between Week 52 (or End-of-Study) of this study and the first study visit of the extension study will be captured in the source data for the subject and entered into the extension study database after the subject has agreed and completed the informed consent process."
" the study evaluated a group of patients who did not receive any treatment for advanced rcc before joining this study, to find out what dose of avelumab was best to use in future clinical studies, when taken in combination with axitinib. three different dose strength combinations of avelumab and axitinib were planned. the highest planned dose combination of avelumab and axitinib (dl1) was found to be an acceptable dose in this study, and therefore the other 2 combinations (dl-1a and dl-1b) were not explored. avelumab was given into the vein through a small needle, and axitinib tablets were taken by mouth. the treatment groups for this dose-finding phase are shown below:  dl1: avelumab 10 milligrams (mg) for each kilogram (kg) of the patients body weight, every 2 weeks + axitinib 5 mg, 2 times a day  dl-1a: avelumab 5 mg for each kg of body weight, every 2 weeks + axitinib 5 mg, 2 times a day (planned, but not investigated in this study)  dl-1b: avelumab 10 mg for each kg of body weight, every 2 weeks + axitinib 3 mg, 2 times a day (planned, but not investigated in this study) this was an open-label study, which means that the patients and the researchers knew which medicine the patients received. the figure below shows what happened during this study. there were 2 parts in the study. the first part was the dose-finding phase. in this part of the study, the highest dose level, dl1, was tested to see if it is safe to use in further studies. the second part was the dose expansion phase. in this part of the study, the dl1 dose combination was given to patients to make sure that the right dose was chosen for future studies. to understand what happens to axitinib in the body, 16 patients received axitinib tablets alone for 7 days (this was known as the lead in period) prior to the combination (avelumab + axitinib). the sponsor ran this study at 14 locations in the united kingdom, the united states, and japan. it began 15 october 2015 and is ongoing. 42 men and 13 women participated. 38 patients were younger than 65 years, and 17 patients were 65 years or older. at the time of data collection, patients were in the study for almost 3 years; the study was ongoing. patients were to be treated in the dose-finding phase until dlt data from 6 patients on the highest dose of avelumab and axitinib were collected. this dose was then given in the dose-expansion phase of the study, to test the safety and effectiveness of the dose. fifty-five patients received the study medications. at the time of data collection, 20 patients were still receiving the study medications: 31% (17 out of 55) of patients were still treated with both study medications, 2% (1 out of 55) of patients were still treated with avelumab alone, and 4% (2 out of 55) of patients were still being treated with axitinib alone. thirty-five patients discontinued study medication. the main reason why patients discontinued study medication was because their advanced rcc worsened. when the data were collected in april 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," The Dose Finding Phase will estimate the MTD and RP2D in patients with aRCC with clear cell histology who did not receive prior systemic therapy for advanced disease, using the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method.29 Dose finding will follow an mTPI design, with up to 3 potential dose levels (DL) to be tested:  (DL1) avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 5 mg BID. To understand the extent of any effects of avelumab on axitinib PK, a 7-day lead-in period with single-agent axitinib will be included prior to Cycle 1 in all patients in the Dose Finding Phase of the study. The Expansion Test Dose will either be the MTD (ie, the highest dose of avelumab and axitinib associated with the occurrence of DLTs in <33% of patients) or the RP2D, ie, the highest tested dose that is declared safe and Dose Expansion Phase will be opened, and avelumab in combination with axitinib will be evaluated in up to approximately 40 patients with previously untreated aRCC. Based on the emerging PK data and after the completion of the dose-finding part of the study based on mTPI method, it may be necessary to enroll up to approximately 8 additional patients to further assess the effect of avelumab on the PK of axitinib. These additional patients will undergo the same evaluations and procedures as those described in the Schedule of Activities table for the Dose Finding Phase of the study and will be treated concurrently with the initiation of the Dose Expansion Phase of the study. Patients who stop avelumab after initial clinical benefit while on treatment and then experience radiologic disease progression thereafter will be eligible for re-treatment with avelumab at the discretion of the investigator and after discussion with the sponsors medical monitor if 1) no cancer treatment was administered other than axitinib since the last dose of avelumab, 2) the patient does not meet the safety withdrawal criteria, and 3) the trial is still open. This is particularly true for immunotherapeutic agents such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies which exert their antitumor activity by augmenting activation and proliferation of T cells, thus leading to tumor infiltration by T cells and tumor regression rather than direct cytotoxic effects.30,31 Clinical observations of patients with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab, for example, suggested that conventional response assessment criteria such as RECIST and World Health Organization (WHO) criteria are not sufficient to fully characterize patterns of tumor response to immunotherapy because tumors treated with immunotherapeutic agents may show additional response patterns that are not described in these conventional criteria.32 Furthermore, the conventional tumor assessment criteria (RECIST and WHO criteria) have been reported as not capturing the existence of a subset of patients who have an OS similar to those who have experienced complete response (CR) or PR but were flagged as progressive disease (PD) by WHO criteria.32 On these grounds, a tumor assessment system has been developed that CCI incorporates these delayed or flare-type responses into RECIST v1.1 CCI Anti-tumor activity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline, 6 weeks after the first dose of therapy (Cycle 1 Day 1), every 6 weeks up to 1 year after the first dose of therapy, and then every 12 weeks therafter until documented disease progression regardless of initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. To understand the PK effects of avelumab on axitinib, a 7-day lead-in period with single-agent axitinib will be included prior to Cycle 1 in all patients in the Dose Finding Phase of the study. In this dosing algorithm, there are up to 3 potential dose levels (DL): (DL1) avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 5 mg BID, (DL-1A) avelumab 5 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 5 mg BID, and (DL-1B) avelumab 10 mg/kg Q2W + axitinib 3 mg BID. Possible Dose Finding Sequences Possible Sequences Starting with Dose Level 1 a) DL1 b) DL1  DL-1A and DL-1B c) DL1  DL-1A and DL-1B  DL1 DL: dose level Dosing will begin at DL1 and possibly be de-escalated to DL-1A and DL-1B according to Table 1 and Table 2. If the dose is de-escalated to DL-1A and DL-1B and the total number of patients then treated at DL-1A and DL-1B is 3, the following dosing rules are applied within each dose level:  0 DLTs (in DL-1A and DL-1B)  escalate back to DL1;  1 DLT (in either DL-1A or DL-1B)  remain at the same DL (DL-1);  2-3 DLTs (in either DL-1A or DL-1B) de-escalation not possible and depending on the distribution of the DLTs one or both doses at DL-1 will be considered intolerable.  If a patient withdraws from study treatment before receiving at least 75% of the planned first 2 cycles of axitinib or 2 infusions of avelumab for reasons other than study drug-related toxicity, another patient will be enrolled to replace that patient at the current dose level. For the purpose of dose finding, any of the following adverse events occurring during the primary DLT observation period (4 weeks, from the time of first administration of avelumab [Cycle 1 Day 1] until the planned administration of the third dose of avelumab [Cycle 3 Day 1]) that are attributable to one, the other, or both agents in combination will be classified as DLTs:  Hematologic:  Grade 4 anemia;  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days;  Febrile neutropenia, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000/mm3 with a single temperature of >38.3 degrees C (>101 degrees F) or a sustained temperature of 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) for more than 1 hour;  Grade 3 neutropenic infection;  Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding;  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia."
" this study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients receiving a subcutaneous injection or shot of tanezumab that was given under the skin every 8 weeks had the same safety and pain relief compared to patients taking a comparator medicine. in this study, the comparator medicine was tablets or capsules of nsaids that were to be taken twice a day. the nsaids were naproxen 500 mg, celecoxib 100 mg, or diclofenac er 75 mg. the study included patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee who were 18 years of age or older and who were taking nsaids for their osteoarthritis because acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) had not provided enough pain relief. the patient also had to be unable to take tramadol or opioids for pain relief or had tried these treatments but found they did not work, or was unwilling to take opioids. the patients and researchers did not know who took tanezumab and who took the comparator treatment in this study. this is known as a blinded study. studies such as this will often use a placebo to help evaluate drug effects. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being studied. in this study, placebo treatment was given as either an injection, tablets or capsules so that everyone in the study received an injection (tanezumab or placebo) every 8 weeks and tablets or capsules (placebo or nsaids) that they had to take twice a day. patients were put into 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance alone (see table below). this is known as a randomized study. putting people into groups by chance helps to make the groups more equal and easier to compare. while patients were only in the study for about 21 months (80 weeks), the entire study took over 3 and a half years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 307 locations in 17 countries in europe, north and south america, and in the asia-pacific area. it began on 21 july 2015 and ended on 27 february 2019. 1043 men and 1953 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 28 and 90 years. patients were to be treated for up to 56 weeks and this was then followed by a 24-week safety follow-up period when the patients were observed and no treatment was given (total of 80 weeks). of the 2996 patients who started the study and received at least 1 injection in the study, 1312 patients finished the treatment period and 1684 patients did not finish the treatment period. a total of 2227 patients completed the safety follow-up part of the study, whether or not they completed the treatment period. a total of 769 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. when the study ended in february 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

Radiographs of each shoulder, knee and hip (and any other major joint imaged at Screening or identified as at risk [refer to Section 7.4.4] during the study) should be performed as soon as possible after the decision to withdraw from the study has been made, provided at least 30 days have passed since the last set of X-rays were collected."
" this study compared 4 groups of patients to find out if patients taking tanezumab would have an improvement in chronic low back pain symptoms. to answer the research question, the researchers asked patients to rate their lower back pain each day, on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). the study included adult patients with chronic lower back pain that has been going on at least 3 months, who did not get adequate pain relief from certain other pain medicines. these patients had a back pain rating of 5 or more, on a scale from 0 to 10, at the beginning of the study. first, patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were appropriate to join the study. this was known as the screening period, which lasted up to 37 days. during this time, x-rays of the knees, hip joints, and shoulder joints were taken, and lower back pain was assessed. the next part of the study was the treatment period, which lasted up to 56 weeks. the treatments used in this study included:  tanezumab 5 mg, given as an injection under the skin every 8 weeks  tanezumab 10 mg, given as an injection under the skin every 8 weeks  a placebo that looks like tanezumab, given as an injection under the skin every 8 weeks  a medicine called tramadol that is used to treat chronic lower back pain, given as a pill by mouth every day  a placebo pill that looks like the tramadol pill, taken by mouth every day patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be compared. each group received the following treatments:  group 1: placebo injection + placebo pill for the first 16 weeks. after 16 weeks, patients were switched to tanezumab 5 mg or 10 mg injections, + placebo pill  group 2: tanezumab 5 mg injection + placebo pill  group 3: tanezumab 10 mg injection + placebo pill  group 4: tramadol pill + placebo injection the patients and researchers did not know who took the tanezumab injection or the placebo injection and who took the tramadol pill or the placebo pill, since these treatments looked the same. this is known as a blinded study. at study visits in the clinic, starting at the screening visit, the patients completed questionnaires about their low back pain. they also let the staff know about illnesses and discomforts, and had assessments (like physical exam, blood pressure, and more) done by the study doctors and other qualified personnel. during the study visits for week 16 and week 32, the study doctor assessed whether the patients should continue in the study, based on their low back pain ratings. to continue in the study, patients should have at least 30% improvement in pain ratings after 16 weeks of treatment. patients who did not have at least 30% improvement stopped study treatment and entered the follow-up period. the follow-up period lasted 24 weeks. during this time, the study doctors monitored the patients for any medical problems. the figure below shows what happened during this study. each patient participated in the study for up to 80 weeks, and the entire study took about 3 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 191 doctors offices and clinics in europe, asia, and north america. it began 18 august 2015 and ended 20 december 2018. 784 men (43%) and 1041 women (57%) participated. all patients were between the ages of 19 and 84. patients were to be treated for up to 56 weeks and complete the 24-week follow-up period. a total of 1825 patients joined the study and received study treatment. of these patients, 1181 (65%) finished the study. there were 644 patients (35%) who left before the study was over by their choice or because they had a medical problem and a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. when the study ended in december 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Study Schematic This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group Phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of tanezumab when administered by SC injection for up to 56 weeks in subjects with chronic low back pain. Approximately 1800 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 2:2:2:3 ratio (ie, 400 subjects per treatment group for the placebo, tanezumab 5 mg and tanezumab 10 mg treatment groups and 600 subjects in the tramadol PR treatment group). At the Week 16 visit, subjects in this group who meet the efficacy responder criteria described in Section 6.9.1 will be switched in a blinded fashion in a 1:1 ratio to either tanezumab 5 mg or tanezumab 10 mg administered SC at an 8 week interval plus placebo matching tramadol PR to Week 56; 2. The study is designed with a total duration (post-randomization) of up to 80 weeks and will consist of three periods: Screening (up to a maximum of 37 days; includes a Washout Period and an Initial Pain Assessment Period), a Double-blind Treatment Period (comprised of a 16-week Primary Efficacy Phase and a 40-week Long Term Safety and Efficacy Phase), and a Follow-up Period (24 weeks). The Screening Period (beginning up to 37 days prior to Randomization) includes a Washout Period (lasting 2-32 days), if required, and an Initial Pain Assessment Period (the 5 days prior to Randomization/Baseline). Prior to entering the study, subjects must have a documented history of previous inadequate treatment response to medications in 3 different categories of agents commonly used to treat and generally considered effective for the treatment of chronic low back pain. It is recommended that the radiographs required at Screening be obtained at least two weeks prior to the Baseline visit to permit Central Reader review of the images and to establish subject eligibility for initial dosing in the study. During the Washout Period and the Initial Pain Assessment Period, subjects will be provided with rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol) that may be taken, if necessary, up to a maximum daily dose of 3000 mg per day but the rescue medication must be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to the Baseline (Randomization) Visit. On a weekly basis beginning at the Initial Pain Assessment Period and through Week 80 of the study, the subject will be asked via IRT if he/she has experienced new or increased pain in a major joint (refer to Section 7.3.2). If a subject responds that he/she has experienced new or increased pain in a major joint (post-baseline), the subject will be asked to rate his/her pain in that joint on a 11-point numeric rating scale, using a 24-hour recall and will be asked to rate his/her pain in that joint for the remainder of the study. At the Week 16 visit, subjects must have at least a 30% reduction in average LBPI score relative to Baseline and at least a 15% reduction in average LBPI score relative to Baseline at any week from Week 1 to Week 15 in order to continue study treatment to Week 32. During the first 4 weeks of the treatment period (Baseline to Week 4), the tramadol PR dose may be adjusted as necessary every 5 to 7 days by 100 mg increments depending on pain relief or tolerability up to a maximum dose of tramadol PR 300 mg QD. These subjects will be switched in a 1:1 ratio to tanezumab 5 mg or tanezumab 10 mg SC plus matching placebo and will receive the first administration of SC tanezumab at Week 16. During the Primary Efficacy Phase, all concomitant medications for the treatment of chronic low back pain are prohibited with the exception of rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol) and study stable non-pharmacologic treatments (eg, massage, physical therapy) for chronic low back pain, but are prohibited from beginning new non-pharmacological treatments until after Week 16. The average LBPI score, rescue medication use, NSAID use, and joint pain assessments will be collected once a week via IRT, and safety and secondary efficacy assessments will be collected at study visits at Weeks 24, 32, 40, 48 and 56. X rays of the hips, knees, and shoulders as well as any additional joint that was imaged at Screening or identified as at risk (See Section 7.4.4) during the study will be obtained for all subjects at Weeks 24 and 56. Follow-up Period Subjects who complete the Week 56 visit will be considered to have completed the Double-blind Treatment period and will enter the 24-week Safety Follow-up period. Subjects that have completed the Double-blind Treatment period and have entered the 24-week Safety Follow-up period and complete the Week 80 visit will be considered to have completed the study. Subjects that do not complete the Double-blind Treatment period but who enter and complete the 24-week Early-termination follow-up period will be considered to have completed the study while those subjects who do not complete the 24-week Early-termination follow-up period will not be considered to have completed the study. With the completion of the Week 56 visit, the subjects will begin the 24-week Follow-up Period and will be asked to return to the clinic for 2 additional study visits. At that visit, all End of Study procedures are to be completed including X-rays of the hips, knees and shoulders as well as any additional joint that was imaged at Screening or identified as at risk during the study. The window for the Week 80 X-rays is 30 days of the nominal time of the visit but should be obtained as close as possible to the Week 80 visit, and preferably no more than 14 days after the Week 80 visit."
" this study compared 3 groups of children to find out if toddlers made immune system proteins, called antibodies, after taking bivalent rlp2086, and how the side effects compared to taking hav plus placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. children in both age groups were put into 1 of 3 study groups by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study, and is done to reduce differences between the study groups. reducing differences between groups makes comparing the groups more fair. in 2 of the 3 groups, children received the experimental vaccine bivalent rlp2086. one group received a 60 g dose of bivalent rlp2086, and the second group received a 120 g dose. the third group received hav and a placebo. about 64% (6 out of 10) of children received bivalent rlp2086 and 33% (3 of 10) received hav plus placebo. researchers used a placebo to see if the study medicine is safe and works better than not taking anything. the study included children who were aged 12 months to less than 24 months. this study was done in two stages. in stage 1, your child was followed for about 18 months. during stage 1, each child received 3 injections, at one of two different dose levels (60 g or 120 g) of investigational bivalent rlp2086, or hav and placebo. the injections were given at:  visit 1 (day 1)  visit 4 (month 2). children who were randomized to receive hav received a placebo (sterile saline) injection at this visit.  visit 6 (month 6) only children who were originally randomized to the bivalent rlp2086 group in stage 1 were eligible to be enrolled in stage 2 of the study. in stage 2, your child was followed for about 2 years. this stage measured how long the immune response lasted after the third vaccination with bivalent rlp2086. while patients were only in the the study for about 18 months, stage 1 of the study took 2 years to complete. patients joined the study at 1 of 25 locations in australia, czechia, finland, and poland. it began 31 august 2015 and is ongoing. 396 children participated. all children were between the ages of 12 months and 24 months. children were supposed to be treated until all vaccinations had been given. of the 396 children who started the study, 381 completed the study. 15 did not finish the study. all 15 children left before the study was over by their parents choice or because a doctor decided it was best for the child to stop the study. in august 2017, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Description The study is a Phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, observer-blinded, sponsor-unblinded, multicenter study in which approximately 396 healthy toddlers stratified by age, 12 to <18 months or 18 to <24 months old, will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 1 of 2 dose levels (60 g or 120 g) of bivalent rLP2086 or a licensed pediatric HAV vaccine (0.5 mL)/sterile saline solution for injection (0.85% sodium chloride) in a 0.5-mL dose. The expanded-enrollment phase will be open to subjects in 2 cohorts, one aged 12 to <18 months and the other aged 18 to <24 months. Within the study age cohort of 12 to <18 months, an additional subset of subjects aged 12 to <15 months is identified for the sentinel phase of the study. The designation of a subset of subjects aged 12 to <15 months aims to ensure that the sentinel cohort includes adequate enrollment of this youngest age cohort to support assessment of postvaccination reactions and AEs prior to the start of enrollment of the expanded-enrollment phase. 60-g Sentinel Cohort For each 60-g dose-level sentinel cohort, approximately 33 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 60 g of bivalent rLP2086 or HAV vaccine/saline. Within the 60-g sentinel cohort of each age group, when the last subject has received Vaccination 1 and has attended the Day 7 follow-up visit, all postVaccination 1, 7-day electronic diary (e-diary) and AE data (summary safety data) will be tabulated for review by the sponsors IRC. If the summary safety data 60-g dose are acceptable for the older-age sentinel cohort but not the younger-age sentinel cohort, then vaccination and enrollment will cease for the younger-age sentinel cohort only but enrollment may commence for the 120-g dose-level older-age sentinel cohort only. Within the 120-g sentinel cohort of each age group (if applicable), when the last subject has received Vaccination 1 and has attended the Day 7 follow-up visit, all postVaccination 1, 7-day e-diary and AE data (summary safety data) will be tabulated for review by the sponsors IRC. Following completion of the sentinel data review(s) of the 120-g dose, either the 60-g dose or the 120-g dose will be selected for each age cohort by the IRC for use in the expanded-enrollment phase of Stage 1. If the 120-g summary safety data are unacceptable in the younger-age sentinel cohort but acceptable in the older-age sentinel cohort, then a) vaccination and enrollment at the 120-g dose level will cease in the younger-age sentinel cohort, but vaccination and expanded enrollment may continue in the younger-age sentinel cohort at the 60-g dose level, and b) vaccination and expanded enrollment may continue at the 120-g dose level for the older-age sentinel cohort. Expanded Enrollment, Stage 1 The expanded-enrollment stage will enroll approximately 132 subjects each into 2 age groups (12 to <18 months and 18 to <24 months), randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the selected dose level of bivalent rLP2086 or HAV vaccine/saline. The selected dose level in the expanded-enrollment phase may differ between age groups (12 to <18 months and 18 to <24 months), but not within the substratum (12 to <15 months and 15 to 3.2.3. Approximately 33 subjects aged 12 to <15 months will be enrolled in a 60-g dose-level sentinel cohort, randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 60 g of bivalent rLP2086 or HAV vaccine/saline. When all subjects in the 12- to <15-months-of-age, 60-g sentinel cohort have received study Vaccination 1, the postVaccination 1, 7-day e-diary and AE data (summary safety data) will be collated for review by the IRC. If the IRC determines that the 60-g dose level should not continue in the 12- to <15-month sentinel cohort, and contingent upon a satisfactory tolerability, reactogenicity, and safety profile, an additional 165 expanded-enrollment subjects may be recruited into the 18- to <24-month age group at the selected dose level. When all subjects in the 12- to <15-months-of-age, 120-g sentinel cohort have received study Vaccination 1, the postVaccination 1, 7-day e-diary and AE data (summary safety data) will be collated for review by the IRC. Only when the IRC has determined that the summary safety data demonstrate a satisfactory tolerability, reactogenicity, and safety profile will the subjects in the 120-g sentinel cohort progress to complete the vaccination regimen with the 120-g vaccine dose or control as planned (Vaccinations 2 and 3). 60-g Sentinel Cohort Aged 18 to <24 Months Approximately 33 subjects aged 18 to <24 months will be enrolled in a 60-g dose-level sentinel cohort, randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 60 g of bivalent rLP2086 or HAV vaccine/saline. When all subjects in the 18- to <24-months-of-age, 60-g sentinel cohort have received study Vaccination 1, the postVaccination 1, 7-day e-diary and AE data (summary safety data) will be collated for review by the IRC. Only when the IRC has determined that the summary safety data demonstrate a satisfactory tolerability, reactogenicity, and safety profile will the subjects in the 60-g sentinel cohort progress to complete the vaccination regimen with the 60-g vaccine dose or control as planned (Vaccinations 2 and 3). Only when the IRC has determined that the summary safety data demonstrate a satisfactory tolerability, reactogenicity, and safety profile will the subjects in the 120-g sentinel cohort progress to complete the vaccination regimen with the 120-g vaccine dose or control as planned (Vaccinations 2 and 3)."
" this study consisted of 2 parts. in the first part of the study, all patients received treatment with the study drug 2 times per day, for 18 weeks. this was called the run-in phase. only the patients who had at least 30% improvement in their symptoms after the run-in phase took part in the second part of the study, called the double-blind phase. the double-blind phase of the study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if the study drug works to treat jia compared to placebo:  study drug (tofacitinib): 5 mg tablets or oral solution (1 mg/ml) 2 times per day  placebo: tablets or oral solution 2 times per day the study included patients with jia who were 2 years and older, but less than 18 years old. the patients jia symptoms had to start before they were 16 years old. patients were assigned to one of the 2 groups by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study. randomization is done to make comparing the groups more fair. the patients and researchers did not know who took the study drug and who took the placebo during the study. this is known as a blinded study. this was done to make sure the results of the study could not be unfairly influenced by anyone. in case of urgent need, the study team could learn quickly which study drug the patients were receiving. while each patient was only in the study for up to approximately 44 weeks, the entire study took almost 3 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 64 locations in 14 countries in different parts of the world. it began 10 june 2016 and ended 16 may 2019. in the run-in phase, 56 boys and 169 girls participated. in the double-blind phase, 43 boys and 130 girls participated. all patients were older than 2 and less than 18 years old. patients were to be treated until the end of the double-blind phase, or until their symptoms worsened. of the 225 patients who started the study, 185 finished the run-in phase. forty (40) patients left by their own choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. of the 185 patients who finished the run-in phase, 12 did not continue into the double-blind phase. of the 173 patients who started the double-blind phase of the study, 99 finished the double-blind phase. seventy-four (74) patients left by their own choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. when the study ended in may 2019, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects from 2 to <18 years of age with JIA (see Section 4.1, Inclusion Criteria). All eligible subjects enrolled in the study will initially receive open-label tofacitinib for 18 weeks (run-in phase). At the end of the 18 week run-in phase, only subjects who achieve at least a JIA ACR 30 response will be randomized to the 26 week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. Subjects who do not achieve a JIA ACR 30 response at this time point will be discontinued from the study. Subjects who experience a single episode of disease flare (see Section 7.1.7, PRCSG/PRINTO Disease Flare Criteria) at any time during the study (including the open-label run-in and double-blind phase) will also be discontinued from the study. Subjects who are eligible for the 26 week double-blind phase will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to either active tofacitinib or placebo. For subjects with polyarticular course JIA (ie, extended oligoarthritis, polyarthritis RF+, polyarthritis RF-, systemic JIA with active arthritis but without active systemic features), randomization will be stratified by JIA category and baseline CRP (normal, above normal). For subjects with psoriatic and enthesitis-related arthritis, randomization will be stratified by JIA category. A schematic of the study design is shown below: Approximately 210 subjects will be enrolled in the open-label run-in phase. Among subjects with polyarticular course JIA, stratification will target enrollment of at least 50% with a baseline CRP above the upper limit of normal. The cohort of subjects with polyarticular course JIA will have at least 170 subjects enrolled in the run-in phase with the minimum number of JIA categories as follows: 24 with extended oligoarthritis, 20 with polyarthritis RF+, and 62 with polyarthritis RF-. There is no minimum number of subjects with systemic JIA with active arthritis but without active systemic features. Additional cohorts (ie, psoriatic and enthesitis-related arthritis) will include a minimum of 20 subjects with psoriatic arthritis, and 20 subjects with enthesitis-related arthritis. The overall target minimum number of subjects to be enrolled in the study by age is as follows: 20 subjects 2 to <6 years, 20 subjects 6 to <12 years, and 20 subjects 12 to <18 years. The Sponsor will monitor enrollment and periodically notify investigator sites regarding the status of enrollment in the various JIA categories and age groups. Initial screening and enrollment of subjects (at least the first 12 subjects) into Study A3921104 must be limited to 12 years of age or greater for all eligible JIA subtypes (rheumatoid factor negative [RF-] and positive [RF+] polyarthritis, extended oligoarticular, psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis and systemic arthritis without systemic features JIA subtypes). The duration of subject participation among those who complete the study (without discontinuation) is expected to be approximately 44 weeks. Pediatric blood tubes will be used (reduced volume) for testing to determine eligibility, monitor safety, and measure PK. The study will be conducted over a period of approximately 3 years."
" this study provided palbociclib alongside letrozole therapy to all patients who entered the study as follows:  palbociclib 125 mg once a day for 21 days and then nothing for 7 days every 28-day cycle, and  letrozole 2.5 mg once a day throughout the study. the study provided access to palbociclib for patients who were post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (hr-positive) and human epidermal growth factor-negative (her2-negative) advanced breast cancer and who lived in argentina, brazil, colombia, and mexico. hr-positive and her2-negative breast cancer means that the cancer can grow and spread if certain hormones are present. hormones are chemicals produced in the body that carry messages from one area to another. if the chemical messenger comes into contact with the cancer cell, then sometimes, if the cancer is positive for that chemical messenger, the cancer will grow and spread. for patients in this study, their cancer would grow and spread if female hormones (estrogen and progesterone) were present in their blood. palbociclib is one option available to patients with hr-positive breast cancer. most patients (90%) in this study had been treated with a systemic anti-cancer therapies before they joined the study and received palbociclib. this included 35% who had been given 1 previous anti-cancer therapy, 20% who had been given 2 previous anti-cancer therapies, and 35% who had been given 3 or more previous anti-cancer therapies. while patients were in the study for an average of around 11 months, the entire study took over 4 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at sites in latin american countries (argentina, brazil, colombia, and mexico). it began 15 april 2016 and ended on 28 may 2019 and 131 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 28 and 83 years. of the 131 patients who started the study, 130 patients received treatment with palbociclib and letrozole and 1 patient left the study before being treated. the study was closed by the sponsor when palbociclib was approved by the regulatory authorities and doctors were able to prescribe this treatment for their patients. most patients left the study for this reason or because their cancer had progressed. when the study ended in may 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN A multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trial will be conducted in Mexico and in selected Latin American countries. Eligible patients will be postmenopausal women with HR-positive and HER2-negative ABC. Patients will have a histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast (locoregionally recurrent or metastatic disease) and will be candidates to receive letrozole for their advanced disease as first- or later lines of treatment. Approximately 130 patients will be enrolled. This total number of patients will allow for enrollment of an adequate number of patients from each participating country. Patients will continue to receive treatment with palbociclib until disease progression, symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, or time of commercial availability of palbociclib, whichever occurs first. Upon marketing approval of palbociclib by the local health authorities in the participating countries, patients enrolled in Study A5481053 will end participation in this study and be moved to commercially available palbociclib (if considered to be appropriate by the investigator), as soon as feasible. Patients will undergo AE monitoring as per local practice and per protocol. All grade, all- causality AEs and all serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded on the CRF. All deaths occurring up to 28 days after palbociclib is discontinued will be recorded. Hematology laboratory data will be recorded every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles of therapy, then monthly at the start of each cycle thereafter. In the case of Grade 3 neutropenia, consider repeating complete blood count monitoring 1 week later in accordance with best local practice and report on the CRF in order to document the level of neutropenia and the time to recovery of neutrophils to 1000 cells/mm3. Re-treatment criteria are based on time to recovery of neutrophil count. For patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, refer to the dose modifications described in Table 6. The clinical actions taken as a result of Grade 3 neutropenia, including the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), if any, should be recorded. Tumor response will be assessed as per local practice and only investigator tumor assessments will be collected. The date of tumor progression will be recorded. When patients are moved to commercial supply of palbociclib, their participation in the study and clinical study data collection will be discontinued."
" how was the study done? at the start of the study, participants were taking an opioid daily for mbp. when they began a study treatment, they kept on taking opioids at the same time. what were the study treatments?  tanezumab 20 mg  tanezumab 10 mg  placebo a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like tanezumab. the participants and researchers did not know who were given tanezumab and who were given the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. participants were assigned to a group by chance alone.  tanezumab 20 mg group: 72 participants were given tanezumab 20 mg.  tanezumab 10 mg group: 9 participants were given tanezumab 10 mg. in the middle of study, the sponsor removed the tanezumab 10 mg group.  tanezumab 10/20 mg group: 1 participant was first given tanezumab 10 mg, but was later switched to tanezumab 20 mg.  placebo group: 74 participants were given placebo. researchers compared the results of participants taking tanezumab to the results of those taking a placebo. the figure below shows what happened during the study. figure 1. what were the 3 parts of the study? screening period: treatment period: follow-up period: lasted up to 37 days lasted 24 weeks lasted 24 weeks study doctors and staff: participants were given a participantswere study treatment once every no longertaking a  checked the participants 8 weeks for a total of 3 times. study treatment. health and did tests to find out who could join study treatments: they had check-ups the study. by phone calls and  tanezumab 20 mg  made sure the opioid dose clinic visits.  tanezumab 10 mg helped to partly lessen  placebo mbpof participants.  checked if participants could endure the side effectsof the opioid dose. throughout the study: participants took an opioid daily for mbp. they took opioids by mouth or as a skin patch. they kept a record of their pain scores and medicines taken in a diary. they answered survey questions about their mbp. study doctors or staff checked the participants health. they asked participants how they were feeling and what medicines they were taking. they took x-rays of the participants hips, knees, and shoulders. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 48 study sites in 15 countries. the countries were in asia, europe, south america, and australia. when did this study take place? it began 28 october 2015 and ended 25 june 2021. who took part in this study? the study included adults who were at least 18 years old. they all had cancer with bone metastasis. the participants were taking an opioid every day to treat mbp. but, opioids gave them poor pain relief.  a total of 86 men and 69 women took part.  all participants were between 30 and 86 years old. out of 156 participants who started the study:  1 participant left the study before starting any study treatment.  155 participants were given a study treatment. out of the 155 participants: o 65 participants finished the study. o 90 participants did not finish the study. this was because of medical problems, death, or other reasons. most of the deaths were due to cancer that had gotten worse. how long did the study last? participants were in the study for 48 weeks. the entire study took 5 years and 8 months to complete. when the study ended in june 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

" this study included 3 groups of patients taking platinum-based chemotherapy with no maintenance treatment, platinum-based chemotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance treatment, or platinum-based chemotherapy given together with avelumab then followed by avelumab maintenance treatment. maintenance treatment means a treatment that is given to stop cancer from coming back after it has disappeared following an initial treatment. the study included adult women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer that had spread beyond the pelvis or throughout the body who had not yet received treatment for their advanced cancer. patients in this study must have had a surgery to remove as much cancer as possible. this was an open-label study, which means that both the patients and researchers knew which medicines were being given. potential patients were evaluated by the study doctor to make sure they met the criteria to participate in the study. this was known as the screening period, which lasted up to 28 days. next, eligible patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups:  group a (335 patients): platinum-based chemotherapy with no maintenance treatment  group b (332 patients): platinum-based chemotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance treatment  group c (331 patients): platinum-based chemotherapy given together with avelumab, then followed by avelumab maintenance treatment patients were assigned to each group by chance. putting people into groups by chance is called randomization. this helps make it more likely that the groups will be more even to compare. the chemotherapy combination of medicines used in this study was paclitaxel and carboplatin. all study treatments were given by intravenous (iv) infusion (a needle into a vein). during the chemotherapy phase, patients received carboplatin every 3 weeks and paclitaxel either every 1 week or every 3 weeks (patients doctor allowed to choose). patients in group c also received avelumab every 3 weeks during the chemotherapy phase. during the maintenance phase, patients in groups b and c received avelumab every 2 weeks, and patients in group a received observation only (no study treatments) during this time. the main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab) both during and/or after standard chemotherapy treatment would increase the amount of time it takes for ovarian cancer to worsen (progress). the study also evaluated the overall safety of avelumab alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy. after the last dose of study treatment, there was a 90-day follow-up period that included a monthly safety follow-up. there was a long-term follow-up period, which lasted until patients left the study or the study ended. the figure below shows what happened during this study. the amount of time that patients were in the study varied, but the entire study lasted about 3 years. the sponsor ran this study at 182 locations in 25 countries in asia, europe, and north america. it began on 19 may 2016. 998 women joined the study, and 991 women received study treatment. patients in the study were between the ages of 26 and 86. patients were expected to complete study treatment and a 90-day follow-up period, then enter the long-term follow-up period. the tables below show how many patients completed study treatment, and how many patients did not complete study treatment either by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. in september 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Study Overview This is a Phase 3, open-label, international, multi-center, efficacy, and safety study of avelumab in combination with and/or following platinum-based chemotherapy in adult patients with previously untreated EOC. In this Phase 3 trial, approximately 951 patients who are candidates for frontline platinum-based chemotherapy will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio stratified by paclitaxel regimen (Q3W vs QW); and by adjuvant (complete resection/microscopic disease) vs adjuvant (incomplete resection  1 cm) vs adjuvant (incomplete resection > 1 cm) vs  Arm A: platinum-based chemotherapy alone followed by observation  Arm B: platinum-based chemotherapy alone followed by avelumab maintenance  Arm C: avelumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance. The assignment to Arm A vs Arm B will be blinded at the time of randomization to patients, investigators, and the Sponsor until completion of chemotherapy as described in Section 5.1. Once a paclitaxel regimen is chosen for a given patient, it should not be changed for the duration of the study. The latter group will undergo interval debulking surgery after 3 study cycles of chemotherapy (plus or minus avelumab, depending on randomization) to be followed by the remainder of chemotherapy (plus or minus avelumab, depending on randomization). Study Design Schema Chemotherapy Maintenance Arm A Arm A Treatment Chemotherapy If SD, PR, Observation Until: Alone or CR after Progressive the Disease per completion RECIST v1.1 Arm B of Arm B Chemotherapy chemother Avelumab OR Alone apy (+/- avelumab) Unacceptable Toxicity Arm C Arm C Chemotherapy + Avelumab OR Avelumab Patient Withdrawal E1:C1O:1G 3.1.1. Safety Monitoring The initial evaluation of the safety of the combination of avelumab plus chemotherapy (Arm C) will be performed during the study as follows: Randomization to all 3 treatment arms will begin at the start of the study. After each of these 6 patients in Arm C has completed a minimum observation period of 4 weeks, the external data monitoring committee (E-DMC) will evaluate all available safety data. A second safety evaluation will be performed by the E-DMC after a total of 20 patients are enrolled on the chemotherapy plus avelumab combination arm (Arm C) and followed for at least 4 weeks without a patient enrollment hold in any arm. The frequency of subsequent E-DMC meetings for the entire study will be determined by the E-DMC at the time of this second safety evaluation (see Section 9.7). Study Treatment The study period includes two treatment phases, the chemotherapy phase and the maintenance phase. For purposes of consistent on-study assessments, 1 study cycle is defined as 3 weeks (21 days) for the chemotherapy phase, and 6 weeks (42 days) for the maintenance phase. In the chemotherapy phase of the study, study drugs will be assigned and given as follows: Arms A and B: The investigator will have the choice between weekly or Q3W paclitaxel: Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours, followed by carboplatin dose AUC 5 or AUC 6 as described in Section 5.3.2.2.2 IV over 1 hour on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for 6 cycles OR  Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on Days 1, 8 and 15 plus carboplatin AUC 5 or AUC 6 as described in Section 5.3.2.2.2 IV over 1 hour on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for 6 cycles Arm C:  Chemotherapy (investigators choice as referenced above) + avelumab 10 mg/kg administered as a 1-hour IV infusion once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. In patients who are enrolled prior to neoadjuvant therapy, the first 3 cycles will be administered prior to interval debulking surgery, and the remainder of chemotherapy will be administered after surgery. Upon completion of chemotherapy, patients without evidence of disease progression (SD, PR, or CR) will proceed to the maintenance phase of the study. The first visit of maintenance therapy will be numbered maintenance Cycle 1 Day 1 even if the last chemotherapy cycle was not completed. In the maintenance phase of the study, patients randomized to Arms B or C will receive avelumab 10 mg/kg administered as a 1-hour IV infusion once every 2 weeks. Patients who discontinue chemotherapy due to unacceptable toxicity will enter maintenance phase and will be on observation (Arm A) or receive avelumab (Arms B and C). Patients who discontinue avelumab due to unacceptable toxicity during the chemotherapy phase may complete chemotherapy and may enter the maintenance with observation only. Patients without evidence of disease progression by BICR assessment at the time of study treatment discontinuation should continue to undergo tumor assessment until documented radiographic progressive disease by BICR assessment, irrespective of the start of any new anticancer treatment. Patients who discontinue study treatment (or, if on Arm A maintenance observation, reach End of Treatment/Withdrawal) will be followed every 12 weeks for survival status until death or until study completion, whichever is earlier. Additionally the following data will be collected: surgery and/or new anti-cancer therapies including the date of initiation and discontinuation of each drug. Interval Debulking Surgery After Neoadjuvant Treatment Patients who are enrolled prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy will complete 3 cycles of chemotherapy (with avelumab in Arm C), then treatment will be held, and interval debulking surgery will be performed. According to institutional practice, upon recovery from surgery, the remainder of chemotherapy (with avelumab in Arm C) should be administered for a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy. In addition, radiological tumor assessments will also be conducted whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration or rising CA-125 levels), and at the time of End of Treatment/Withdrawal (if not done in the previous 12 weeks)."
" all the patients in this study had a dental extraction. the researchers divided the patients into 2 groups, and gave each group a different study treatment. one group took the study drug, which combines ibuprofen and acetaminophen together in the same tablet, and the other group took a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the study treatment. patients were picked for each treatment group by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study, and it helps make the treatment groups more even to compare. the patients and researchers did not know who took the study drug and who took the placebo. this is known as a double-blind study. researchers use this type of study to make sure that the results are not influenced in any way. after their dental extraction, the patients rested quietly at the study center. patients were given their first dose of study treatment once they reported having at least moderate pain. they received another dose of medicine every 8 hours for the next 48 hours. patients were also asked to rate their pain 20 times over the 48 hours following their dental extraction. the graph below shows what happened during this study. this study included healthy young adults who had at least 3 third molar teeth (wisdom teeth) extracted. third molar teeth are a type of teeth found in the back of the mouth. all patients were between the ages of 18 and 38 years old, and 56 men and 67 women participated in the study. while individual patients were only in the study for about 48 hours, the entire study took about 5 months to complete. patients joined the study at 1 location in the united states. it began 31 august 2016 and ended 1 february 2017. of the 123 patients who started the study, 112 completed it. eleven (11) patients did not finish the study by their own choice or because they had a medical problem. when the study ended in february 2017, the study sponsor (company that designed and paid for the study) began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This will be a Phase 3, 48-hour, single-center, in-patient, multiple-dose, fixed dosing interval, randomized, placebo-controlled, sex- and baseline pain severity-stratified, double-blind, parallel group trial in approximately 102 subjects (68 subjects for IBU/APAP 250 mg/500 mg group and 34 for placebo group [a ratio of 2:1]).

Subjects with a qualifying baseline pain threshold within approximately 5 hours of completion of surgery will be entered into the study. Upon completion of the baseline scales, eligible subjects will receive an oral dose of investigational product at 0 hours (baseline) and at 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 hours post-baseline under randomized, double-blind conditions. At 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 hours post-baseline, subjects will provide self-ratings of pain severity using the categorical and numerical PSRs. Subjects will also provide a self-rating of pain relief at each time point (except at baseline) using a categorical CCI scale. At 24 and 48 hours, or at the time of first rescue medication on each respective day, subjects will also complete a CCI of the investigational product. Additionally, subjects will also evaluate the time to CCI and time to meaningful relief using a double stopwatch method up to 8 hours post-baseline (ie, up to the second dose administration) or until the time of first rescue medication use, whichever is sooner. A review of any reported adverse events will also be completed."
" all 50 patients who were enrolled in this study received the investigational medicine. the study included men and women with moderate to severe uc who:  were between the ages of 18 and 75  were diagnosed with uc 4 or more months before entering the study  had active disease above the rectum (the lowest part of the large intestines)  were unable to tolerate, did not respond to, or lost response to at least 1 conventional therapy for uc (such as steroids, medications that suppress the immune system, or anti-tnf/anti-integrin inhibitors)  did not have another medical condition that could be made worse by treatment with the study medication this study consisted of a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. a diagram of the study is shown below. in this study, improvement in a patients uc was measured using a test called the mayo endoscopic subscore. this test measures how severe a patients uc is on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 being the best and 3 being the worst). improvement was defined as reaching a mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1. while patients were only in the study for 8 months, the entire study took 2 years to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 13 locations in 6 countries in north america, europe, and asia. it began on 26 october 2016 and ended 22 august 2018. 28 men and 22 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 20 and 68. patients were to be treated until 14 weeks after their last dose of the investigational medicine, or until 2 or more patients developed the same serious medical problem or an abnormal heartbeat. of the 50 patients who started the study, 42 finished the follow-up period. 1 patient did not finish the study because the study medication wasnt working, and 1 patient did not finish the study because of a medical problem. 6 patients left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. when the study ended in august 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Study Overview This is a Phase 2a, single arm, two-stage study in subjects with moderate to severe UC. Subjects will receive 500 mg of PF-06480605 intravenously Q2W for a total of 7 doses. At the end of the first stage (12 evaluable subjects with a Week 14 colonoscopy), an IA will be performed for an early efficacy assessment. Enrollment in the second stage will be stopped if the futility criteria are met and any ongoing subjects in the second stage will be moved to the follow-up period. Otherwise, the study will continue to enroll additional subjects in the second stage for final efficacy assessment. An early PK readout of PF-06480605 serum concentrations will be conducted after at least 6 subjects have completed the Week 4 visit to confirm that the predicted exposures of PF-06480605 in UC patients are consistent with expected values, based on the healthy subject PK data. Following this early PK readout analysis, dose may be modified to match the exposures observed in healthy volunteers receiving 500 mg/kg IV (Study B7541001). The study will include an additional research component involving collection of biological samples and planned analysis for de-identified exploratory biomarker and immunogenicity analysis. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will be eligible for this study provided these women use two highly effective methods of contraception, as outlined in Section 4.3. Stopping Rules Individual stopping rules will be implemented to further evaluate safety and feasibility of study continuation, as described below:  If 2 subjects receiving PF-06480605 develop the same adverse laboratory event with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V4.03) Grade 3 or higher, or if 1 subject develops a laboratory adverse event with a CTCAE Grade 4 or higher, then the study may be terminated.  If 2 subjects experience an ECG abnormality defined as a prolonged QTcF of >500 msec over baseline assessment, then the study may be terminated. If a single subject experiences a prolonged QTcF of >500 msec over baseline assessment, then this subject will be discontinued from the study. 3.2. Duration of Subject Participation The duration of participation for eligible subjects will be approximately 8 months, including a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a 12 week treatment period, and a follow-up period ending 14 weeks after the last dose of IP. Subjects with AEs as a result of positive ADA/NAbs may be requested to return for additional follow-up for up to 3 months after the follow-up/ EOS visit. During the treatment period, subjects will visit the site every 2 weeks (3 days) for IP administration (7 visits), and then will return to the site every 4 weeks (7 days) through Week 24 and again at Week 26, for follow-up visits (5 visits). 3.3. Approximate Duration of Study This study is estimated to complete in approximately 32 months, maximum, allowing for an estimated 18-24 months of enrollment and approximately 8 months on study. 3.4. Planned Number of Subjects This study has two stages. In the first stage, it is planned to have 12 evaluable subjects with an endoscopic score at Week 14 for futility assessment. If futility criteria are not met, recruitment will continue until approximately 36 total evaluable subjects complete the study with a final colonoscopy at Week 14."
" this study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if motor symptoms would decrease in patients taking pf-06649751, compared to patients taking placebo. the study included patients with early stage parkinsons disease who had motor symptoms. to be eligible to join the study, patients must not have used a dopamine medicine for longer than 28 days, or within 7 days of beginning the study. patients in this study were assigned to receive either pf-06649751 or placebo. the patients and researchers did not know who took pf-06649751 and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. patients were assigned to each treatment group by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study. putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more similar so they can be compared. first, patients were checked by a study doctor to make sure they met the requirements to join the study. this was called the screening period, which lasted 30 days. during the treatment period, which lasted 15 weeks, patients received either pf-06649751 or placebo. the treatment period included 2 parts:  9-week dose optimization period. during this part of the study, the dose was gradually increased each week, as tolerated by the patient. the target dose was 3 to 15 milligrams of pf-06649751 or matching placebo, taken each day.  6-week maintenance period. during this part of the study, patients were to receive the target dose of pf-06649751 or matching placebo each day. during the treatment period, patients had study appointment visits to be checked by study doctors to determine if motor symptoms were improving. patients were also asked about any medical problems they were having. finally, patients came to 2 follow-up visits after their last dose of pf-06649751 or placebo, at week 17 and week 19. this study ended early in january 2018, because another study that was being done with pf-06649751 did not show benefit for patients with parkinsons disease. so, the sponsor decided to stop this study, as well. however, patients who were already enrolled in the study were allowed to complete it. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. patients were in this study for up to 23 weeks, but the entire study took more than 15 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 23 locations in germany, france, israel, and the united states. it began 17 october 2016 and ended 29 january 2018. 34 men (60%) and 23 women (40%) joined the study and received study treatment. all patients were between the ages of 45 and 79 years. patients were to complete the 15-week treatment period and then enter a 28-day follow-up period. of the 57 patients who started the study and received study treatment, 54 patients (95%) completed the follow-up period. however, a total of 10 out of 57 patients (18%) stopped taking study treatment early by their choice or because they had a medical problem. when the study ended early in january 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Study Overview The study has a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose design. Approximately 88 subjects from approximately 30 centers in up to 5 countries will be randomized to 2 treatment groups (PF-06649751 or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio using a central randomization system. Each subject will undergo 15 weeks of double-blind treatment (including 9 weeks of Dose Optimization Period and 6 weeks of stable dosing during the Dose Maintenance Period). The 15 weeks of double-blind treatment will be preceded by a 30 day screening period. There will be an additional follow-up period of 28 days following discontinuation of investigational product. The overall study duration will be up to 23 weeks. During the initial up titration, subjects will gradually increase the dose of investigational product at weekly intervals, as tolerated, until Parkinsonian symptoms are optimally controlled. Investigational product will be self-administered once daily. The target dose range for PF-06649751 is 3 mg to 15 mg once daily (Stage 4  Stage 8 in Table 2). However, a maintenance dose less than 3 mg may be selected, based on clinical response. Adjustments to the up-titration schedule are permitted during the Dose Optimization Period based on clinical judgment to mitigate adverse events or symptoms of suspected dopaminergic overstimulation. Thereafter, any dose adjustment during the Maintenance Period (after Visit 10) may only be performed after discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor/Study Clinician. For both the PF-06649751 and placebo treatment arms, investigational product will be discontinued at Visit 14. 3.1.1. Screening Informed consent will be completed prior to any screening assessments to initiate any treatment washout period, if applicable. All other screening assessments will occur within 30 days prior to Visit 1 (Randomization). Rescreening may be permitted after discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor/Study Clinician. 3.1.2. Double Blind Period Eligible subjects will enter the 15 week double blind treatment phase, consisting of:  A 9 week Dose Optimization Period including:  Up titration of investigational product (PF-06649751 or placebo) administered once daily;  Period for stabilization after reaching an optimized dose.  A stable treatment period (Dose Maintenance Period) for 6 weeks. Subjects will return to the clinic each week during Visit 1 through Visit 4, and every other week thereafter during the Dose Optimization Period. Alternating phone visits will occur at every other week after Visit 4. During the Dose Maintenance Period, subjects will return to the clinic twice, at Visit 12 and Visit 14. Phone visits will be performed at Visit 11 and 13. Each subject is planned to be up-titrated in a double-blind fashion to the clinically appropriate dose level of investigational product according to Dose optimization of Investigational Product, Section 5.5.1. Following Visit 14, treatment with investigational product will be discontinued. 3.1.3. Follow-up Period A follow-up clinic visit approximately two weeks after discontinuation of investigational product (Visit 15) will take place for the assessment of subject safety. A follow-up phone visit will occur approximately 28 days after discontinuation of investigational product (Visit 16) for a final subject safety assessment."

" this study included boys with dmd who participated in a previous study (study b5161002) with domagrozumab. certain lab tests were done to make sure the boys were a good fit to join this study. the previous study (study b5161002) included 3 treatment groups, and was done in 2 parts: group 1:  part 1: domagrozumab starting at 5 milligrams per kilogram of weight (mg/kg), then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg  part 2: domagrozumab 40 mg/kg group 2:  part 1: domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg  part 2: placebo group 3:  part 1: placebo  part 2: domagrozumab starting at 5 mg/kg, then increased to 20 mg/kg, then to 40 mg/kg a placebo looks just like the medicine, but doesnt have any medicine in it. this was an open-label study, which means that the boys, their parents, and the researchers knew what medicine and dose the boys received during the study. all boys in this study received domagrozumab at a dose of 40 mg/kg, given once per month. domagrozumab was given as an iv infusion, which means that a needle is placed in the vein and the study drug slowly drips into the vein. when boys came to study visits, lab tests, x-rays, physical examinations, and other tests were done, and they were asked about any medical problems. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. this study was planned to last up to 4 years. however, the sponsor decided to stop the study early in november 2018, because results from the previous study did not show that boys benefited from taking domagrozumab. on average, boys were in the study for about 10 months, but the entire study lasted about 2 years. the sponsor ran this study at 22 locations in canada, italy, japan, united kingdom, and united states. it began 13 october 2016 and ended 22 november 2018. all 59 participants were boys between the ages of 7 and 11. boys were to be treated for up to 4 years. of the 59 boys who entered the study, no boys (0%) completed it. 55 boys (93%) left the study when the sponsor decided to stop it early. additionally, 3 boys (5%) did not complete the study by their choice or their parents choice, and 1 boy (2%) passed away for a reason not related to taking domagrozumab. the sponsor decided to stop the study early in november 2018, because results did not show that boys benefited from taking domagrozumab. after the study ended, the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. what medical problems did boys have during the study? the researchers recorded any medical problems the boys had during the study. boys could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the boy was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. 49 out of 59 boys (83%) in this study had at least 1 medical problem. the most common medical problems are listed below. edical oblem ll eadache mmon miting osebleed ver fection se, per uffy u hroat ck omach arrhea uise ugh in unny oken g asonal researchers also found that:  no boys in this study had medical problems that caused them to temporarily stop taking domagrozumab, or that caused the dose of domagrozumab to be lowered.  most of the medical problems that happened during this study were considered to be mild in severity. 4 boys (7%) had medical problems that were considered to be severe.  6 boys (10%) had medical problems that were considered to be related to taking domagrozumab. these medical problems were considered to be mild in severity.  1 boy (2%) left this study and passed away because of a medical problem. this medical problem was not considered to be related to taking domagrozumab.  findings from lab studies, physical examination, x-rays, and other tests were used to learn more about the safety of domagrozumab. in this study, no long-term safety issues were associated with taking domagrozumab. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. were there any serious medical problems? a medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. 5 boys in this study (9%) had serious medical problems. 1 boy passed away for a reason not related to taking domagrozumab. the serious medical problems are listed below. where can i learn more about this study?

STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Study Overview This is a Phase 2 OLE to protocol B5161002 and will provide an assessment of the long term safety, efficacy, PD and PK of IV dosing of PF-06252616 in boys with DMD. The individual dose level selected for each subject will be based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from the parent study B5161002. However, dose levels may be adjusted based on emerging safety or efficacy data from B5161002. Subjects will be dosed with one of three PF-06252616 dose levels:  5 mg/kg  20 mg/kg  40 mg/kg Approximately 105 eligible subjects will be assigned to receive an individualized MTD based on their tolerability profile/data from B5161002. No placebo comparator will be assessed. Consenting subjects who complete the B5161002 study will be invited to transition directly to the OLE study. Subjects results from the B5161002 study may be used as screening data for the current study if the subject is enrolled within 42 days of Week 97 visit of B5161002, see Schedule of Activities and Assessments for details. If this window is exceeded, the sponsor and investigator will assess if the subject may still participate in this OLE study, and which, if any, assessments must be completed to confirm eligibility. 3.2. Duration of Study and Subject Participation The OLE study is planned to be conducted over a period of 4 years. The end of the study will be the last visit of the last subject for purposes of closing out sites, informing the institutional review board/ethics committee (IRB/EC), and ceasing to send Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) reports. Depending on when subjects begin the OLE study, their participation may be as long as 4 years. Subjects may be withdrawn from the OLE study should the parent study, B5161002 fail to meet its planned study objectives, is terminated early for other reasons (eg, sponsor decision) or the drug is commercialized. Subjects will be administered monthly infusions of study drug as well as completion of safety and efficacy assessments as per the Schedule of Activities. In the case where subjects are traveling from a distance, local overnight accommodation will be offered. 3.3. Planned Number of Subjects Approximately 105 subjects will participate in multiple centers and countries worldwide. 3.4. Safety Monitoring and the E-DMC From the time of study initiation through completion of the study, the sponsor will conduct routine safety monitoring of the data per the safety review plans. In addition, the E-DMC will periodically review safety data as outlined in Section 3.4.1. 3.4.1. External Data Monitoring Committee (E-DMC) The E-DMC will include experts in the field of neuromuscular diseases and/or statistics. Members of the E-DMC will not be Pfizer employees. The E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing efficacy and safety monitoring and its reviews will include aggregate safety, targeted medical events of special interest including liver toxicity, and serious adverse event (SAE) data. Additional ad hoc safety reviews may be performed as described in the E-DMC charter. Following each data review, the E-DMC will provide a recommendation to the sponsor management to continue the study, modify the study and then continue (eg, but not limited to terminate a dose level, remove the liver MRI or other monitoring assessments), or stop the study (eg, due to safety). The recommendations made by the E-DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to the sponsor management for final decision. The sponsor management will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. At any time the E-DMC may indicate that the limit of safety and/or tolerability has been reached and that any of the dose levels will be removed from the study. Additional details of the type, timing and responsibilities of the E-DMC will be included in the E-DMC charter."
" how was the study done? researchers studied a group of participants to learn more about the safety of talazoparib when used long term. participants with advanced solid tumors who had previously completed a study of talazoparib were invited to join this study. participants received talazoparib once per day by mouth, and were monitored for any medical problems. the starting dose was up to 1 milligram (mg) per day, or the last dose they were able to tolerate in their previous study. participants could continue receiving talazoparib as long as it continued to benefit them, and participants were followed up for 30 days after their last dose of talazoparib. this was an open-label study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose the participants received. the figure below shows what happened during the study. where did this study take place? the study was conducted at 24 locations in 9 countries in north america, europe, and central asia. when did this study take place? it began 08 november 2016 and ended 20 july 2021. who participated in this study? this study included adult men and women who had participated in a previous study of talazoparib in advanced solid tumors, and who were able to tolerate a dose of at least 0.25 milligrams (mg) per day.  a total of 37 men (31%) participated  a total of 83 women (69%) participated  all participants were between the ages of 20 and 93 years a total of 120 participants joined the study, and 118 participants (98%) received talazoparib. the reasons for stopping talazoparib treatment were:  medical problem: 10 participants (8%)  doctor decision: 5 participants (4%)  worsening cancer: 85 participants (71%)  participant decision: 6 participants (5%)  lost contact with participant: 1 participant (1%)  other reason: 11 participants (9%) how long did the study last? the amount of time that participants were in this study varied. the median (middle) amount of time that participants received talazoparib during this study was 3.7 months. the entire study took almost 5 years to complete. when the study ended in july 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. what medical problems did participants have during the study? the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by the study treatment or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study medication might have on a participant. a total of 110 out of 118 (93%) treated participants had at least 1 medical problem. nine (8%) participants stopped taking talazoparib because of medical problems. the most common medical problems  those reported by at least 10% of participants  are described below. below are instructions for understanding table 1. instructions for understanding table 1.  the 1st column of table 1 lists medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all medical problems reported by at least 10% of participants are listed.  the 2nd column tells how many of the 118 participants treated with talazoparib reported each medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 118 participants treated with talazoparib who reported the medical problem.  using these instructions, you can see that for 39 out of the 118 (33%) participants treated with talazoparib, a low number of red blood cells was reported as a medical problem.  did study participants have any serious medical problems? a medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. a total of 45 out of 118 (38%) treated participants had serious medical problems. the most common serious medical problems  those reported by at least 2% of participants  are described below. below are instructions for understanding table 2. instructions for understanding table 2.  the 1st column of table 2 lists serious medical problems that were commonly reported during the study. all serious medical problems reported by at least 2% of participants are listed.  the 2nd column tells how many of the 118 participants treated with talazoparib reported each serious medical problem. next to this number is the percentage of the 118 participants treated with talazoparib who reported the serious medical problem.  using these instructions, you can see that for 4 out of the 118 (3%) participants treated with talazoparib, a low number of red blood cells was reported as a serious medical problem. a total of 15 out of 118 (13%) treated participants died during this study. worsening cancer was the most common cause of death. no deaths were considered by the study doctors to be related to talazoparib. where can i learn more about this study?

" how was the study done? researchers tested various doses of ritlecitinib or brepocitinib on groups of study participants to find out if study participants taking these study medicines experienced relief from their uc symptoms.  ritlecitinib (total of 150 participants): o 51 participants received 20 mg o 49 participants received 70 mg o 50 participants received 200 mg  brepocitinib (total of 142 participants): o 48 participants received 10 mg o 47 participants received 30 mg o 47 participants received 60 mg  placebo (total of 25 participants) the study participants and researchers did not know who took ritlecitinib or brepocitinib and who took the placebo. this is known as a double-blinded study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. researchers measured the symptom relief of uc for each treatment group by using a mayo score. this is a scoring system that measures how many stools were passed each day, amount of rectal bleeding (if any), mucosal appearance (doctors use a camera on the end of a tube to look at the inside lining of the colon), and a rating of the disease by a doctor (normal, mild, moderate or severe). the mayo score ranges from 0 to 12:  mayo score 0 to 2: participant is in remission (no disease activity)  mayo score 3 to 5: participant has mild disease  mayo score 6 to 10: participant has moderate disease  mayo score 10 and higher: participant has severe disease all participants in the study started with moderate to severe uc according to their mayo score. the difference in their score after the induction period would indicate how effective the study treatment was. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 154 locations in 19 countries (united states, australia, bulgaria, czech republic, denmark, georgia, germany, hungary, israel, italy, republic of korea, romania, russian federation, serbia, slovakia, spain, poland, turkey and ukraine). when did this study take place? it began 03 february 2017 and ended 10 may 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who had moderate to severe uc, even although they had tried other treatments.  a total of 182 men participated  a total of 135 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 18 and 73. participants were to be treated in the induction period for 8 weeks. of the 317 participants who started the study, 281 finished the induction phase. ten (10) participants in the ritlecitinib group, 4 participants in the brepocitinib group, and zero participants in the placebo group, did not finish the induction phase because of medical problems. overall, 36 participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. how long did the study last? study participants were in the induction phase of the study for 8 weeks. the entire study took 51 months to complete. the study was completed as planned. when the study ended in may 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Study Overview This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (in the induction period and not in the chronic dosing period), parallel group, multicenter study in subjects with moderate to severe active UC. The first part of the study is a screening period of up to 6 weeks followed by an 8 week double-blind induction period. The study will not be blinded across the PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 cohorts, but will be placebo-controlled during the induction phase, and double-blinded within each investigational product. At Week 8, all subjects will be assigned to their respective treatment cohort (PF-06651600 or PF-06700841) into an additional 24 week active chronic dosing period followed by a 4 week follow up period after the last dose of investigational product for a total of 36 weeks. The chronic dosing period is in effect open label, with both subjects and Investigators aware that they have been assigned to PF-06651600 or PF-06700841, and that there is no placebo control. Approximately 318 subjects in total will be randomized into the study. Following the screening period, subjects who meet the eligibility criteria at the baseline visit will be randomly assigned to receive one of 8 treatments. In the induction period, three oral dose levels (20, 70, and 200 mg daily) of PF-06651600 plus matching placebo in a 4:4:4:1 ratio and three oral doses (10, 30, and 60 mg daily) of PF-06700841 plus matching placebo in a 4:4:4:1 ratio will be investigated. For analysis of the induction period, placebo groups will be combined to yield final drug: placebo ratios of 2:2:2:1 for each drug at week 8. Following the induction period of the study, all subjects will enter the chronic dosing period in which there will be no placebo arms (Protocol Amendments 5, 6, 7). All subjects (including placebo subjects) from the double-blind PF-06651600 treatment/placebo induction period will receive 50 mg of PF-06651600 for 24 weeks. All subjects (including placebo subjects) from the double-blind PF-06700841/placebo induction period will receive 30 mg of PF-06700841 for 24 weeks. Prior to Amendment 5, subjects were assigned to placebo and active during the chronic period within their respective treatment using a 2:1 ratio. Any subject who discontinues early from the induction period prior to the Week 8 visit should undergo the procedures for an Early Termination visit on the last day the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible thereafter, and will not be permitted to enter the chronic dosing period. For subjects who discontinue early from the chronic dosing period (after the Week 8 visit, but prior to the Week 32 visit), the procedures scheduled for an Early Termination visit will be performed on the last day the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible thereafter. After completion of the Early Termination visit subjects will enter the follow-up period. 3.2. Duration of Subject Participation The duration of participation for eligible subjects will be approximately 42 weeks. This includes a screening period of up to 6 weeks, an 8 week double-blind induction period followed by a 24 week open label chronic dosing period and a 4 week follow up visit after 3.3. Approximate Duration of Study The study is estimated to complete in approximately 50 months, allowing for an estimated 40 months to complete enrollment with each subject remaining on study for approximately 10 months."
" this study compared patients taking different dose strengths of pf-06700841 to patients taking placebo, to find out if they would have an improvement in psoriasis symptoms. the study included adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. the patients and researchers did not know who took pf-06700841 and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. putting people into groups by chance helps to make the groups easier to compare. first, patients were checked by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to join the study. this was known as the screening period, which could last up to 6 weeks. during the first part of the treatment period, which lasted 4 weeks, patients received 1 of 3 possible treatments:  30 mg pf-06700841, taken once per day (qd)  60 mg pf-06700841, qd  placebo, qd during the second part of the treatment period, which lasted 8 weeks, patients were switched to 1 of 4 possible treatments:  10 mg pf-06700841, qd  30 mg pf-06700841, qd  100 mg pf-06700841, taken once per week (qw). these patients also received a placebo medicine on the days that they did not take pf-06700841, so that the study would stay blinded.  placebo, qd the last part of the study was a follow-up period, which lasted for 8 weeks after the patients finished taking study treatment. the figure on the following page shows what happened during this study. while patients were only in the study for up to 26 weeks, the entire study took more than 15 months to complete, because patients joined the study at different times. the sponsor ran this study at 34 locations in canada, poland, and the united states. it began 01 december 2016 and ended 19 march 2018. 148 men (70%) and 64 women (30%) participated. all patients were between the ages of 18 and 75. patients were to be treated for 12 weeks and complete the 8-week follow-up period. of the 212 patients who started the study, 164 finished the study. a total of 48 patients left before the study was over by their choice, because they had a medical problem, or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. when the study ended in march 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The first part of the study, following a screening period (up to 6 weeks), is a 4 week induction period with double blind daily treatment. At the end of Week 4, all subjects switch to their predefined double blind maintenance treatment regimen for Week 5 through Week 12. Approximately 200 subjects are planned to be randomized into the study, to allow for approximately 160 evaluable subjects (20 completers per arm). The randomization ratio will be 7:1, active: placebo. During the first 4 week treatment period, 2 oral daily dose levels (30 mg and 60 mg) of PF-06700841, plus matching placebo, will be investigated. During the 8 week maintenance treatment period (Weeks 5 through 12), subjects will receive either 10 mg or 30 mg PF-06700841 once daily, or a 100 mg once weekly regimen of PF-06700841, or matching placebo. Maintenance dose level and regimen will be assigned at the initial time of randomization into the study. All subjects, regardless of assigned regimen (ie, QD or QW) will receive blinded QD dosing throughout the study treatment period to maintain the study blind. The duration of study subject participation will be approximately 26 weeks, including screening, 12 week treatment period, and 8 week follow up period. Figure 1. Study Schematic"
" this study compared 2 groups of patients taking either pf-06651600 or placebo, to find out if they would have an improvement in ra. the study included adult patients with ra who had tried certain other ra medicines, such as methotrexate, but did not get did adequate relief. the patients and researchers did not know who took pf-06651600 and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. first, patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were a good fit to join the study. this was known as the screening period, which lasted up to 5 weeks. next, patients were assigned to receive either pf-06651600 200 milligrams (mg) or placebo. the medicines were taken by mouth every day for 8 weeks. during this time, patients were to continue taking methotrexate and certain other medicines, as prescribed by their doctor. patients were assigned to each group by chance alone. putting people into groups by chance helps make the groups more even to compare. after patients completed study treatment, there was a follow-up period that lasted for 4 weeks. the figure below shows what happened during this study. while patients were only in the study for about 12 weeks (treatment plus follow-up), the entire study took about 1 year to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 32 locations in 9 countries in europe and north america. it began 20 december 2016 and ended 12 december 2017. 13 men (19%) and 57 women (81%) participated. all patients were between the ages of 24 and 74. patients were to be treated for 8 weeks then complete the 4 week follow-up period. of the 70 patients who started the study, 59 (84%) finished it. 11 patients (16%) left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. when the study ended in december 2017, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

This is a Phase 2a, 8 week randomized double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety profile of PF-06651600 in seropositive subjects with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to methotrexate (up to approximately 50% of subjects may also have had an inadequate response to 1 anti-TNF biologic DMARD). Up to approximately 60 subjects may be randomized globally into the study to ensure at least approximately 50 subjects complete 8 weeks of active dosing (assuming a dropout rate of approximately 15%). Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 17 weeks. This includes an up to 5-week screening period, an 8 week treatment period, and a 4 week follow-up period. After an up to 5 week screening period, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive 200 mg QD of PF-06651600 or placebo (matching tablets for PF-06651600 QD) every day for 8 weeks in a blinded fashion. Subjects will remain on stable background arthritis therapy, which must include methotrexate (supplemented with folic/folinic acid per local treatment guidelines). Subjects additionally may continue stable doses of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), COX-2 inhibitors, allowed opioids (at doses  the potency equivalent of 30 mg of orally-administered morphine), acetaminophen/paracetamol for pain control (2.6 grams per day), and/or low dose oral corticosteroids (10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Methotrexate must have been dosed orally for at least 3 months, the dose must have been stable for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study drug, and the dose must remain stable during the study. Allowed methotrexate doses are 15 to 25 mg, inclusive, weekly, unless there is documented (in the source documentation) intolerance to or toxicity from these doses, in which case a dose between 10 and <15 mg, inclusive, may be used. Folic or folinic acid must be dosed per local standards of care stably for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study drug. NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, allowed opioids and/or low dose oral corticosteroids (10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) must be dosed stably for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug (See Section 5.8)."
" this study included 4 groups of patients given an injection of marstacimab at different doses. this was done to see if patients had any medical problems after this treatment and also see if this treatment could prevent bleeding episodes. the 4 groups and the different doses of marstacimab that were given in this study are shown in the following table. a it was planned that 6 patients would be included in group 1 and while 8 were enrolled only 7 patients were treated with marstacimab as 1 withdrew their consent before receiving treatment. b patients with inhibitors to their factor replacement therapy could only join group 4. the study included patients who had severe hemophilia a or b, with or without inhibitors. some patients with hemophilia can develop inhibitors in their blood to the proteins in factor replacement therapy. these inhibitors stop the clotting factors in the factor replacement therapy from working. this means that people with hemophilia who have these inhibitors may have more severe bleeds and may need higher doses of factor replacement therapy or alternative treatment(s) to stop any bleeding. patients with inhibitors to their factor replacement therapy were only able to join group 4. this was an open-label study, so everyone, including the patient, knew what treatment was given to each group. while patients were only in the study for 5 months, the entire study took 21 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 8 locations in 6 countries in north america, south america, europe and south africa. it began 08 march 2017 and ended 03 december 2018. 27 men participated and 26 were treated with marstacimab (1 patient decided he did not want to be treated with marstacimab before being given his first injection). all patients were between the ages of 19 and 63 years. the 7 patients in group 1 were treated first and were given 1 injection of marstacimab each week so that they received 5 injections of marstacimab. if these patients did not have many medical problems after 4 weeks, the 6 patients in group 2 were treated. if the 6 patients in group 2 did not have many medical problems after 4 weeks, then the 6 patients in group 3 were treated. if the 6 patients in group 3 did not have many medical problems after 4 weeks, then the 7 patients in group 4 were treated. patients were to be treated once a week for up to 3 months. of the 26 patients who started the study, 24 (92%) finished the study and 2 (8%) did not finish the study because of medical problems. when the study ended in december 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN B7841002 will be an open-label investigation of the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of multiple SC or IV doses of PF-06741086 in males with hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors to FVIII or FIX. Subjects with severe hemophilia A or B (defined by factor VIII or factor IX activity 1%), including subjects with inhibitors to factor VIII or factor IX (positive inhibitor test result [above the upper limit of normal]), who receive bypass agents as primary treatment for bleeding episodes) will be recruited into B7841002. Subjects with inhibitors who are currently treated with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC, eg, FEIBA) and cannot substitute treatment with recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, eptacog alfa [activated]) as their standard of care for treatment of acute bleeding episodes (at a dose level of approximately 90 g/kg) for the duration of the study are not eligible. Subjects must be on an episodic (on-demand) treatment regimen at the time of study enrollment and also have a documented history of at least 6 acute bleeding episodes in the 6 months prior to study enrollment. Subjects with inhibitors to FVIII or FIX will only be enrolled into a cohort with a dose level and regimen that was previously assessed as safe and well tolerated in subjects without inhibitors. Additional subjects and/or cohorts may be enrolled in the event that the number of dosing cohorts or size of dosing cohorts is increased to fully define the dose range and/or clinical profile at the respective dose levels. Study Duration Subjects will be screened within 35 days prior to administration of the investigational product to confirm that they meet the subject eligibility criteria for the study. Following Day 29, provided that safety was confirmed for the cohort and no stopping criteria were met, all subjects in each cohort will return to the clinic for PK/PD sample collection on Day 30 and Day 33. Subjects who experience a treatment-related adverse event (including lab abnormalities) at any time point will continue to be followed through resolution or stabilization of the event as agreed upon by the investigator and Sponsor. Dose limiting toxicities are defined as:  Treatment emergent laboratory abnormality as specified in Appendix 2;  Treatment emergent vital sign abnormality as specified in Appendix 2;  Treatment emergent ECG abnormality as specified in Appendix 2;  Treatment emergent severe or  Grade 3 adverse event, as graded by the NIAID DMID criteria for severity unless incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes. Additional rules governing dose escalation are as follows:  Dosing at the current dose level (or higher dose levels) will be suspended for any treatment emergent thrombotic event (see Appendix 1 for qualifying AEs) in a subject receiving PF-06741086 to permit characterization of the respective event and communication to regulatory agencies where required. Vessel occlusion related to the insertion or presence of a central venous catheter may be excluded from this criterion after review of the AE with the respective investigator to assess causality and/or clinical significance.  All treatment emergent adverse events, regardless of system organ class, severity/grade, causality, and/or attribution to treatment with PF-06741086 are assessed and it is determined by the Sponsor that the limit of safety and/or tolerability has been reached. Dose escalation will cease if the SAE is determined to be either drug-related or unknown, and may resume if the SAE is determined to be not drug-related by the Sponsor.  If, based on the observed data, the group geometric mean C or area under the curve max (AUC ) (based on total concentration with either the first dose or at steady-state) of 168 the next planned regimen is projected to exceed the exposure limits (AUC of 168 1,940,000 gh/mL and C of 27,800 g/mL), that dose will not be explored. Progression to a higher dose level or regimen not assessed as safe and well tolerated in a previous cohort will follow the Sponsors review of the available safety, PK, PD, and bleed rate data through study Day 29 (at a minimum) in 100% (ie, 6 of 6) of subjects in the current cohort. Dose Modifications Any subject who experiences a dose limiting toxicity (per Appendix 2) will be discontinued from treatment with the investigational product and will be followed for adverse event monitoring until resolution of the respective toxicity and elimination of study drug or the end of the study (Day 113) and resolution or stabilization of the respective toxicity, whichever occurs first. In addition, subjects who have not experienced dose limiting toxicities but are currently receiving a dose that met the dose limiting toxicities criteria for termination of dose escalation as defined in Section 3.3 will be removed from the current dose level and dropped to the next lowest exposure level. Criteria for modifications of dosing in an individual subject are as follows:  Moderate severity infusion/injection site reactions at more than 2 consecutive visits (eg, Day 22, Day 29, and Day 36);  Treatment emergent adverse event(s) that increases in severity/grade, without resolution, (eg, Mild to Moderate and continuing) after repeat administration of PF-06741086;  Treatment emergent adverse event(s) of any severity with more than 2 occurrences following repeat administration of PF-06741086. Any subject who meets the above criteria during treatment with PF-06741086 will be removed from the current dose level and dropped to the next lowest exposure level, unless the event(s) are incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes or are incontrovertibly complications of hemophilia (see Section 8.6 for qualifying events)."
" this study compared 6 groups of patients to find out if pf-06650833 given at 4 different doses works to treat ra compared to patients taking a placebo or a comparator medicine of tofacitinib (see figure and table). a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. the patients and the doctors did not know who was given which treatment/medicine and at what dose in this study. this is known as a double-blinded study. this was done to make sure that the trial results were not influenced in any way. volunteers were assigned to each group by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups more similar, which makes comparing the groups more fair.  a all tablets were identical in appearance. the study included adult patients with moderate to severe active ra. all the patients in this study were already taking methotrexate, but still had active ra symptoms. in addition to methotrexate, the patient could have been previously treated with an anti- tumor necrosis factor (anti-tnf). this is a particular kind of treatment that specifically inhibits the activity of chemicals in the body known as tnfs. inhibits means that activity of a chemical is slowed down, reduced, or stopped. anti-tnf treatment is used in ra to help control the disease and reduce pain and disability. the anti-tnf treatment could have been stopped because of safety concerns, if it did not seem to give sufficient help to the patient, or if the patient was not able to obtain the treatment due to access problems. in addition to study medication (pf-06650833 plus placebo or tofacitinib plus placebo), patients could take their normal treatments for ra including methotrexate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 inhibitors, some types of opioid and/or acetaminophen (paracetamol) for pain relief and/or a low dose of oral corticosteroids like prednisone. while each patient was only in the study for 20 weeks, the entire study took 21 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 103 locations in 19 countries in asia, europe, central america, north america, and oceania. it began on 10 november 2016 and ended on 15 august 2018. 59 men and 210 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 19 and 73 years. patients were to be treated for 12 weeks. of the 269 patients who started the study, 237 finished the study (e.g., 12 weeks of treatment plus 4 weeks of follow up). during the follow-up period, patients were not given treatment but were only monitored for possible safety events. there were 32 patients who left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop the study. of these 32 patients, 27 patients did not complete the 12 weeks of treatment and 5 patients completed the 12 weeks of treatment, but did not completed the 4 weeks of follow- up. when the study ended in august 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

The TNF-inhibiting biologic could have been discontinued due to its being deemed inadequately effective and/or not tolerated as defined, for the purpose of this study, by the Investigators and subjects opinions that the subject did not experience adequate benefit from the anti-TNF plus the presence of sufficient residual disease activity to meet the entry criteria. The anti-TNF biologic could also have been discontinued due to lack of continued access. After an up to 28 day screening period, eligible subjects in regions where tofacitinibs inclusion as an active control is accepted by local regulatory authorities and ethics committees will be randomized in to receive 1 of 4 dose regimens of PF-06650833 (400 mg, 200 mg, 60 mg, 20 mg MR tablets QD), tofacitinib 5 mg BID, or placebo (matching MR tablets for PF-06650833 QD and matching tofacitinib tablets BID) in a 6 : 6 : 6 : 5 : 5 : 5 ratio in a blinded fashion (Figure 2). In order to maintain the blind and minimize bias, all subjects will receive the same number and types of tablets each day. Subjects assigned to PF-06650833 will all take 4 MR tablets, consisting of a mixture of active PF-06650833 and/or matching placebo tablets dispensed in a blister pack, once per day. In countries in which regulatory authorities and ethics committes accept the use of tofacitinib as an active control in this trial, subjects also will take 1 matching tofacitinib placebo tablet (dispensed in bottles) BID. Subjects assigned to receive tofacitinib will take 1 tablet (dispensed in bottles) of tofacitinib citrate (5 mg) BID. These subjects will also take 4 MR tablets of placebo matching PF-06650833 MR tablets (dispensed in a blister pack) once daily (Table 5). In regions where tofacitinibs inclusion in this study as an active control is not accepted by local regulatory authorities and ethics committees, subjects will only be randomized to PF-06650833 or matching placebo (dispensed in blister packs) and will not receive bottles of tofacitinib or matching placebo (Table 6).

Since the use of tofacitinib in this study may be not be acceptable by regulatory authorities/ethics committess in all countries, achieving full randomization into the tofacitinib arm may prove logistically challenging. Since the tofacitinib arm is serving as an active control for the study, enrollment of approximately 20-30 subjects into that arm will be acceptable. Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 20 weeks. This includes an up to 28 day screening period, a 12 week treatment period, and a 4 week follow-up period. Subjects will remain on stable background arthritis therapy, which must include methotrexate (supplemented with folic/folinic acid per local treatment guidelines). Subjects additionally may continue stable doses of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, allowed opioids and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol for pain control; and/or low dose oral corticosteroids (10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Methotrexate must have been dosed orally or, at equivalent doses, parenterally (IM or SC, only; IV administration is not permitted) for at least 3 months (prior to baseline randomization) to establish inadequate response, the dose must have been stable for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study drug, and the dose must remain stable during the study. Allowed methotrexate doses are 15 to 25 mg, inclusive, weekly, unless there is documented (in the source documentation) intolerance to or toxicity from these doses, in which case a dose between 10 and <15 mg, inclusive, may be used.

" the first injection of c. difficile vaccine or placebo was given at day 1 (dose 1). the second injection was given at month 1 (dose 2) and the third injection was given at month 6 (dose 3). if a participant had diarrhea 3 or more times in a 24-hour period at any time during the study, the participant collected a stool sample for testing and an in-person visit was triggered. a blood sample was taken at this additional visit. in this study, researchers looked at the number of new c. difficile infections starting at 14 days after dose 2 and starting at 14 days after dose 3. a new infection meant the participant had no episodes of c. difficile infection in the past. a c. difficile infection was defined as either:  diarrhea 3 or more times in a 24-hour period plus a stool sample testing positive for c. difficile; or  inflammation of the bowel diagnosed by a doctor to be caused by c. difficile plus a stool sample testing positive for c. difficile where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 410 locations in 23 countries in 5 regions in the world (east-asia, europe, north america, oceania and south america). when did this study take place? it began 29 march 2017 and ended 21 december 2021. who participated in this study? the study included 17,535 men and women who were at least 50 years old and who were at risk of developing a c. difficile infection.  a total of 8467 men (49%) were given c. difficile vaccine or placebo  a total of 8973 women (51%) were given c. difficile vaccine or placebo  all participants were between the ages of 50 and 97 a total of 95% of participants received dose 2, and 90% of participants received dose 3. a total of 36% of participants left before the study was over. the most common reasons for leaving the study early were the participants choice (24% of participants), lost to follow-up (4% of participants), or the participant passed away for any reason (4% of participants). lost to follow-up means that the participant did not return for study visits and did not respond to phone calls from the study site staff. how long did the study last? study participants were in the vaccination phase of the study for up to 6 months. the entire study, from the time of consent to the last follow-up, took about 4 years and 8 months to complete. when the study ended in december 2021, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AlOH-containing C difficile vaccine (200 g total toxoid) administered as a 3-dose regimen at Months 0, 1, and 6 in adults 50 years of age and above. Subjects will be randomly assigned in parallel in a 1:1 ratio to receive C difficile vaccine (200 g total toxoid) or placebo (saline). This is an event-driven study with a total target of 66 first primary CDI cases (meeting case definition 1 in the per-protocol-3 population, Section 2.1.1 and Section 9.2.1) to be accrued for the study; the total enrollment number may vary depending on the incidence rate of the primary endpoint, true underlying VE, and potential early stop for efficacy or futility (see Section 9.2). 3.1. Approximate Number of Subjects It is anticipated that up to approximately 17,476 adults, 50 years of age and above, may be enrolled globally to accumulate 66 first primary CDI cases (meeting case definition 1, Section 2.1.1). As this is an event-driven and group-sequential (GS) study, the final enrollment number may vary depending on the incidence rate of the primary endpoint, true underlying VE, and potential early stop for efficacy or futility. The number of subjects enrolled in each country and at each site will vary based on enrollment capabilities. Update as Part of Amendment 2 (January 2019): Based on the ongoing blinded review of pooled primary CDI events, it is planned to enroll approximately 1700 additional subjects, giving a total of approximately 17,476 subjects (see Section 9.1). To achieve a broad representation of age groups among those 50 years and older, and achieve an adequate rate of CDI, the numbers of subjects intended to be enrolled in each of 4 age categories is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Intended Numbers of Subjects Included in the Study, by Age 50-59 years 800 subjects 1600 subjects Table 1. Intended Numbers of Subjects Included in the Study, by Age On monitoring the pooled primary CDI event rates in different age groups, inclusion criteria subgroups, Charlson Comorbidity Index61 (CCI) subgroups, and other baseline factors, once the specified minimum numbers in each age group have been achieved, if a substantially higher pooled CDI event rate is observed in some subgroups, the intention may be to stop enrollment in lower-risk subgroups and complete enrollment with the higher-risk subgroups thereafter. This is mainly to help to achieve the targeted total number of first primary cases in a timely manner. Subjects withdrawn from the study after randomization will not be replaced, regardless of the reason for withdrawal. 3.2. Approximate Duration of the Study As this study is event-driven, the study duration will be dependent on CDI event rate. The study may be terminated earlier for efficacy or futility as described in Section 9.5. Given that this is an event-driven study, the end of trial is defined as database lock as described in Section 13. 3.3. Approximate Duration of Subject Participation Subjects will be followed from the time they sign the ICD until sufficient cases have been accrued to declare efficacy or futility."
" how was the study done? researchers studied a group of participants to learn more about the safety and the possible effectiveness of talazoparib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and dna-repair defects. participants included in the study:  were examined by a study doctor and determined to be appropriate to participate  were adult men  had a recent biopsy of their prostate cancer  had confirmed prostate cancer with a dna-repair defect (mistake in dna)  were currently either receiving drugs or had their testes removed with the aim to reduce androgen in the body. this strategy is called adt (androgen deprivation therapy)  had prostate cancer that was metastatic and was progressive (getting worse)  had previously been treated with 1 or 2 different chemotherapy regimens first, a study doctor checked each potential participant to make sure they were appropriate to join the study. this is known as the screening period. most participants received 1 milligram (mg) talazoparib once a day (participants with moderate kidney disease received 0.75 mg talazoparib once a day), and could continue receiving talazoparib until their cancer worsened, they had unacceptable medical problems, they chose to stop taking talazoparib, they passed away, or they were no longer benefitting from talazoparib. participants also continued to take adt throughout the study. this was an open-label study, which means that the participants, researchers, and study doctors knew which treatment the participants received. participants were expected to attend visits at the study center every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks (through week 9), then every 4 weeks through week 25, and every 12 weeks thereafter. they had imaging tests done at some of these visits, to see if their prostate cancer was growing or shrinking. participants were also expected to attend an end-of-treatment visit about 4 weeks after their last dose of talazoparib, plus safety follow-up visits every 8 to 12 weeks until the study ended. the figure below shows what happened during the study. where did this study take place? participants were recruited from 43 hospitals, cancer centers, and medical centers in australia, austria, belgium, brazil, france, germany, hungary, italy, the netherlands, poland, spain, south korea, the united kingdom, and the united states. when did this study take place? it began 04 july 2017 and is scheduled to end 02 september 2022. the sponsor reviewed the information collected and created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. who participated in this study? a total of 128 men joined this study, and 127 men received study treatment. all participants were between the ages of 46 and 84 years. of the 127 participants who received study treatment, 97 (76%) completed treatment. at the time the sponsor reviewed the information collected, 30 participants were still receiving study treatment. "," Overall Study Design and Plan: Description This is an international, phase 2, open-label, soft tissue response rate study of talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor in development for the treatment of cancer. At least 100 men with measurable soft tissue disease (per RECIST1.1) and progressive metastatic CRPC and DNA damage repair deficiencies likely to sensitize to PARP inhibition will be enrolled. Eligible patients must have previously received 1 to 2 chemotherapy regimens including at least 1 taxane-based regimen for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, and progressed on at least 1 line of novel hormonal therapy (enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate/prednisone) for treatment of metastatic CRPC. Biopsies of the brain, lung/mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic procedures extending beyond the esophagus, stomach, or bowel may not be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility. Responses must be confirmed by a follow-up radiographic assessment at least 4 weeks later with a repeated computed tomography (CT)/MRI and with no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression on repeat bone scan at least 6 weeks later per PCWG3 criteria by independent central review. In addition, talazoparib can continue to be administered upon disease progression only if, in the opinion of the investigator the patient is clinically benefitting, no new concurrent systemic therapy is started, and the sponsor is notified. Safety follow-up after permanent discontinuation of study drug treatment will occur approximately 28 days after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of a new antineoplastic or investigational therapy, whichever occurs first. Long-term follow-up will occur every 8 (if study treatment discontinuation is prior to week 25) to 12 weeks (if study treatment discontinuation is at or beyond week 25) after safety follow-up. These assessments will be performed:  At baseline (Day 1);  Every 2 weeks (prior to Study Week 9) , weeks 9, 13, 17, 21 through Week 25, or radiographic progression, whichever is earlier;  Every 12 weeks after Week 25 until radiographic progression when no such progression had been previously documented;  During unscheduled visit(s) when no radiographic progression had been previously documented;  During safety follow up;  And at end of trial when study results are determined. Duration of Study The primary endpoint analysis will be performed when the last enrolled patient who does not discontinue treatment prematurely, completes at least 6 months of study drug treatment, withdraws consent, discontinues from the study, or dies, whichever occurs first. Discussion of Study Design and Rationale for Dose Selection Treatment of men with metastatic CRPC previously treated with taxane-based chemotherapy and who progressed on novel hormonal therapy is an area of high unmet need. Study C3441006 (MDV3800-06) is based on nonclinical studies supporting the sensitivity of prostate tumors with DNA damage repair deficiencies, which may sensitize to PARP inhibition, and clinical evidence demonstrating a high response rate to the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, in a in Section 1.2). Talazoparib has cytotoxic effects believed to be caused by inhibition of the catalytic activity of PARP-dependent DNA repair and suppression of DNA synthesis and transcription at sites of PARP trapping. Mechanisms of resistance to PARP inhibition may be shared with DNA-damaging agents such as cyclophosphamide and or mitoxantrone; thus, these agents and prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor in an experimental setting are excluded to maximize the likelihood of treatment efficacy. Similarly, treatment with platinum-based therapies in the 6 months prior to screening, or progression on prior platinum-based therapy at any time in the past, will exclude participation. Treatment with chemotherapy (eg, docetaxel, cabazitaxel) within 28 days of Day 1 and on study is also prohibited given the heightened risk of myelosuppression. A known diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia and central laboratory hematology values below specified thresholds for hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count, and platelet count at screening are also exclusionary given the predicted risk of dose-dependent myelosuppression. Current or anticipated use within 7 days prior to first dose of study drug or anticipated use during the study of strong P-gp inhibitors is exclusionary. C3441006 (MDV3800-06) will include an efficacy assessment schedule of every 8 weeks during the first 24 weeks based on the standard of care for the target patient population with progressive advanced disease. Additional safety precautions will include monitoring for potential hematologic toxicities by evaluating complete blood counts every 2 weeks through week 9, every 4 weeks through week 25, and then every 8 weeks thereafter during treatment. Finally, patients with moderate renal impairment will receive talazoparib at a lower starting dose as they are at risk of higher exposure due to decreased renal clearance. Talazoparib 1 mg/day was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 monotherapy dose based on the results of the phase 1, dose-escalation study in patients with solid tumors, PRP-001. Based on population PK analyses, talazoparib CL/F was estimated to be 37.1% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment than in those with normal renal function, resulting in higher exposure (Section 1.3.3). Simulations were performed to predict the steady-state exposure (AUC) for a 0.75 mg/day dose in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) and for a 1 mg/day dose in patients with normal renal function (eGFR  90 mL/min/1.73 m2) (Table 7). The predicted exposure at 0.75 mg/day for patients with moderate renal impairment is comparable to the exposure at 1 mg/day for patients with normal renal function as assessed by steady-state AUC. Patient with moderate renal impairment should remain on a reduced talazoparib dose throughout the study; dose escalation to a dose of 1 mg/day is not permitted for those patients."
" this study included patients who were treated with both crisaborole and plain ointment on 2 different areas of the skin. the areas of skin were then compared to see if atopic dermatitis symptoms would improve in the areas that were treated with crisaborole. the study included adult patients with atopic dermatitis. to join the study, patients must have had at least 2 areas of atopic dermatitis that were 3 centimeters x 3 centimeters or larger, and at least 5 centimeters apart. symptoms must have started at least 6 months before the study began, and must have been stable for at least 1 month. patients were screened by the study doctor to make sure they were able to join the study. this was known as the screening period, which lasted up to 30 days. patients then entered the double-blind treatment period, which lasted 15 days. double-blind means that patients and doctors did not know which area of skin was treated with which medicine. this was done to make sure that the trial results were not influenced in any way. for each patient, 1 area of skin was treated with crisaborole, and 1 area of skin was treated with plain ointment. patients came to the study center twice per day during this part of the study, so that they could receive treatment and be checked by the study doctor. on day 15 of the study, samples of the treated skin were collected to be used for testing. patients then entered the open-label treatment period, which lasted another 28 days until day 43 of the study. during this part of the study, patients stopped using the plain ointment and could use crisaborole to treat all areas of the skin affected by atopic dermatitis (except the scalp). open-label means that patients and doctors knew which medicine was being used. patients received a follow-up phone call on day 71 to check for any medical problems. this was considered the end of the study. the figure below shows what happened during this study. while patients were only in the study for 71 days, the entire study lasted about 9 months from start to finish. the sponsor ran this study at 1 location in canada. it began 31 july 2017 and ended 4 may 2018. a total of 13 men (33%) and 27 women (68%) participated. all patients were between the ages of 18 and 57. patients were expected to complete a 15-day double-blind treatment period followed by a 28-day open-label treatment period. of the 40 patients who started the study, 38 (95%) completed the study. 2 patients (5%) did not finish the study because they had a medical problem that was not considered related to the study treatment. when the study ended in may 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN Overview This is a Phase 2a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study to characterize the mechanism of action, by evaluation of efficacy and changes in key skin biomarkers, of crisaborole ointment 2% in subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. After completing screening activities, including meeting eligibility criteria, approximately 40 subjects will be treated. In the double-blind treatment period, each subject will be randomly assigned to be treated with crisaborole ointment 2% for one target lesion. The other target lesion will receive vehicle. The double-blind treatment period will last from Baseline/Day 1 to Day 15 skin biopsy collection and will include twice daily visits to the site for IP application and study assessments, where applicable. The open-label treatment period will start from the Day 15 skin biopsy collection and last until Day 43 (end of treatment/early termination); during this time, subjects will be able to treat all AD skin areas (except scalp), at home, with crisaborole ointment 2%. Scheduled (outpatient) study visits for all subjects will occur at Screening (up to 30 days prior to Day 1/Baseline), Days 1 to 14 (twice daily), Day 15, and Day 43 (end of treatment/early termination). On Day 71 (end of study), a follow-up telephone call will be made by site staff to assess for AEs that may have occurred since the last visit. For all subjects, one 4.5 mm skin biopsy will be collected from each target treatment area on Day 1, and Day 15. In addition, on Day 8, subjects will be offered one optional 4.5 mm skin biopsy collected from each target treatment area, to provide additional samples for analysis. The biopsies on Day 8 and Day 15 will be collected in the vicinity, but at least 1 cm distant from where the biopsies were collected at Day 1, even if the target treatment area has cleared. One additional 4.5 mm biopsy will be collected from nonlesional skin on Day 1. Each biopsy will be cut in half. One half will be used to perform reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR and gene arrays and the other half will be used for immunohistochemistry analysis and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Parameters studied using IHC will include epidermal thickness (performed on H&E sections), Ki-67+ cells, Keratin 16 (K16), CD3+ T-cells, CD11C+ dendritic cells (DCs), Fc Epsilon+ dendritic cells (DCs), langerin+ cells (for langerhans cells), filaggrin. Gene expression by RT PCR panel (skin ribonucleic acid [RNA]) will include levels of the following established cytokines associated with AD: IL-13, IL-19, IL-22, IL-17A, IL-23 (p19), IL-12/23 p40. Gene expression by TLDA RT PCR will include the levels of the following established cytokines associated with AD: IL- 1B , IL-2, IL-2RA, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p35, IL-12/23p40, IL-13, IL-15, IL-15RA, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-19, IL-22, IL-23 (p19), IL-31, IL-32, K16, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4D, filaggrin, loricrin, periplakin, S100A7, S100A9, S100A12, MMP12, IFN-gamma, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL20, elafin/PI3, hBD2, CCL13,CCL17, CCL18, CCL22, CCL26, FOXP3 and TSLP receptor, of which the following are considered the key biomarkers associated with AD pathways: S100A12 (general inflammation); Keratin 16 (epidermal hyperplasia; proliferation marker (barrier function)); Elafin/PI3 (Th17);CCL17 (Th2); CCL18 (Th2); CCL22 (Th2);IL13(Th2). PDE4 expression will be quantified in the tissue by TLDA. Gene arrays using Affymetrix UPlus 2 arrays will also be performed to allow for more global analyses of genomic changes and normalization of lesional samples towards non-lesional samples with treatment. Efficacy outcomes: Severity of AD will be characterized at baseline and throughout the study with the lesion ISGA, lesion TSS, percent of BSA with AD (%BSA), ISGA, CCI and pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS). Lesion ISGA and lesion TSS will be used to evaluate any correlation between change from baseline in biomarkers and AD severity. Safety Outcomes: Safety will be assessed by physical exams, standard laboratory testing and collection of AEs. the study."
" this study compared 5 groups of participants to find out if participants taking pf-05221304 had a reduced amount of fat in the liver compared to participants taking a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine. the study included participants who had a high amount of fat in their liver that was not related to alcohol consumption, and who were overweight. the participants and researchers did not know who took pf-05221304 and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. participants were put into 1 of 5 groups by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups more similar. reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare. this study was also double-blinded. this means that participants and doctors did not know who was given which treatment/medicine. this was done to make sure that the trial results were not influenced in any way. while participants were only in the study for 16 weeks, or approximately 4 months, the entire study took 19 months, or just over a year and a half to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 76 locations in 6 countries in europe, the middle east, north america, and asia-pacific. it began on 22 august 2017 and ended on 27 march 2019. a total of 134 men and 171 women participated. all participants were between the ages of 19 and 70 years. participants were to be treated for 16 weeks or approximately 4 months. of the 1705 volunteers who were assessed, 643 entered the main study, 305 participants were randomized and started treatment, and 263 finished the study. there were 42 participants who started treatment but did not finish the study. these participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for the participant to stop being in the study. when the study ended in march 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Study Overview This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-arm (placebo, plus 4 active doses of PF-05221304), parallel-group study. Determination of eligibility for this study will occur via a sequential, 3-step process  starting with pre-qualification. Subjects identified to be eligible based on pre-qualification will then undergo Visit 1 (Screen 1) with only those confirmed to continue to be eligible progressing to Visit 2 (Screen 2). For a given subject, this 3-step eligibility assessment (from pre-qualification to Screen 2, inclusive) may take up to 2-months. Once confirmed to be eligible based on Screen 2 procedure(s), subjects will progress to a run-in phase when concomitant treatment(s) will be stabilized, and baseline-related visits will occur. At Visit 5 (Day 1), subjects will be randomized to receive 1 of 5 blinded regimens for a duration of up to 16 weeks (ie, 1084 days). Excluding the pre-qualification visit, this study includes a total of 12 scheduled outpatient visits in the morning, CCI and a potential for up to at least 3 visits for repeat assessments (for procedures/tests at Visit 1, Visit 2, or 2nd Follow-up visit). The total participation, from Visit 1 (Screen 1) to 2nd Follow-up visit, will be 27-weeks (minimum) to 35-weeks (maximum)  refer to Figure 2. C1171002 Study Design At least 360 subjects (72 per arm) will be randomized at approximately 120 sites to ensure a minimum of 300 subjects (60 per arm) complete the study. In each arm,  50% of subjects randomized will be deemed to be eligible for 1st tier stratification of diagnosed/presumed NASH; with the remaining subjects per arm eligible for 1st tier stratification of NAFLD with likely minimal inflammation and fibrosis  refer to Section 4.3. Subjects who are noted to have non-evaluable baseline MRI-PDFF, as determined by the sponsor-identified central imaging vendor, may be replaced, at sponsor discretion  refer to Section 7.1.4; otherwise, there are no plans to replace subjects who are prematurely withdrawn. To ensure that the required minimum number of subjects complete the study, the plan is to overenroll by approximate 20% to account for premature early withdrawal. Stopping Rules for Dosing in Individual Subjects At investigator discretion, for subjects safety, dosing with double-blinded investigational product (ie, post randomization), may be stopped in an individual subject  either temporarily or permanently. In such cases, any open TEAEs must be followed to resolution or until such time that the event is viewed to have stabilized  refer to Section 8 for details  specifically, Section 8.1 which outlines the requirements for reporting adverse events, Section 8.2.3 detailing definition of serious adverse events, and Section 8.4.2 summarizing management of potential cases of drug-induced liver injury which are categorized as An example where temporary discontinuation of dosing with investigational product, may be considered appropriate includes hospitalization with subsequent discharge within  7-days in stable medical condition, as determined by medically-qualified investigator. Of note, in this study, re-challenge/re-initiation of dosing with double-blinded investigational product should not be attempted in subjects who meet threshold for withdrawal based on platelet count (Appendix 2) or fasting serum triglycerides (Appendix 3). Examples where permanent discontinuation of dosing and withdrawal of the subject from the study is deemed appropriate, as determined by investigators medical judgment, include:  Hospitalization due to serious adverse event (SAE) resulting in clinical decompensation of the subject and necessitating continued inpatient stay for more than 7-days;  Subjects observed to have a decline over time ultimately reaching the threshold of < 75,000/mm3 in platelet count  refer to Section 7.9.1 and Appendix 2 for additional guidance;  Individual subjects with consistently increasing fasting serum triglycerides over time ultimately reaching the threshold of  800 mg/dL (9 mmol/L)  refer to Section 7.9.2 and Appendix 3 for additional guidance;  Of note, in both the above cases of pre-identified laboratory thresholds, 1 additional unplanned assessment may be warranted before permanent withdrawal if the threshold is observed to be met as an isolated occurrence relative to all prior results and subject is asymptomatic. Considerations for Pausing or Stopping Active Dose(s) Based on Observed Safety The decision to pause or stop dosing at a study-level, for 1 or more active dose(s) of PF-05221304 may be considered based on recommendation from the Internal Review Committee (IRC) according to their review of unblinded, study-level emerging, observed safety data  refer to Section 9.5. In addition, during study conduct, after approximately every 20% of the total planned randomizations [for example: 72 subjects (20%), 145 subjects (40%), 215 subjects (60%), and 290 subjects (81%) of planned 360 subjects], based on blinded safety review by the selected members of the Sponsors study team, unblinded review of the safety data by the IRC will be triggered and a determination of the safety to continue the study documented if post randomization either of the below conditions are met   More than 20% of subjects, develop a moderate or severe AE in the same system organ class (SOC);  More than 15 % of subjects meet the individual permanent discontinuation of dosing rules (Section 3.2)."
" how was the study done? researchers tested pf-06687234 in a group of study participants to find out if study participants taking this treatment could achieve remission of their uc when also given infliximab. infliximab is a licensed treatment for uc. researchers then compared the results of study participants taking the study medication to the results of study participants taking placebo and infliximab. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medication. the study participants and researchers did not know who took pf-06687234 and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. the figure on the next page shows what happened during this study. sc = subcutaneous. note: all participants were to remain in the study for 22 weeks even if they stopped the study treatment before they had completed 12 weeks of treatment so that they could be monitored for safety. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 27 locations in 11 countries in the united states, europe, the middle east, asia, and australia. when did this study take place? it began 20 december 2017 and ended 07 january 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who had active uc and who had partially responded to treatment with infliximab, but who had not achieved remission. participants did not have other bowel diseases, such as crohns disease, infectious colitis, or colon cancer.  a total of 13 men participated  a total of 7 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 20 and 73 years. participants were to be treated for 12 weeks with pf-06687234 and infliximab and a further 10 weeks when pf-06687234 was to be stopped but infliximab was continued. of the 20 participants who started the study, 19 participants finished the study and completed the safety follow-up. there were 15 participants who finished the 12 weeks of treatment (7 in the pf-06687234 group and 8 in the placebo group) and 5 participants did not finish treatment. the participants who did not finish treatment included:  3 participants in the pf-06687234 group 1 participant because of medical problems o 1 participant because of lack of treatment effect o 1 participant by their own choice o  2 participants in the placebo group both because of medical problems. o how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for 22 weeks. the entire study ran for just over 3 years. this study was stopped because pf-06687234 was not working as well as the researchers hoped. when the study ended in january 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Study Overview This is a Phase 2A, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study in subjects with active UC and a non-remission (partial) response to anti-TNF- therapy. Each subject will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms (1 active; 1 placebo) with approximately 76 subjects in total (38 subjects per arm) enrolled for the study to achieve a total of 64 evaluable subjects. Using the Mayo scoring definitions in Appendix 2 and Appendix 3, clinical remission in this protocol is defined as those subjects with a traditional endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 and rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Eligible subjects for enrollment will meet criteria for partial response to infliximab but in non-remission during screening, despite at least 14 weeks after initiation of infliximab therapy for active UC prior to study entry. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will be eligible for this study provided these women use two methods of contraception, as outlined in Section 4.4.1. Figure 3. Study Design Schematic 3.1.1. Additional Pharmacokinetic Sampling For most subjects participating in Study B7581002 a sparse PK sampling scheme will be followed. As the PK of PF-06687234 in UC subjects has not been characterized, to better understand the PK of PF-06687234, a more extensive PK sampling scheme may be used in a subgroup of approximately 12 subjects who provide consent from any investigational site. For specific details refer to Section 7.5.2 regarding the additional PK sampling. 3.2. Duration of Subject Participation The duration of participation for eligible subjects will be approximately 26 weeks. This will include a 4-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, a 10-week follow-up period which will include a telephone contact conducted 6-weeks after the onsite follow-up visit. During the treatment period subjects will visit the clinic every week (2 days) for SC administration of 20 mg of the investigator product (IP) or placebo for a total of 12 visits. In addition, all subjects enrolled in the study will be continuing treatment with their infliximab therapy as a background therapy during the study. Subjects will be administered their infliximab at the baseline visit on study Day 1 and subsequent doses given at appropriate study visits based on subjects background dosing interval for infliximab. Subjects will be required to return to the clinic for one visit 4 weeks after the last visit during the treatment period to evaluate for safety which will constitute an onsite follow-up visit. Subjects on infliximab every 8 weeks will also be administered their infliximab therapy at this visit. Subjects on infliximab every 6 weeks will require an additional site visit for administration of their infliximab at Week 18. There will be a telephone contact conducted at Week 22 to confirm any SAEs have been reported to the Sponsor and to provide results of Subjects with no detectable HAFA or NAb against IL-10 portion of PF-06687234 by the Week 16 visit will not require further follow-up beyond the Week 22 telephone contact. However, subjects with detectable HAFA or NAb against the IL-10 portion of PF-06687234 at Week 16 will be informed of their immunogenicity status at the Week 22 telephone contact. These subjects will be required to return for an onsite visit at Week 28 for repeat immunogenicity testing. If these subjects have detectable HAFA or NAb against the IL-10 portion of PF-06687234 from the immunogenicity sample collection at Week 28, they will require one additional follow-up collection 3 months after Week 28 at approximately Week 40. For early withdrawal subjects with detectable NAb against IL-10 of PF-06687432 and HAFA during the treatment period, their immunogenicity tests will be repeated at the Follow-up visit, and approximately every three months for a maximum of 6 months from the follow-up visit until the level of NAb against the IL-10 portion of PF-06687432 and HAFA return to baseline level, or for 6 months, or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator and sponsor. At the discretion of the sponsor, the subjects with positive NAb against IL-10 may be tested for immunogenicity at shorter intervals (<3 months) or followed for longer than a 6 month duration. 3.3. Approximate Duration of Study Study enrollment is estimated to be completed in approximately 19 months. The completion of the study is estimated to occur in approximately 26 months."
" how was the study done? this study was an open-label study, which means that participants and doctors knew what medicines were given to participants. this study was done in 2 parts. part 1 the purpose of part 1 was to find the recommended dose of binimetinib to study in part 2. during part 1, participants were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, group 1a and group 1b. group 1a participants received the following treatments:  binimetinib 45 milligrams (mg) twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks; if this dose level of binimetinib had dlts, the following lower dose levels of binimetinib were tested in order as follows: o 45 mg twice daily for 3 weeks then 1 week off o 30 mg twice daily for 4 weeks o 30 mg twice daily for 3 weeks then 1 week off  nivolumab 480 mg iv over 30 minutes every 4 weeks researchers used the results from group 1a to determine the recommended dose to test in group 1b. after group 1a completed study treatment, other participants started group 1b. group 1b participants received the following treatments:  binimetinib 45 milligram (mg) twice daily by mouth for 4 weeks; if this dose level of binimetinib had dlts, the following lower dose levels of binimetinib were tested in order as follows: o 45 mg twice daily for 3 weeks then 1 week off o 30 mg twice daily for 4 weeks o 30 mg twice daily for 3 weeks then 1 week off  nivolumab 480 mg iv over 30 minutes every 4 weeks  ipilimumab 1 mg per kilogram (kg) (1 mg/kg) iv over 30 minutes about every 8 weeks participants received study treatments in cycles that lasted 28 days. participants were to attend visits at the study center on days 1, 15, and 22 of the first cycle, and on days 1 and 15 of the following cycles. they were also asked to attend an end of treatment visit within 2 weeks of stopping study treatment, and attend follow-up visits 30 days and 100 days after stopping treatment. they were then contacted by phone 150 days after stopping study treatment, and every 12 weeks until the study ended. the figure below shows what happened during part 1. part 2 during part 2 of the study, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, group 2a and group 2b. randomly means that participants were assigned to the treatment groups by chance, like a flip of a coin. participants had an equal chance of being in group 2a or group 2b. group 2a participants received the following treatments:  binimetinib at the recommended dose from part 1, given twice a day by mouth for 4 weeks  nivolumab 480 mg iv over 30 minutes every 4 weeks group 2b participants received the following treatments:  binimetinib at the recommended dose from part 1, twice a day by mouth for 4 weeks  nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks iv over 30 minutes on day 1 of each treatment cycle  ipilimumab 1 mg/kg iv over 30 minutes about every 8 weeks participants received study treatments in cycles that lasted 28 days. participants were to attend visits at the study center on days 1, 15, and 22 of the first cycle, and on days 1 and 15 of the following cycles. they were also asked to attend an end of treatment visit within 2 weeks of stopping study treatment, and attend follow-up visits 30 days and 100 days after stopping treatment. they were then contacted by phone 150 days after stopping study treatment, and every 12 weeks until the study ended. the figure below shows what happened during part 2. where did this study take place?

", 4.0 STUDY DESIGN
" this study compared 2 groups of participants to find out if participants given the 20vpnc vaccine followed by placebo reacted differently compared to participants given the comparator vaccine of 13vpnc followed by ppsv23. a placebo does not have any vaccine in it, but it looks just like the study vaccine. a comparator is usually a licensed drug or vaccine this is similar to the one being tested in the clinical study. the study included adult participants, aged between 60 and 64 years, who had not previously been vaccinated with a pneumococcal vaccine (13vpnc or ppsv23). this trial was double-blinded. this means that participants and doctors did not know which participant received 20vpnc and placebo vaccines or the comparator vaccine 13vpnc and ppsv23. this was done to make sure that the clinical study results were not influenced in any way. participants were put into 1 of the 2 vaccine groups by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups more similar. reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare. while participants were only in the study for 12 months, the entire study took around 14 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 14 locations in the united states. it began on 10 october 2017 and ended on 10 december 2018. there were 195 men and 248 women who participated. all participants were between the ages of 60 and 64 years. participants were given 1 injection of vaccine (20vpnc or 13vpnc) at the start of the study (vaccination 1) and a second injection of vaccine (placebo or ppsv23) approximately 1 month later (vaccination 2). the participants had their health checked and blood samples were collected before vaccination 1 and before vaccination 2. the participants then returned to the study center for further assessments and for blood samples to be collected 1 month after vaccination 2. participants then had their health checked by telephone 6 months after vaccination 1. the participants returned to the study center for the final assessments and for blood samples to be collected 12 months after vaccination 1. when the participants visited the study center for vaccination 1, they were given an electronic diary (e-diary). they were asked to record information about redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 10 days after vaccination 1 in the e-diary. the participants were also to use the e-diary to record information about fever, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, and/or pain in the joints as well as any medicines taken to treat pain or fever within 7 days after vaccination 1. a of the 221 participants given 20vpnc, 220 completed the e-diary after vaccination 1. of the 444 participants who started the study, there were 443 participants who received the first vaccine and 1 participant who did not receive vaccination 1. there were 427 participants who then went on to receive the second vaccine and 16 participants who did not receive vaccination 2 (8 in the placebo group and 8 in the ppsv23 group). there were 404 participants who finished this 12-month study. there were 40 participants who did not finish the study and these participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. when the study ended in december 2018, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN This will be a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind study with a 2-arm parallel design, conducted at investigative sites in the United States. A total of 440 adults 60 through 64 years of age with no history of pneumococcal vaccination will be enrolled and randomized equally to receive an initial vaccination with either: o a single dose of 20vPnC followed 1 month later by saline (placebo) administration in the active vaccine group (20vPnC/saline group), or o a single dose of 13vPnC followed 1 month later by a dose of PPSV23 in the control group (13vPnC/PPSV23 group). 13vPnC will serve as a control for safety, as well as immunogenicity of the 13 serotypes in common with 20vPnC. PPSV23 will serve as a control for immunogenicity of the 7 additional serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F) in 20vPnC as described in Table 1. Table 1.

SAEs and newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs) will be collected through Visit 5 (12 months after Visit 1). On Day 1 (Visit 1), subjects will have blood drawn for immunogenicity assessments, receive an investigational product (20vPnC or 13vPnC; the investigational products have the same appearance and can be administered by unblinded or blinded site staff), be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and receive safety follow-up and electronic diary (e-diary) instructions. Local reactions (pain, redness, and swelling) at the injection site will be prompted for and collected daily in an e-diary from Day 1 through Day 10 after the Visit 1 vaccination. Systemic events (fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain) and use of antipyretic medications will be prompted for and collected daily in an e-diary from Day 1 through Day 7 after the Visit 1 vaccination. AEs (including nonserious AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs) will be assessed for approximately 1 month after the Visit 1 vaccination (through Visit 2). Refer to Section 8.1.4 for the definition of an NDCMC. At Visit 2 (28-35 days after Visit 1), subjects will return for follow-up. Information will be collected from the subjects on AEs and e-diary follow-up (as needed), blood will be drawn for immunogenicity assessments (this represents the 1-month postVaccination 1 time point), a dose of saline will be administered to subjects who received 20vPnC at Visit 1, and PPSV23 will be administered to subjects who received 13vPnC at Visit 1. The subjects will be observed for 30 minutes and will receive safety follow-up instructions. The investigational product will be prepared at this visit by a designated unblinded site staff member. AEs (including nonserious AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs) will be assessed for approximately 1 month after the Visit 2 vaccination (through Visit 3). At Visit 3 (28-35 days after Visit 2), subjects will return for safety follow-up and a blood draw for immunogenicity assessments. At Visit 4 (approximately 6 months after the first vaccination), the sites will contact the subject via telephone to inquire about SAEs and NDCMCs. At Visit 5 (12 months [350 to 378 days] after the first vaccination), subjects will return to have a blood draw for immunogenicity assessments. SAEs and NDCMCs will also be collected at this visit. CCI CCI 3.1. Duration of Subject Participation Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 12 months. 3.2. Duration of Study The study duration will be approximately 16 months. Number of Subjects Approximately 440 subjects (220 per group) will be randomized for a total of approximately 400 evaluable subjects (assuming a 10% dropout rate). Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study after randomization will not be replaced, regardless of the reason for withdrawal."
" this study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if more patients taking pf-04965842 had their ad improve compared to patients taking a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine. the study included adult men and women, and boys and girls who were aged 12 years and older. patients included in the study:  had chronic (long-term) ad for at least 1 year, and had moderate to severe ad when they entered the study.  also had one of the following: o had been treated up to 6 months earlier for ad with medicines applied to the skin, and their ad did not get better; o were unable to use medicines on the skin because of a medical problem; o needed to use medicines that reach all parts of the body to control their ad (for example, taking medicines by mouth). the patients and doctors did not know who took pf-04965842 and who took the placebo. this is known as a double-blinded study. this is done to make sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone. patients were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) to receive either pf-04965842 at a dose of 100 mg, pf-04965842 at a dose of 200 mgor placebo. patients had an 80% (4 out of 5) chance of receiving pf-04965842 and a 20% (1 out of 5) chance of receiving placebo. this is known as a randomized study. this study used 2 different tests to measure the severity of the patients ad at the beginning of the study and throughout 12 weeks of treatment. the first test is called the investigators global assessment (iga) scale and measures the severity of ad on a 5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst). the second test is called the eczema area and severity index, and measures how severe a patients ad is based on 4 different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by ad. the difference in each patients score between the start of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment was used to decide if their ad had improved. while patients were only in the study for 12 to 16 weeks, the entire study took 15 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 69 locations in 8 countries in north america, europe, and australia. it began 07 december 2017 and ended 26 march 2019. a total of 167 women or girls and 220 men or boys participated. all patients were between the ages of 12 and 84. patients were to be treated until the end of the 12 week treatment period. of the 387 patients who started the study, 333 finished the study. 25 patients did not finish the study because of medical problems. 13 patients left before the study was over by their choice or their parents choice, or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. when the study ended in march 2019 as planned, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PF-04965842 monotherapy in subjects aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe AD and a body weight 40 kg. The treatment duration is 12 weeks. Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product to confirm that they meet the subject selection criteria for the study. A total of approximately 375 subjects will be enrolled from approximately 75 sites located globally. Adolescent subjects below the age of 18 years old (or country-specific age of majority) will only be enrolled in this study if instructed by the sponsor and approved by the country or regulatory/health authority. If these approvals have not been granted, only subjects aged 18 years (or country-specific age of majority) and older will be enrolled. A study design schematic is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Study Design Schematic Qualified subjects completing the 12-week treatment period of the study will have the option to enter a long-term extension (LTE) study B7451015. Subjects discontinuing early from treatment, or who are otherwise ineligible for the LTE study will undergo a 4 week follow-up period in B7451012. Subjects who have chronic moderate to severe AD as defined per the inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive 200 mg or 100 mg PF-04965842 once daily (QD), or matching placebo. Investigators, subjects, and the sponsor study team will be blinded as to treatment group. After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. For subjects younger than 18 years old (or country-specific age of majority), their parent(s)/legal guardian will provide supplementary or sole written consent and minor children will provide assent, according to local regulations and rules regarding ability to give assent and consent. Subjects will undergo screening within 28 days prior to randomization. During the screening period, treatments for AD will be washed out, as applicable, according to eligibility requirements. Subjects may be re-screened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions, unless the reason for the screen failure the disease severity inclusion criteria. Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo Day 1/baseline assessments and be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive 200 mg PF-04965842 (N=150) or 100 mg PF-04965842 QD (N=150) or matching placebo (N=75) from Day 1. Randomization will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [IGA = 3] vs. severe [IGA = 4] AD), and, age <18 and 18. Eligible subjects must have a documented history of inadequate response or intolerance to treatment with topical AD medications or have required systemic therapies for control of their disease."
" this study evaluated two groups of participants given weekly injections of marstacimab at different doses. this was done to see if participants had any medical problems while taking marstacimab and to see if this treatment could prevent bleeding episodes. the study was open to male participants, between 18 and 75 years old, with a diagnosis of severe hemophilia type a or b, with or without inhibitors. twenty (20) participants enrolled in the study: 18 of these participants had participated in a previous marstacimab study (b7841002) and the other 2 participants, both without inhibitors, were taking marstacimab for the first time. this was an open-label study, so everyone, including the participants, knew what treatment was given to each group. while participants were only in the study for 1 year, the entire study took 26 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 11 locations in 9 countries in africa, europe, north america and south america. it began 30 may 2018 and ended 05 august 2020. twenty (20) men and no women participated. all participants were between the ages of 19 and 57 years old. participants were to be treated until the end of their 1 year study period. of the 20 participants who started the study, 18 finished the study. two (2) participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. when the study ended in august 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

" how was the study done? this study included participants with aml who had not previously been treated for their cancer. the participants were split into 2 groups:  an intensive treatment group  this included participants who were suitable for intensive chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin  a non-intensive treatment group  this included participants who were not suitable for intensive chemotherapy and who were given standard chemotherapy with azacitidine. the researchers then tested glasdegib on each group of study participants to find out if study participants taking glasdegib plus chemotherapy lived longer compared to study participants given placebo plus chemotherapy. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medication. participants took glasdegib or placebo tablets once a day and this treatment could be continued for up to 2 years. participants received intensive or non-intensive chemotherapy, and this was given according to the manufacturers recommendations. participants who stopped treatment in this study were followed to check on their health. researchers compared the results of study participants taking glasdegib plus chemotherapy to the results of study participants taking placebo plus chemotherapy. the study participants and researchers did not know who took glasdegib and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. this study was double- blinded, which means nobody knew who was taking what treatment during the study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. the study plan is shown in figure 1. figure 1: study plan where did this study take place? for the intensive treatment group, the sponsor ran this study at 94 locations in 20 countries in north america, central america, europe, asia, and australia. for the non-intensive treatment group, the sponsor ran this study at 83 locations in 21 countries in north america, central america, europe, asia, and australia. when did this study take place? for the intensive treatment group, the study began 20 april 2018 and ended 01 february 2021, with data collected up to 11 november 2021. for the non-intensive treatment group, the study began 18 june 2018 and ended 05 june 2020, with data collected up to 17 january 2022. who participated in this study? the study included participants who had aml but who had not previously been treated for their cancer. in the intensive treatment group,  a total of 236 men participated  a total of 168 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 19 and 86 years in the non-intensive treatment group,  a total of 186 men participated  a total of 139 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 47 and 94 years participants were to be treated until their cancer got worse, they experienced unacceptable toxicity, they left the study, or the participant died. in the intensive treatment group, of the 399 participants who started the study and received treatment, 390 participants stopped taking the study treatment. all 399 participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study, or because they passed away, or the sponsor closed the study. most participants left the study because they died. in the non-intensive treatment group, of the 322 participants who started the study and received treatment, 306 participants stopped taking the study treatment. there were 305 participants who left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study, or because they passed away, or the sponsor closed the study. most participants left the study because they died or because the sponsor closed the study. there are 7 participants who are continuing in this study from the non-intensive treatment group. how long did the study last? in the intensive treatment group, study participants were in the study for up to 2 years and 9 months, with data collected for around 3 years and 7 months. in the non-intensive treatment group, study participants were in the study for up to 1 year and 11 months, with data collected for around 3 years and 7 months. the researchers stopped participants in the intensive treatment group from continuing in the study after an early analysis of the data in 2020. they did this because they found there was no difference between the participants who were treated with glasdegib plus intensive chemotherapy and participants who were treated with placebo plus intensive chemotherapy. for the intensive treatment group, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected up to november 2021 and closed this part of the study early. the sponsor then created a report of the results. for the non-intensive treatment group, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected up to january 2022. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of the reports for the intensive treatment group and the non-intensive treatment group. at the time of writing, there are 7 participants from the non-intensive treatment group who are continuing in this study. "," STUDY DESIGN Two separate registration trials conducted under one protocol number are proposed to adequately and independently evaluate the addition of glasdegib in intensive and non-intensive chemotherapy populations. Study B1371019 (Figure 1) is a randomized (1:1), double-blind, multi-center, placebo controlled study of chemotherapy in combination with glasdegib versus chemotherapy in combination with placebo in adult patients with previously untreated AML (excluding APL with PML-RARA, AML with BCR-ABL1 and active central nervous system [CNS] leukemia) to support the proposed indication statements:  Intensive Study: Glasdegib is being studied in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin for the treatment of adult patients with untreated AML.  Non-intensive Study: Glasdegib is being studied in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of adult patients with untreated AML who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy. Schematic of Study Design * Section 5.5 describes dosing details for the intensive chemotherapy regimen(s) [including 7+3 or 5+2 option for Induction 2], non-intensive chemotherapy regimen, and experimental study drugs. Assignment to the Intensive Study or the Non-Intensive Study will be made by the Investigator based on the 2017 ELN recommendations.16 The treatment arm allocation for Arm A or Arm B within each study will be operated by the sponsor following the rules defined in Section 5.1. In each study, the primary endpoint will be OS, and the secondary endpoints would include response, duration of response, time to response, EFS, safety, CCI , PROs, and PK. Study visits would occur on the first day of each cycle during the treatment period, and after end of treatment per the Schedule of Events (Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3, Table 4) to evaluate safety, disease progression, further anti-cancer therapy, or death. Following consolidation therapy, glasdegib or placebo will be administered daily for up to 2 years after randomization or until they have 2 consecutive CR MRD-negative central laboratory results, whichever comes first.  For HSCT consolidation, glasdegib or placebo will be interrupted at least 28 days before HSCT Day 0 (day of HSCT) and resumed 30-60 days post HSCT, once there is ANC engraftment (0.5 x 109/L for 3 consecutive days without growth factor support), no ongoing  Grade 2 graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and no ongoing SAEs that prevent resumption of glasdegib or placebo in the judgement of the investigator. If a second induction is needed, Investigators may choose either a 5 day cytarabine continuous infusion plus daunorubicin for 2 days (5+2) or a 7 day cytarabine continuous infusion plus daunorubicin for 3 days (7+3);  If <5% bone marrow blasts and per investigator judgement: consolidation cytarabine or post remission HSCT with either or both of the following:  Consolidation with single-agent cytarabine 3 g/m2 IV for adults <60 years and 1 g/m2 for adults 60 years over 3 hours twice daily (BID) on Days 1, 3, and 5, every 28 days for up to 4 cycles or alternative single-agent cytarabine consolidation schedules may be used per local prescribing information. A total of 267 death events would provide 90% power to detect an improvement in overall survival from 21 months to 31.5 months assuming a composite mOS for the population as follows: young AML (aged 60 years) with a mOS of 23.7 months and elderly AML (aged >60 years) with a mOS of 15 months17,18 and with an HR=0.67 using a 1-sided log-rank test at a significance level of 0.025 and a 3-look group-sequential design. Two interim analyses will be conducted: an early interim analysis of OS after 50% death events occur (no plan to stop for efficacy even if the efficacy boundary is crossed) and an efficacy and futility analysis of OS after 70% death events occur in the Intensive Chemotherapy population or upon completion of enrollment, whichever is later. Non-Intensive Chemotherapy Study: Subjects will be stratified at randomization by genetic risk (favorable vs intermediate vs rAecteoitvael otrfe 3a2tm0 esnutb ajesc ftoslwlohwos :are not candidates to receive Intensive Chemotherapy will  Experimental Therapy: Glasdegib 100 mg PO QD or matching placebo is to be administered by mouth daily beginning on Day 1 of chemotherapy and will continue if subjects demonstrate reasonable evidence of clinical benefit and do not meet the criteria for progression regardless of any delays/modifications in the chemotherapy treatment.  Azacitidine will be administered by subcutaneous injection (SC) or intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 7 days, in 28 day cycles for as long as they do not meet the criteria for disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or death, whichever comes first. Glasdegib or placebo will be interrupted at least 28 days before HSCT Day 0 (day of stem cell infusion), and resumed 30-60 days post HSCT after documentation of ANC engraftment (0.5 x 109/L for 3 consecutive days without growth factor support), no ongoing  Grade 2 GVHD, and no ongoing SAEs that prevent resumption of glasdegib/placebo in the judgement of the Investigator. A total of 220 death events would provide 90% power to detect an improvement in overall survival from 10.4 months9 to 16.2 months with an HR=0.64 using a 1-sided log-rank test at a significance level of 0.025 and a 2-look group-sequential design. One interim efficacy and futility analysis of OS would be planned after 60% death events occur in the non-intensive chemotherapy population or upon completion of enrollment of these subjects, whichever is later. The interim and final analyses of the intensive chemotherapy and non-intensive chemotherapy populations will be conducted separately and independent of each other."
" how was the study done? participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. participants received 1 milligram (mg) talazoparib once per day by mouth, for 24 weeks (participants with kidney disease received a lower dose, 0.75 mg talazoparib). within 6 weeks of finishing talazoparib treatment, participants had surgery and study doctors took tissue samples to evaluate and remove breast cancer. this was an open-label study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose they received. participants joined the study and received talazoparib for 24 weeks and were expected to attend a follow-up visit about 4 weeks later. within 6 weeks of completing talazoparib treatment, participants had surgery (if appropriate) followed by another follow-up visit 4 weeks later. participants were thereafter contacted by phone about every 12 weeks for the remainder of the study. the figure below shows what happened during this study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 18 locations in the united states. when did this study take place? it began on 27 august 2018 and ended 23 september 2020. who participated in this study? this study included adult participants who:  had her2 negative (her2 is a type of protein receptor that may be on the surface of cancer cells) or early invasive triple-negative breast cancer  had a brca 1 or brca 2 gene mutation  were appropriate to receive treatment prior to surgery  had breast cancer which had not spread to parts of the body that are far away from the breast  had a measurable tumor and lymph nodes which were less than 2 inches in size  had not received other cancer treatment within the past 3 years (with the exception of treatments for breast cancer of the milk ducts only)  had adequate kidney, liver, and bone marrow function  a total of 61 women participated  no men participated  all participants were between the ages of 26 and 75 years participants received talazoparib treatment for 24 weeks. of the 61 participants who started the study, 45 participants (74%) completed talazoparib treatment. a total of 16 participants (26%) stopped taking talazoparib early  by their choice,  because their breast cancer was worsening,  because they had a medical problem, or  because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop talazoparib how long did the study last? the amount of time that each participant was in this study varied. the entire study took about 2 years to complete. after the last participants surgical safety follow-up was completed, the study ended in september 2020, and the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

" this study compared 2 groups of patients to find out if patients who took tofacitinib 5 mg twice per day had an improvement in as symptoms and physical functioning, compared to patients who took placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine being tested. using a placebo helps researchers learn if the study drug works better than no treatment at all. this study included adult men and women who:  had as that was confirmed by x-ray  were not helped by or could not tolerate treatment with nsaids, or treatment with both nsaids and tnf inhibitors patients were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. patients who were a good fit were assigned by chance alone to receive either tofacitinib or placebo for 16 weeks. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups more similar. reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women) makes the groups more even to compare. this part of the trial was also double-blinded. this means that patients and doctors did not know who was given which treatment. this was done to make sure that the trial results were not influenced in any way. after 16 weeks of double-blinded treatment, all patients were switched to open-label treatment with tofacitinib for 32 weeks. open-label means that both the doctors and patients knew which treatment they received. finally, patients were expected to complete a 28-day follow-up period after they finish study treatment. the figure below shows what happened during the study. patients were expected to be in the study for about 56 weeks total. the sponsor ran this study at 95 locations in asia, australia, europe, and north america. it began on 7 june 2018 and ended on 20 august 2020. a total of 224 men (83%) and 45 women (17%) participated. all patients were between the ages of 20 and 70 years. of the 269 patients who started the study and received treatment, 252 (94%) completed it. a total of 17 patients (6%) left the study early by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study. when the study ended in august 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety study of tofacitinib in subjects with active AS. Approximately 480 AS subjects will be screened globally in order that approximately 240 eligible subjects (120 per arm) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to tofacitinib 5 mg BID or matching placebo BID for a total of 16 weeks of blinded treatment. During the 16-week treatment period subjects will visit the clinic every two weeks (3 days) until the Week 4 visit and then every 4 weeks (7 days) until the completion of Week 16. At the Week 16 visit all subjects will be assigned to open-label tofacitinib and will visit the clinic every two months (7 days) until Week 48. Subjects will then return to the clinic for a Follow-up visit approximately 28 days after the Week 48 visit. There will be a total of 2 planned analyses conducted when all applicable subjects have completed their Week 16 and Week 48 (including follow-up) visits, respectively. CCI have completed their Week 16 visit (see Section 9.2). The investigators, subjects and sponsor study team will remain blinded to the first 16 weeks of treatment assignment through the entire duration of the trial until database release. Randomization will be stratified by prior treatment history: (1) bDMARD-naive and (2) Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitor-inadequate responder (TNFi-IR) or bDMARD use (non-IR). Approximately 80% of the subjects will be bDMARD-nave and have an inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs (designed as Stratum bDMARD-nave), and the other approximately 20% of subjects who had an inadequate response to at least one but not more than 2 TNFi and have an inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs or bDMARD use (non-IR) [designed as Stratum TNFi-IR or bDMARD use (non-IR)]. Subjects who had prior bDMARD use (non-IR) will be eligible to participate in the study and will be included in the TNFi-IR or bDMARD use (non-IR) stratum. An inadequate response to NSAID or TNFi treatment is defined as having a treatment related adverse event or lack of response to NSAID or TNFi treatment that was administered in accordance with its labeling recommendations. The sponsor may limit enrollment of subjects with baseline hsCRP below 0.287 mg/dl to match their estimated prevalence in AS. See Figure 1. Figure 1. Study Design Schematic Primary endpoint: Proportion of subjects achieving ASAS20 at 16 Active weeks AS: stratify 80% Tofacitinib 5mg BID Tofacitinib 5mg BID bDMARD nave; 20% TNFi IR or bDMARD PBO BID Tofacitinib 5mg BID use (non-IR) Follow Screen weeks -up 0* 16 48 *Randomize 1:1; N=120 per arm Active disease is required for entry into this study and is defined as: Modified New York Criteria for Ankylosing Spondylitis (1984), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score of 4 and back pain score (BASDAI Question 2) of 4. If subjects have fulfilled entry criteria, they will be randomized to receive either tofacitinib 5 mg BID or placebo. Including the Screening visit, subjects will return to the clinic site at above noted intervals for a total of 12 visits. If the subject completes the Follow-up visit, the minimum duration of participation will be approximately 56 weeks (Screening: 30 days, 16 week double blind treatment period, 32 week open-label treatment period, Follow-up visit: 28 days 7 days) without inclusion of any alterations in the visit schedule according to the protocol. Selected assessments during the study will need to be completed by a qualified blinded assessor. This blinded assessor should be blinded to subjects baseline treatment assignment, all previously completed efficacy assessments (including patients global assessment) and all safety data (eg, laboratory results, adverse events) in order that the current assessments are completed in an objective manner throughout the study. Amendment 3 All subjects in the study will be evaluated for risk factors for VTE50. The study investigator or designee will need to review each subjects medical history and study records, including their concomitant medications, to determine whether he/she is at high risk for developing VTE. A subject may be at high risk for VTE if he/she:  has heart failure or prior myocardial infarction within past 3 months;  has inherited coagulation disorders;  has had VTE, either deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism;  is taking combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy;  has a malignancy (association is strongest with cancers other than non- melanoma skin cancers);  is undergoing major surgery or is immobilized. Additional risk factors for VTE, such as age, diabetes, obesity (BMI30 kg/m2), smoking status, hypertension, and first degree family history of VTE should also be taken into consideration by the investigator and the sponsor medical monitor when evaluating the benefit:risk for each individual subject whether to discontinue from open-label 5 mg BID dose of tofacitinib. See Risk Factor Check for VTE in Section 7.1.14 for tofacitinib dosing guidance when a risk factor is identified. If a subject has one or more of the risk factors for VTE listed above under Amendment 3 and is receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID, they may remain on tofacitinib 5 mg BID after careful investigator assessment of benefit: risk. For subjects who do not have any of the risk factors for VTE listed above under Amendment 3, he/she will remain on their open-label tofacitinib dose of 5 mg BID."
" this study compared 2 different groups of participants to find out if participants reacted differently to the rsvpref vaccine by itself, the rsvpref vaccine that included aluminum hydroxide, the rsvpref vaccine plus a flu (influenza) vaccine, or placebo. the aluminum hydroxide is an ingredient that is commonly included in vaccines to make the immune system react more strongly to the vaccine. a placebo does not have any active ingredients in it but is given in the same way as the study vaccine. some participants were given placebo instead of the vaccine to see what would happen if the new vaccine was not given. the 2 different groups of participants were called the sentinel cohort and the expanded cohort. a cohort is just another word for a group of people in a clinical study. participants in the sentinel cohort were given rsvpref vaccine, rsvpref vaccine plus aluminum hydroxide, or placebo at visit 1. participants were initially given a low dose (60 g) of the rsvpref vaccine (with or without aluminum hydroxide) or placebo and then checked for 2 weeks to see how they reacted to the vaccine. if the researchers thought there were no safety concerns with this low dose, a new group of participants were treated with a middle dose (120 g) of rsvpref vaccine (with or without aluminum hydroxide) or placebo. these participants were then checked for 2 weeks to see how they reacted to the vaccine. if the researchers thought there were no safety concerns with the middle dose, another new group of participants were treated with a high dose (240 g) of rsvpref vaccine (with or without aluminum hydroxide) or placebo. these participants were then checked for 2 weeks to see how they reacted. if the researchers thought there were no safety concerns, the participants in the expanded cohort were given the low, middle, or high dose rsvpref vaccine (with or without aluminum hydroxide) as well as a flu vaccine or placebo at visit 1 and returned to the study center approximately 2 weeks after vaccination 1 for their visit 2 assessments. the participants in the expanded cohort then received a second injection at their second visit to the study center (visit 2), which was approximately 4 weeks after vaccination 1. in this cohort, if the participant was given rsvpref vaccine with or without aluminum hydroxide plus placebo at visit 1 then they were given flu vaccine at visit 2. if they received rsvpref vaccine with or without aluminum hydroxide plus flu vaccine at visit 1, they were given placebo at visit 2. if they received placebo only at visit 1, they were given flu vaccine at visit 2. some of the participants who received the high dose (240 g) of rsvpref vaccine (with or without aluminum hydroxide) as well as a flu vaccine in the expanded cohort were invited back to the study center 1 year later to be vaccinated again. the results of this revaccination study are described separately. the study included participants who were healthy and 18 through 85 years of age. the participants and most of researchers did not know who was given each type of vaccine and who was given placebo. only the person who gave the injections knew what vaccine each participant was given. this is known as an observer blinded study and this is done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way. participants in the sentinel cohort and the expanded cohort were put into groups by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups more similar. reducing differences between the groups (like the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare. while participants were only in the study for 12 months, the entire study took around 19 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 36 locations in the united states. it began on 18 april 2018 and ended on 20 november 2019. there were 462 men and 771 women between 18 and 85 years of age who participated and were vaccinated in this study. of the 1235 participants who started the study, 1135 were vaccinated and finished 12 months of medical checks. there were 98 participants who were vaccinated but did not have 12 months of medical checks. these participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. when the study ended in november 2019, the sponsor began reviewing all of the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results from the main study. this is a summary of that report. the results of the revaccination study are reported separately. "," STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 1/2 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding FIH study. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of up to 6 different RSV vaccine candidates at 3 escalating dose levels of 60 g CC and 240 g CCI I prefusion RSV F antigen, with or without Al(OH) , when administered 3 alone or concomitantly with SIIV. This study will utilize a sentinel cohort (Phase 1) and an expanded cohort (Phase 2) for each dose level in each age group (see Figure 1). In the sentinel cohort (Phase 1), subjects will be enrolled into 2 age groups:  Male and female subjects 18 to 49 years of age. In the expanded cohort (Phase 2), subjects will be enrolled into 2 age groups:  Male and female subjects 18 to 49 years of age. A single dose of RSV vaccine will be given to sentinel-cohort subjects to assess 3 escalating dose levels of the RSV vaccine candidate with or without Al(OH) . The first 4 subjects 3 vaccinated at the first site will be in the 18- to 49-year-old age group. These subjects must be observed by blinded site staff for at least 4 hours after vaccination for any acute reactions. Vaccination of the remaining subjects in both age groups will commence no sooner than 48 hours after the fourth subject received his or her vaccination. The expanded-cohort data will be used to assess the concomitant use of SIIV when given to subjects receiving 1 of 3 dose levels of the RSV vaccine candidate with or without Al(OH)3. In the expanded cohort, the relationship between serological parameters and a confirmed RSV infection and/or RSV-associated disease symptoms will be assessed and samples will be used to develop viral detection assays for future efficacy studies. In the sentinel cohort, subjects will receive a single intramuscular dose of the RSV vaccine candidate with or without Al(OH) or placebo. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to the sentinel group, starting at the 60-g dose level. For each age group, randomization into sentinel groups at the 120-g dose level will progress only if the 14-day safety and tolerability data reviewed by the IRC are deemed acceptable. For each age group, randomization progression to the 240-g dose level will take place only if the 14-day safety and tolerability data from the 120-g dose level are deemed acceptable by the IRC. For each age group, the IRC will recommend proceeding with randomization of subjects in the expanded cohort at dose levels where the safety data were deemed acceptable by the IRC (see Figure 1). One-month immunogenicity data from the sentinel group(s) may be used to determine if a dose level(s) can be discontinued from the expanded cohort. In the expanded cohort, subjects will be randomized equally across each dose level within each age group (see Table 2) via center-based randomization. Subjects in the expanded cohort will receive 2 intramuscular injections at Visit 1 and 1 intramuscular injection at Visit 2. Subjects in the expanded cohort will be asked to attend additional visits if they experience respiratory illness symptoms that last longer than 24 hours during the interval from Day 15 after Vaccination 1 until Visit 5. Subsequently, at approximately 12 months after Visit 1, selected subjects in the expanded cohort will be invited to participate in the revaccination stage. Subjects in the 240-g dose group who received an initial dose of the RSV vaccine with or without Al(OH) will be 3 revaccinated with the same dose and formulation of the RSV vaccine alone or concomitantly with SIIV. The SIIV or placebo assignment and the vaccination scheme will be the same as for the first year of the study. As a control, the placebo group will also be revaccinated with placebo alone and then followed by SIIV alone. Number of Subjects In total, up to approximately 1182 subjects will be randomized if all dose levels are administered to the expanded cohort. Up to approximately 168 healthy subjects will be randomized in the sentinel cohort and up to approximately 1014 healthy subjects will be randomized in the expanded cohort (see Table 1 and Table 2 below). In addition, approximately 390 subjects in the expanded cohort will be invited to participate in the revaccination stage of the study (see Table 3). An allocation target will not be set by sex; however, the intention is for sites to enroll at least 50% women within each dose level group in the sentinel and expanded cohorts of the 18- to 49-year age group. Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study after randomization will not be replaced, regardless of the reason for withdrawal. Duration of Subject Participation Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 12 months except the expanded-cohort subjects for revaccination, who will participate in the study for approximately 24 months. Duration of Study The approximate duration of each stage is anticipated to be as follows. As the subjects in the initial phase of the expanded cohort will receive SIIV, this phase of the study is dependent on SIIV availability and access to subjects who have not received SIIV within the preceding 6 months. It is anticipated that this phase of the study will be conducted in the same geographic location as the sentinel phase; however, if required for operational reasons, it is possible that sites in the opposite hemisphere may be used, or that this phase of the study may be conducted over more than 1 influenza season or in more than 1 geographic location."

" how was the study done? this study had 2 phases: a dose-finding and anti-tumour phase. the dose-finding phase also had two parts: different dose combinations of two pairs of the medications and different dose combinations of all 3 medications. the combinations of medications for each of the parts of the study were:  dose-finding phase: o 2 medications  800 mg avelumab (1 time every other week) and 45 mg binimetinib (2 times every day, every other week)  800 mg avelumab (1 time every other week) and 30 mg binimetinib (2 times every day, every other week)  45 mg binimetinib (2 times every day, every other week) and 0.75 mg talazoparib (1 time every day, every other week)  30 mg binimetinib (2 times every day, every other week) and 0.75 mg talazoparib (1 time every day, every other week) o 3 medications (planned, but not done)  anti-tumour phase (planned, but not done) in the dose-finding phase of the study, researchers tested the combination of avelumab and binimetinib or the combination of binimetinib and talazoparib on a group of study participants to find out if study participants had medical problems that could be the result of taking the medications at the same time. it was planned that groups of participants would take avelumab and binimetinib or binimetinib and talazoparib. when a safe dose was found, new participants would enter the study and take avelumab, binimetinib, and talazoparib together. however, this study was stopped before any participants joined the dose finding part with all 3 drugs taken together. the anti-tumor phase of the study was also not done. the study participants and researchers knew who took avelumab and binimetinib and who took talazoparib and binimetinib. this is known as an open label study. the sponsor ended this study during the 2-medication part of the dose-finding phase because it was not likely the dose levels the researchers wanted to use would be reached. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 10 locations in 3 countries in asia, europe, and north america. when did this study take place? it began on 15 august 2018 and ended on 02 february 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who were at least 18 years old, had been diagnosed with mpdac that had worsened following prior treatment, had at least 1 tumour that could be measured by doctor, and did not have other major health concerns.  a total of 19 men participated  a total of 16 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 42 and 83 years old most participants stopped taking the study medications because their disease got worse. all 35 participants stopped being in the study, mostly because they died, by their choice, or they were still in the study when it was ended early by the sponsor. how long did the study last? study participants received study treatment until their cancer got worse, they had serious medical problems that did not allow continued treatment with one or both of the study drugs, or by their choice. the entire study ran over 29 months before it was ended early by the sponsor. when the study was ended early by the sponsor in february 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Study Overview This is a Phase 1b/2, open label, multi-center, study of combinations of avelumab, binimetinib and talazoparib in eligible adult patients with mPDAC (regardless of KRAS status) and other locally advanced or metastatic KRAS- or NRAS-mutant solid tumors. Initially, this study examined avelumab given IV Q2W and binimetinib given BID on a continuous dosing schedule with the objective of identifying an RP2D for this doublet combination before proceeding to assess the triplet combination of avelumab, binimetinib and talazoparib. Per Amendment 3, the study will include a sequential dose-finding phase (Phase 1b) for binimetinib in combination with talazoparib (doublet) and avelumab in combination with binimetinib and talazoparib (triplet) followed by Phase 2. Upon the completion of the dose-finding for the doublet, the triplet of avelumab in combination with binimetinib and talazoparib will then be evaluated to determine the RP2D for this combination. Guidance for Phase 1b dosing (dose level to be evaluated in the next cohort) and enrollment (number of patients to be enrolled in the next cohort) decisions will be based on a BLRM. The BLRM incorporates single-agent and available combination DLT data (historical and prospectively across dose cohorts) to estimate the posterior probability of under-dosing, target dosing and overdosing, thereby reducing patient risk and increasing efficiency and precision during dose finding with combination treatments. Of note, for the D0, the risk of excessive toxicity was estimated to be 0.10 based on the information from prior single-agent Phase 1 studies and a PK assessment of no potential drug-drug interaction between avelumab and binimetinib. The starting dose level (BT0) is 45 mg binimetinib orally BID, Schedule 7d/7d, and talazoparib 0.75 mg orally, QD on a continuous dosing schedule, which satisfies the EWOC criterion35 that the risk for excessive toxicity be less than 0.25. Of note, for BT0, the risk of excessive toxicity was estimated to be 0.189 based on the information from prior single-agent Phase 1 studies30,9 and a PK assessment of no potential drug-drug interaction between binimetinib and talazoparib (see Appendix 6 Table 40). Dose-finding for the triplet of avelumab, binimetinib and talazoparib will begin once the RP2D for the doublet combination (Schedule 7d/7d binimetinib dosing) has been confirmed in at least 9 DLT-evaluable patients (see Section 9.1.3). The starting dose level for the triplet will be determined at the completion of the dose finding for the doublet combinations based on all available clinical data (including but not limited to safety and PK data) from the avelumab and binimetinib and binimetinib and talazoparib doublet dose-finding portions of this study and from the combination of avelumab and talazoparib (dose-finding component of study B9991025). If the doublet of binimetinib and talazoparib is well tolerated using Schedule 7d/7d for binimetinib with an RP2D of at least 45 mg binimetinib and 0.75 mg talazoparib, the combination of binimetinib (BID) administered on a more intensive dosing schedule (ie, 5 days on/2 days off; Schedule 5d/2d) with continuous talazoparib (QD) may also be explored in order to determine the RP2D for this combination. When all DLT-evaluable patients treated in a given enrollment cohort have completed the DLT observation period or experienced a DLT, whichever occurs first, the posterior distribution for the risk of DLT for new patients at different dose levels for the combination of interest will be evaluated. Phase 2 Design Once the Phase 1b part is completed and the RP2Ds for the doublet and triplet combinations have been determined, Phase 2 will be initiated to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of the RP2D for each drug combination. In the case that an RP2D is determined for the doublet combination using more than 1 binimetinib dosing schedule (ie, Schedules 7d/7d and 5d/2d), only one will be chosen to be evaluated in Phase 2 on the In addition to the above mPDAC tumor cohorts, 30 patients with other locally advanced or metastatic KRAS- or NRAS-mutant solid tumors (such as NSCLC, CRC, melanoma and endometrial cancer) will be enrolled in a tumor agnostic cohort to receive the triplet combination as this may provide clinical benefit to a broader population of patients than primarily planned for this study (ie, mPDAC). For the purpose of dose finding, any of the following AEs occurring in the first cycle of treatment which are attributable to any or all agents in the combination will be classified as DLTs: 3.2.1. Non-Hematologic  Grade 3 toxicities of any duration except:  Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and Grade 4 vomiting or diarrhea in the absence of maximal medical therapy that resolves in 72 hours;  Grade 3 fatigue lasting <5 days;  Grade 3 hypertension that can be controlled to Grade 2 within 14 days with or without ongoing medical therapy;  Grade 3 serum lipase and/or serum amylase without clinical signs or symptoms of  Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities without a clinical correlate and that do not require medical intervention;  Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities that do not represent a clinically relevant shift from baseline;  Grade 3 endocrinopathies controlled with hormonal therapy. While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in the context of Phase 1b are specified above, an AE not listed above, or an AE meeting the DLT criteria above but occurring outside of the DLT observation period may be defined as a DLT following assessment, based on the emerging safety profile for the combinations. Maximum Tolerated Dose Definition A dose level combination is a potential candidate for being the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) level when all the following criteria are met:  6 patients have been treated at that dose;  Probability of target dosing >50%; and  Probability of overdosing <25%."
" this study compared 4 groups of patients to find out if patients taking abrocitinib had their ad improved compared to patients taking a placebo, or patients taking dupilumab. the study included adult men and women, who were aged 18 years and older. patients included in the study:  had chronic (long-term) ad for at least 1 year, and had moderate to severe ad when they entered the study.  had used other treatments for ad and did not see their ad improve.  had not used other medicine on the skin for ad in the week before starting the study. the patients and researchers did not know who took abrocitinib and who took the placebo. this is known as a double-blinded study. this is done to make sure the results of the research study cannot be unfairly influenced by anyone. patients were put into 1 of 4 treatment groups by chance alone (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) to receive either abrocitinib 100 mg, abrocitinib 200 mg, dupilumab, or placebo. patients had a 29% (2 in 7) chance of receiving either abrocitinib 100 mg, abrocitinib 200 mg, or dupilumab, and a 14% (1 in 7) chance of receiving placebo for the study treatment period. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups more similar. reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare. this study used 2 different tests to measure the severity of the patients ad at the beginning of the study and throughout 20 weeks of treatment. the first test is called the investigators global assessment (iga) scale and measures the severity of ad on a 5-point scale (0 being the best and 4 being the worst). the second test is called the eczema area and severity index (easi), and measures how severe a patients ad is based on 4 different signs, as well as the amount of skin affected by ad. the difference in each patients score between the start of the study and after 12 weeks of treatment was used to decide if their ad had improved. while patients were only in the study for 20 to 24 weeks, the entire study took 16 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 194 locations in 18 countries in the us, poland, republic of korea, japan, australia, bulgaria, canada, germany, united kingdom, latvia, hungary, czech republic, chile, spain, italy, mexico, slovakia, and taiwan. it began 29 october 2018 and ended 06 march 2020. four-hundred nine (409) men and 428 women participated. all patients were 18 years of age or older. the average age of patients in this study was 34 years old. patients were to be treated until the end of the 20 weeks treatment period. of the 838 patients who started the study, 765 patients were continuing the study at week 16. one (1) patient was randomized, but did not receive treatment. twenty-four (24) patients did not finish the study because of medical problems. twenty-three (23) patients left before the study was over by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. in february 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of PF-04965842 100 mg or 200 mg QD and dupilumab (as per label) compared with placebo in adult subjects on background topical therapy, with moderate to severe AD. This study will provide a direct comparison of both doses of PF-04965842 with dupilumab in terms of pruritus relief. This study will also provide data which will estimate the relative efficacy of both doses of PF-04965842 and dupilumab. The treatment duration is 20 weeks. A total of approximately 700 subjects will be enrolled from approximately 270 sites globally. There is a primary efficacy assessment at Week 12, and key secondary efficacy assessments at Week 2 and Week 16. Efficacy and safety endpoints will be assessed throughout the entire study. A study design schematic is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Study Design Schematic a At Week 2 and Week 16, key secondary endpoints are measured. b At Week 12, primary endpoints are measured. c At Week 20, eligible subjects will enter the B7451015 long-term extension study; ineligible subjects will instead enter the 4-week off-treatment follow-up period in B7451029. Note: Standardized background topical therapy must be used as per protocol guidelines throughout the study. After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. Subjects will undergo screening within 28 days prior to randomization. During the screening period, systemic treatments and medicated topical therapy for AD will be washed out, as applicable, according to eligibility requirements. Eligible subjects must have a documented history, within 6 months of the screening visit, of inadequate response to treatment with medicated topical therapy for at least 4 weeks, or must have required systemic therapies for control of their disease. Eligible subjects must meet the eligibility criteria at both screening and baseline. In addition, subjects are required to use non-medicated topical willing and able to use standardized background topical therapy, as per protocol guidelines, throughout the duration of the study. Subjects may be re-screened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions. Subjects for whom screen failure is related to failing the disease severity (including extent of disease) inclusion criterion 3 and who subsequently experience worsening AD, which in the investigators judgement would make them eligible for participation, may be considered for re-screening. Such cases should be discussed with the Pfizer Medical Monitor (or designee) to determine if re-screening is appropriate. Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo Day 1 assessments and be randomized in a 4:4:4:1:1 ratio to receive 100 mg or 200 mg of PF-04965842 QD with dupilumab-matching placebo administered every other week , dupilumab 300 mg administered every other week (with a loading dose of 600 mg at baseline) with PF-04965842-matching placebo administered QD, or one of two sequences of PF-04965842-matching placebo administered QD with dupilumab-matching placebo administered every other week from Day 1, for 16 weeks followed by either 100 mg or 200 mg of PF-04965842 QD. Investigators, subjects, and the sponsor study team will be blinded as to treatment group. The total treatment period is 20 weeks. The first part of this treatment period consists of a 16-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy treatment period with subjects receiving both injectable and oral investigational product. The randomization and double-blind will be maintained during the final 4 weeks of the treatment period, but subjects will only receive oral investigational product. At Week 16 in the treatment period, all subjects will cease injectable dupilumab or its matching placebo. This is to facilitate the washout of dupilumab (for a total of 6 weeks; as the final dose of dupilumab or its matching placebo is administered at Week 14) prior to eligible subjects entering the long-term extension study, in which all subjects will receive PF-04965842 active treatment. As, following Week 16, data for the primary and key secondary efficacy assessments will have already been obtained, subjects previously receiving only placebo will receive PF-04965842 100 mg or 200 mg QD as per their randomized allocation. Subjects previously receiving PF-04965842 100 mg or 200 mg QD will continue on their respective dose. Subjects previously receiving dupilumab will continue to take oral placebo. These alterations to study treatment will all be conducted while maintaining the blind when re-issuing oral investigational product to all subjects at the Week 16 time point. Eligible subjects completing the entire 20-week treatment period of the study will have the option to enter a long-term extension (LTE) study, B7451015. In which all subjects will receive PF-04965842 active treatment. Subjects discontinuing early from treatment, or who are otherwise ineligible for the LTE study, will undergo a 4-week follow-up period in study B7451029."
" this study was done to learn about the safety and the antibody response to 20vpnc in participants 65 years old and older. the vaccines used in this study included 20vpnc, 13vpnc, and ppsv23. this study included adult men and women who:  were at least 65 years old  were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study doctors  did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a weakened immune system  never had a disease caused by s. pneumoniae  never had a severe medical problem caused by a vaccine or an allergic reaction to any of the components in the vaccines used in this study  had previously been vaccinated with 13vpnc and/or ppsv23 participants were placed into 3 categories based on which vaccines they had previously received:  category 1: received ppsv23 between 1 and 5 years before the study started, but had never received 13vpnc (375 participants)  category 2: received 13vpnc at least 6 months before the study started, but had never received ppsv23 (375 participants)  category 3: received 13vpnc followed by ppsv23 1 year later, and the ppsv23 dose had been received at least 1 year before the study started (125 participants) next, participants in category 1 and category 2 were assigned by chance alone to receive the following study vaccines:  category 1: 1 dose of either 20vpnc (253 participants) or 13vpnc (122participants)  category 2: 1 dose of either 20vpnc (248 participants) or ppsv23 (127 participants) a control group is a group of participants who do not receive the vaccine being studied. in this study, 13vpnc and ppsv23 were used as the controls to look at safety of 20vpnc because they are commonly used in this age group. this was a randomized study, which means that participants were assigned to groups based on chance alone. randomization is done to make the groups similar so that differences in antibody response or safety are most likely due to the different vaccines participants received. the participants who had been vaccinated with both 13vpnc and ppsv23 in the past (category 3, 125 participants) received 20vpnc only. this study was also open-label. this means that participants and study staff members who administered the vaccine knew who was given which vaccine. however, the researchers who did the antibody testing did not know this information until after the antibody testing was completed. participants were expected to participate in 3 study visits. at the first visit, participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study, blood samples were collected, and then participants received study vaccine. the second visit was done about 1 month after the first visit. participants were checked for medical problems and blood samples were collected. in the participants who received 20vpnc, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in the blood. the third visit (follow-up) was done over the phone about 6 months after the first visit. the participants were asked about medical problems and whether they had received any other vaccines besides the study vaccines. the figure below shows what happened during the study. while participants were in this study for about 6 months, the entire study took 1 year to complete as participants entered the study at different times. the sponsor ran this study at 33 locations in the united states and 8 locations in sweden. it began 12 february 2019 and ended 12 february 2020. 398 men (46%) and 475 women (54%) received the study vaccines. all participants were between the ages of 65 and 92 years. of the 875 participants who joined the study, 865 (99%) completed it. a total of 10 participants (1%) left the study early. the most common reasons for leaving early were the participants choice or because a doctor decided it was best for them to leave the study. throughout the course of the study, the sponsor reviewed the data. when the study ended in february 2020 and after antibody testing was completed on the participants who received 20vpnc, the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label study will be conducted at investigator sites in the United States and at least 1 European country. The purpose of the study is to describe the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC administered to adults 65 years of age who have been previously vaccinated with various pneumococcal vaccines to provide data in this population. A total of ~875 adults 65 years of age will be enrolled into 3 different cohorts based on their prior pneumococcal vaccination history. Subjects will be randomized to receive either 20vPnC or control vaccine (13vPnC in Cohort A, or PPSV23 in Cohort B) by site-based randomization within each cohort (see Table 1). In 2 of the 3 cohorts, a control group is CCI Subjects who have received PPSV23 1 to 5 years previously, but have not been vaccinated with 13vPnC, will be assigned to Cohort A and will be randomized (2:1) to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC. Subjects who have received 13vPnC 6 months previously, but have not been vaccinated with PPSV23, will be assigned to Cohort B and will be randomized (2:1) to receive either 20vPnC or PPSV23. Subjects who have previously received 13vPnC followed by PPSV23 (PPSV23 vaccination must have been given 1 year prior to vaccination in this study) will be assigned to Cohort C and will receive 20vPnC. Table 1. Vaccine Assignment a. Vaccinated with PPSV23 and no prior 13vPnC. b. Vaccinated with 13vPnC but no prior PPSV23. On Day 1 (Visit 1), subjects will be assessed for eligibility, have blood drawn for immunogenicity assessments in the 20vPnC group and for purposes of vaccine research in all subjects (see Section 7.2), and receive the study vaccination. Subjects will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination, and AEs occurring during that time (immediate AEs) will be recorded. Subjects will also receive safety follow-up and electronic diary (e-diary) instructions at the visit. Prompted systemic events (fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain) occurring within 7 days after vaccination, and prompted local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) occurring at the assigned vaccine (20vPnC, 13vPnC, or PPSV23) injection site within 10 days after vaccination, will be collected daily in the e-diary. Use of antipyretic/pain medications will also be prompted for and collected daily in the e-diary for 7 days after vaccination. Subjects will return for Visit 2 (28 to 42 days after Visit 1). Information will be collected from the subjects on AEs, SAEs, NDCMCs, and e-diary follow-up (as needed). Blood will also be drawn at this visit for immunogenicity assessments in the 20vPnC group and for At Visit 3 (approximately 6 months [168 to 196 days] after Visit 1), the sites will contact the subjects via telephone to inquire about SAEs, NDCMCs, concomitant medications used to treat SAEs or NDCMCs, and receipt of nonstudy vaccines. CCI 3.1. Duration of Subject Participation Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 6 months. 3.2. Duration of Study Based on a 5-month enrollment period, the study duration will be approximately 11 months. 3.3. Number of Subjects Enrollment of approximately 875 subjects will result in ~790 evaluable subjects (assuming a 10% dropout rate). Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study after randomization will not be replaced, regardless of the reason for withdrawal."
" this study compared 2 groups of participants to find out what happens to dacomitinib in the body of participants who have severe hepatic impairment compared to participants with no hepatic impairment. the study included adult participants who weighed more than 50 kg (110 lb) with severe hepatic impairment or with no hepatic impairment. participants were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups according to how well their liver was working. participants with severe hepatic impairment joined the study first and patients with no hepatic impairment joined afterwards. the researchers tried to match the 2 groups so that the average age and average body weight of each group were similar. this meant the 2 groups were similar except for how well their livers were working. all participants in the study took dacomitinib. while participants were only in the study for 8 days (i.e., from the day before treatment until 7 days after treatment), the entire study took just over 6 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 2 locations in the us. it began 05 april 2019 and ended 24 october 2019. 16 men participated and all were between the ages of 52 and 68 years. participants were admitted to the study unit the day before they were treated and had to stay overnight and not to eat during this time. this meant that when they were treated with a single dose of 30 mg dacomitinib they had not eaten for more than 10 hours. participants were then asked to stay in the study unit for 7 days. blood samples were taken during this time and they were asked how they felt. of the 16 patients who started the study, all finished the study. when the study ended in october 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Overall Design This will be a Phase 1, open-label, parallel-group study to investigate the effect of severe hepatic impairment on the plasma PK, safety and tolerability after a single oral 30 mg dose of dacomitinib under fasted conditions. At Screening, the modified Child-Pugh classification score as outlined in Appendix 8 will be utilized to assess entry criteria and to assign participants into the appropriate hepatic impairment group (Table 1). The modified Child-Pugh classification criteria will permit enrollment of participants with a history of Stage 3 or Stage 4 encephalopathy who are receiving medication(s) to prevent recurrent encephalopathy; participants with clinically active Stage 3 or 4 encephalopathy will be excluded from participation in the study. Hepatic Function Categories Based on Child-Pugh Classification Cohort Description Child-Pugh Score Number of Participants 1 Severe hepatic impairment Class C (10 to 15 points) 8 2 Normal hepatic function Not applicable 8a a. Participants in Cohort 2 may be dosed to a maximum of 10 participants to ensure that the age of each participant in Cohort 2 is within 10 years and the body weight is within 15 kg to the median age and median body weight of participants in Cohort 1, respectively. Approximately 18 participants will be enrolled into the study to ensure at least 6 PK evaluable (having data for estimating primary PK parameters for dacomitinib) participants in each cohort. The participants from the severely impaired hepatic function cohort will be recruited first, and a median value for age and weight will be determined for all evaluable participants across study sites in this cohort. Then the control participants from the normal hepatic function cohort will be recruited later such that the age of each participant in Cohort 2 is within 10 years and the body weight is within 15 kg of the median of the participants in the severe hepatic impairment cohort (Cohort 1). In this study, participants will be screened for participation within 28 days prior to the dosing of dacomitinib. Results from the Day -1 safety assessments will be reviewed along with the screening assessments and the participants recent medical history to ensure that each participant meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study as defined in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of this protocol, respectively. Participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study on Day -1 will be assigned a randomization number on Day 1 (see Section 6.3 for details), and will be enrolled into the study. Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, participants will be administered a single oral 30 mg dose of dacomitinib with approximately 240 mL (8 ounces) of ambient temperature water on the morning of Day 1. After the PK data from all participants with severe hepatic impairment (Cohort 1) have been reviewed, the Sponsor will notify the site if additional participants for Cohort 1 are required. Scientific Rationale for Study Design A parallel group design will be utilized to compare the dacomitinib PK between participants with normal hepatic function and participants with severely impaired hepatic function but are otherwise healthy. The participants from the severely impaired hepatic function cohort will be recruited first, then the participants from the normal hepatic function cohort will be recruited later to match the median demographics from severe hepatic impairment group. The modified Child-Pugh classification system will be the method used in this study to identify participants with severe hepatic impairment. Additionally, total bilirubin and AST will be assessed in this study as per the recommendations of the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group Criteria for assessment of hepatic impairment.2 This study is designed using a single dose of dacomitinib considering that single dose plasma PK of dacomitinib has been documented to be generally predictive of exposure at steady state. All participants enrolled in this study will receive 1 single oral 30 mg dose of dacomitinib administered as tablet(s). This sampling duration is also expected to be adequate for characterizing the elimination phase of the plasma dacomitinib concentration-time profile for participants with severe hepatic impairment, for whom the elimination half-life of dacomitinib may be prolonged. Only participants identified as an CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer (EM) or CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer (IM) will be included in the primary statistical analysis to evaluate the impact of severe hepatic impairment on dacomitinib plasma PK. Banked biospecimens will be collected for exploratory pharmacogenomics (PGx)/genomic analyses and retained in the Biospecimen Banking System (BBS), which makes it possible to better understand the investigational products (IPs) mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, tolerability, safety, and/or efficacy not anticipated prior to the beginning of the study. Justification for Dose In the current study, a single 30 mg oral dose of dacomitinib will be administered to participants with normal hepatic function or participants with severe hepatic impairment. The single oral dose of dacomitinib 30 mg is the same dose that was tested in the previously conducted hepatic impairment study of dacomitinib (Study A7471018), where this dose was well-tolerated in participants with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Hence previous investigations have indicated that mild and moderate hepatic impairment had no clinically relevant effects on dacomitinib PK, and no adjustment of starting dose is currently recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The AUC tau in participants receiving a single 30 mg dose is expected to be 7.5 to 9.6 fold lower than the exposure in patients receiving 45 mg QD at steady state. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including the last scheduled procedure shown in the SoA. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study."
" how was the study done? researchers tested pf-06826647 in groups of study participants during 2 periods of time: an investigational treatment period (weeks 0-16) and an extension treatment period (weeks 16-40).  participants were randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 4 doses of study medication (pf-06826647, oral daily dose of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg) during the investigational treatment period for up to 16 weeks. randomization means that participants were assigned to a treatment group by chance. twice as many participants were assigned to the placebo, pf-06826647 200 mg, or pf-06826647 400 mg groups compared to the pf-06826647 50 mg or pf-06826647 100 mg groups.  during the investigational treatment period, the study participants and researchers did not know who took pf-06826647 or who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. the treatment doses in the extension treatment period were also randomized and blinded.  all participants completing the 16-week investigational treatment period and who were able to continue to the 24-week extension treatment period (which was from week 16 to week 40) received oral daily doses of pf-06826647 (either 200 mg or400 mg). there was no placebo in the extension treatment period.  the participants continuing into the extension treatment period who were originally assigned to the pf-06826647 200 mg and pf-06826647 400 mg treatment groups continued to receive their same doses.  participants who received placebo, pf-06826647 50 mg, or pf-06826647 100 mg in the investigational treatment period were randomly assigned to receive either pf-06826647 200 mg or pf-06826647 400 mg during the extension treatment period. researchers then compared the results of study participants taking the study medication to the results of study participants taking a placebo. study design where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 36 locations in 4 countries in north america, europe, and asia. the study locations were in canada (7 locations), japan (6 locations), poland (6 locations), and the united states (17 locations). when did this study take place? it began on 27 june 2019 and ended on 26 november 2020. who participated in this study? the study included participants who were adults at least 18 years old, were diagnosed with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months, and had stopped other psoriasis treatments.  a total of 122 men participated (69% of participants)  a total of 56 women participated (31% of participants)  all participants were between the ages of 18 years old and 72 years old participants were to be treated in the investigational treatment period until week 16. of the 179 participants who started the study, 153 participants (85%) finished the investigational treatment period. one (1) participant of the 179 participants who started the study was not treated and is not counted in the number who were treated; 178 participants were treated in the investigational treatment period. 25 participants (14%) did not finish the investigational treatment period because:  8 participants (4%) had a medical problem  3 participants (2%) left before the study was over for other reasons  1 participant (1%) did not respond to the study medication  1 participant (1%) was lost to follow-up  1 participant (1%) had an unplanned change to the study design  11 participants (6%) left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. a total of 153 participants entered the extension treatment period (week 16 to week 40). a total of 152 of these participants were treated in the extension treatment period, and 130 (85%) participants completed the extension treatment period. 23 participants (13%) did not finish the extension treatment period because:  8 participants (5%) had a medical problem  1 participant (1%) left because of pregnancy  7 participants (4%) left before the study was over by their choice  7 participants (4%) left before the study was over for other reasons how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for 16 weeks during the investigational treatment period and 24 weeks during the extension treatment period for a total of 40 weeks, plus a screening period of up to 6 weeks and a follow-up period of 4 weeks. the entire study took about 1  years to complete.  the study was completed as planned, including during the covid-19 pandemic period.  7 participants left the study during the covid-19 pandemic period (2 in the investigational treatment period and 5 during the extension treatment period); the data from these 7 participants were not analyzed for this report.  5 participants reported missed doses or delayed doses due to the pandemic. when the study ended in november 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," After a screening period of - up to 6 weeks, eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1:1:2:2 ratio such that participants will receive placebo or either one of four PF-06826647 daily dose levels (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg or 400 mg) every day during the Investigational Treatment Period for 16 weeks in a blinded fashion. All participants completing the 16-week Investigational Period will continue to a 24-week non-placebo-controlled Extension Treatment Period with double blind oral daily treatment, if per the Investigator judgment the participant is compliant with study procedures and continued participation presents no safety risks. The participants continuing into the Extension Treatment Period that were originally randomized to the 200 mg and 400 mg treatment groups will continue their respective doses, while those randomized to one of the other treatment groups (including placebo) will be randomly assigned (at study baseline) to receive either 200 mg or 400 mg during the Extension Treatment Period. Approximately 160 participants (40 participants in each of the following arms: placebo, 200 mg, and 400 mg; and 20 participants in each of the following arms: 50 mg and 100 mg) will be randomly assigned to a treatment group in order to ensure a minimum of 128 evaluable participants completing Week 16 (assuming a 20% dropout rate). The total duration of study participation will be approximately 50 weeks, including up to 6 weeks Screening Period, 16-week Investigational Treatment Period, the 24-week Extension Treatment Period and a Follow-Up visit 4 weeks after the Extension Treatment Period. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study is being conducted to provide data on efficacy, safety, tolerability, CCI of PF-06826647 in the oral treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The treatment duration of 16 weeks in this Phase 2 study (C2501004) will allow for further exploration of the clinical safety and efficacy that was observed in the 4-week Phase 1 (C2501001) study in a small (n=40) number of psoriasis participants. In order to further characterize the dose-response relationship, this study will explore 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg for 16 weeks during the Investigational Treatment Period of the study. Based on the exposure-response modeling with the PASI data observed up to Week 4, the projected PASI 90 response rates at 200 mg and 400 mg are 47% and 83% at Week 16 respectively, while 50 mg and 100 mg are expected to provide <15% PASI 90 response rate. Furthermore, participants randomized to placebo, 50 mg, and 100 mg doses during the Investigational Treatment Period will receive either 200 mg or 400 mg during the Extension Study Period in order to evaluate additional safety, tolerability, and durability of response to PF-06826647 at expected clinically efficacious doses. The potential risk of exposure to PF-06826647 in a sexual partner of a male participant in this study via ejaculate is low, and therefore no barrier contraception (condom) use in male participants is warranted. Four dosing (50 mg QD, 100 mg QD, 200 mg QD and 400 mg QD) regimens of PF-06826647 and placebo were selected to explore the dose range in moderate to severe psoriasis participants given the practical considerations. CCI Based on the exposure-response modeling with the PASI data observed up to Week 4, the projected PASI 90 response rates of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg were 3%, 13%, 47%, and 83% at Week 16, respectively. Although the projected PASI 90 response rates of 50 mg QD is low, the projected average inhibition (Table 3) based on in vitro IC value 50 determined by phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (pSTAT) modulation in human whole blood, red blood cell (RBC) partition ratio of 1.4 and assuming Hill coefficient of 1, the average daily inhibition of IL-12, IL-23, IFN is approximately 82%, 69% and 79%, respectively. Although, the projected average inhibition of erythropoietin (EPO) (Table 3) was 67% and a transient decrease in reticulocyte was observed in psoriasis participants at 400 mg QD, no clinically meaningful change in hemoglobin was observed at the same dose for 28 days in psoriasis participants. The As shown in the Table 3, highest dose of 400 mg QD at steady state is expected to provide margins of about 2-fold for C and about 3-fold for AUC relative to the total exposure max (NOAEL) in the monkey 9-month chronic toxicity study. The Phase 1 study (C2501001) demonstrated an acceptable safety profile at single doses of PF-06826647 ranging from 3 mg to 1600 mg in the single ascending portion and ten-day doses from 10 mg to 1200 mg daily in the multiple ascending portion of the study. The 200 mg and 400 mg doses were selected for the Extension Treatment Period due to the higher projected PASI 90 response rates at these doses. Based on the exposure-response modeling with the PASI data observed up to Week 4, the projected PASI 90 response rates at 200 mg and 400 mg are 47% and 83% at Week 16 respectively, while 50 mg and 100 mg are expected to provide <15% PASI 90 response rate.

"," STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel treatment group, efficacy and safety study designed to characterize the dose response of PF-06700841 in subjects with active PsA. A total of approximately 196 subjects will be randomized in a 4:4:1:1:2:2 ratio to one of the six parallel treatment sequences as shown below. The primary efficacy endpoint is the ACR20 response rate at Week 16. For the treatment comparison of each of three active treatment regimens (60 mg QD, 30 mg QD and 10 mg QD) versus placebo in the primary endpoint, this results in a 2:2:1:2 allocation ratio (in the order of 60 mg QD, 30 mg QD, 10 mg QD and placebo). A schematic of the study design is shown below: Figure 1. Schematic of Study Design The study consists of a screening period of up to 5 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 52 weeks (ie, one year), including a placebo controlled phase from Day 1 to Week 16 visits and an extended active treatment phase from Week 17 through Week 52, and a safety follow-up period of 4 weeks from last dose of study drug to last study visit. The total duration of study subject participation will be approximately 61 weeks, including the screening period and follow-up period. All eligible subjects must have active PsA despite previous or current treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and/or non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or apremilast. Some subjects (up to 30% of study population) may also have been previously treated with no more than one TNF inhibitor (TNFi). Randomization will be stratified by prior TNFi exposure. All subjects will randomly be assigned to one of the six treatment sequences (A-F) shown in Table 1. Starting after the Week 16 visit, subjects receiving the 60 mg QD dose (sequence A) or the 30 mg QD dose (sequence B) will continue on their initial dose; while all other subjects, including those from the 10 mg QD dose arm (sequences C and D) and placebo arm (sequences E and F), will start to randomly receive either the 60 mg QD dose or 30 mg QD dose until Week 52, as predetermined at randomization. All subjects will receive blinded dosing throughout the 52 weeks study treatment period in order to maintain the study blind. Table 1. Treatment Sequence 1. Starting after the Week 16 visit, subjects randomized to treatment sequences C or E will receive PF-06700841 60 mg QD in a blinded fashion for the remainder of the study.

" how was the study done? researchers tested the rsvpref vaccine on groups of pregnant women to find out if participants given this vaccine had local reactions or systemic events within 7 days after vaccination. the researchers also wanted to know about medical problems within 1 month after vaccination, if there were any complications during pregnancy and/or childbirth, if there were any serious medical problems or medical problems that prompted the participant to see a doctor during the study. researchers also wanted to see what happened if participants were given a placebo vaccine instead of the rsvpref vaccine. a placebo vaccine does not have any active ingredients in it, but it is given as an injection in the same way as the rsvpref vaccine. the rsvpref vaccine was given as an injection at 2 different doses. these doses were either 120 micrograms (written as 120 g) or 240 micrograms (written as 240 g). some of the rsvpref vaccines also contained aluminum hydroxide. blood samples were also collected during the study to see if participants developed rsvpref antibodies after the vaccination. the researchers then compared the results between participants vaccinated with rsvpref and placebo. participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. only the person who prepared the injections knew what vaccine each pregnant woman was given. this is known as an observer blinded study and this is done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way. the participants and researchers did not know who was given each type of rsvpref vaccine and who was given placebo. during the study, participants were asked to record information about local reactions and systemic events in a study diary. the health of participants and their infants, including collecting information about new medical problems, was checked regularly by staff at the study center throughout the study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 61 locations in 4 countries (argentina, chile, south africa, and the united states). when did this study take place? it began 07 august 2019 and ended 30 september 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who were healthy pregnant women and their infants once born.  a total of 579 women participated and were vaccinated  a total of 572 infants were born to women in the study  all women were between the ages of 18 and 42 years  it was planned that infants would stay in the study from birth to 12 months of age of the 778 participants who were screened to see if they could join the study, 581 women were randomized, and 579 were given a single vaccination; 572 infants were born during the study. out of the original 579 participants, there were 521 women and 519 infants who completed the study. most of the women participants and their infants who did not finish the study were lost to follow-up or no longer wanted to continue in the study. lost to follow-up means the study center was not able to contact the participants to check on their health or the health of the infant. how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for up to 17 months (depending on when they were vaccinated during the pregnancy and for approximately 12 months after childbirth). the entire study took almost 26 months or a little longer than 2 years to complete. when the study ended in september 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 4. STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This is a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study in which up to 650 healthy pregnant women 18 and 49 years of age will be randomized to receive one of 2 dose levels of bivalent (RSV A and B) RSV vaccine candidate at 120 g (60 g A and 60 g B) and 240 g (120 g A and 120 g B) of the prefusion RSV F antigen, formulated with or without Al(OH) , or placebo (1:1:1:1:1 randomization). Assessments will 3 include descriptions of safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in maternal participants as well as safety and characteristics of transplacentally transferred antibodies in their infants. CCI mothers will occur at a time of year such that the infant is likely to be exposed to RSV during the first 6 months of life. The first 5 maternal participants vaccinated in the study will be observed for at least 4 hours after investigational product administration for any acute reactions. Dosing of the remaining maternal participants will commence no sooner than 48 hours after the fifth maternal participant received her vaccination. The immediate postvaccination observation period for all maternal participants after the first 5 will be at least 30 minutes. It is anticipated that this study may be conducted in more than 1 geographic location including sites in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Enrollment will be monitored to help ensure distribution of vaccination across the gestational age range of 24 0/7 and 36 0/7 weeks. This study will use stopping rules. An IRC and an E-DMC will monitor safety in this study (see Section 9.5.2). 4.1.1. Approximate Duration of Participation for Each Participant Pregnant women will participate in the study from enrollment during their pregnancy, and for approximately 12 months after delivery of their infants. The total duration will be up to approximately 17 months depending on gestational age at the time of vaccination. Infants will participate from the time of birth and for approximately 12 months after birth. Pregnant women will be vaccinated at a time of year such that the infant is likely to be exposed to RSV during the first 6 months of life. 4.1.2. Approximate Number of Participants Up to 650 healthy pregnant women will be randomized. Approximately 500 women will be randomized in the northern hemisphere and up to 150 additional women will be randomized in the southern hemisphere. Enrollment will be monitored to help ensure distribution of vaccination across the gestational age range of 24 0/7 and 36 0/7 weeks. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design Refer to Section 2.1. 4.3. Justification for Dose The doses of vaccine that will be used in this study were determined following assessment of safety and immunogenicity data from the first-in-human (FIH) study, Study C3671001. The FIH study is designed to describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of up to 6 different RSV vaccine candidates with bivalent formulations (RSV A and B) at 3 escalating dose levels of 60 g (30 g A and 30 g B), 120 g (60 g A and 60 g B), and 240 g (120 g A and 120 g B) of the prefusion RSV F antigen, with or without Al(OH) when 3 administered alone or concomitantly with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine. The study utilizes a sentinel cohort (N=168; Phase 1) and an expanded cohort (N=1014; Phase 2). Female and male study participants of 2 age groups 18 through 49 years of age and 50 through 85 years of age are being enrolled into both cohorts. The age groups are being run in parallel. An interim analysis of the sentinel data from the FIH study shows a trend toward increasing neutralizing antibody responses for RSV A and RSV B antigens with increasing dose 2 weeks and 1 month after vaccination. The dose response is most apparent when comparing the 120-g and 240-g doses, and the highest vaccine responses are generally observed in study participants who received the highest antigen dose, particularly in those who received 240 g of antigen with Al(OH) . Of note, with small numbers of participants in each group 3 (11 or 12), there is still considerable variability. The initial safety data show a benign overall safety profile and no dose response in local reactions, systemic events, or AEs. The proposed primary mechanism for protection of infants by the RSV maternal vaccine is neutralization of the virus by transplacentally transferred antibody, which is increased by immunization. Maternal antibody decays exponentially in infants. Therefore, it is anticipated that higher titers of transferred neutralizing antibodies will provide greater levels and durations of infant protection. Based on the totality of preclinical and clinical data obtained to date, and given the absence of any sign of dose response in measures of safety or reactogenicity in the FIH study, it is proposed to test 120-g and 240-g antigen doses of the bivalent RSV vaccine candidate, with and without Al(OH) , in pregnant women. These 3 doses are expected to provide the greatest potential level of transplacental antibody transfer to infants and, therefore, the greatest potential benefit. 4.4. End of Study Definition The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study."
" this study compared 5 groups of participants to learn about the safety of rsvpref when given alone and together with tdap in healthy, nonpregnant women, and to learn whether giving rsvpref and tdap together changes how either vaccine works. participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. this study included adult women who:  were between the ages of 18 and 49 years  were not pregnant or breastfeeding  were considered to be healthy or with stable chronic disease by the study doctors  did not have a disease or take medicine that would be associated with a weakened immune system  had never received any vaccine for rsv  had not received a dtap or td (tetanus and diphtheria) vaccine within 5 years  had never had an allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the study vaccines this was a randomized study, which means that participants were assigned to 1 of 5 groups based on chance alone. randomization is done to make the groups similar so that differences in immune response or safety are most likely due to the different vaccines people received. this study was also double-blinded. this means that participants and study staff members assessing safety did not know who was given which injection. this was done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way. the vaccine combinations were given as 2 injections at the same time (one in each arm). some of the rsvpref vaccines also contained aluminum hydroxide, an ingredient that is commonly included in vaccines to help make the immune response stronger. the combinations included:  low dose rsvpref and placebo (143 participants)  low dose rsvpref and tdap (143 participants)  high dose rsvpref + aluminum hydroxide and placebo (143 participants)  high dose rsvpref + aluminum hydroxide and tdap (143 participants)  placebo and tdap (141 participants) participants were expected to participate in 2 study visits. at the first visit, blood samples were collected, and the participants received the injections. the second visit was done about 1 month after the first visit. blood samples were collected, and participants were checked for any medical problems. the figure on the following page shows what happened during the study. while participants were in this study for about 4 to 5 weeks, the entire study took about 2 months to complete since not all participants entered the study at the same time. the sponsor ran this study at 16 locations in the united states. it began 01 october 2019 and ended 11 december 2019. all participants were women between the ages of 18 and 49 years. of the 713 participants who joined the study, 709 (99%) received study injections. a total of 695 participants (97%) completed both study visits, while 14 participants (2%) did not complete both visits and left the study early by their choice. throughout the course of the study, the sponsor reviewed the data. when the study ended in december 2019 and after antibody testing was completed, the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

Overall Design This will be a Phase 2b, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blind study in which approximately 710 healthy nonpregnant women, 18 through 49 years of age, will be randomized to evaluate concomitant administration of the RSV vaccine and a US-licensed Tdap. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the following 5 schedules: 120 g RSV vaccine antigen CCI + sWFI with concomitant Tdap, 120 g RSV vaccine antigen + sWFI with placebo, 240 g RSV vaccine antigen CCI + Al(OH) and concomitant Tdap, 240 g RSV vaccine 3 antigen + Al(OH) and placebo, or placebo and Tdap. Please refer to Table 1. 3 Safety will be assessed through 1 month after vaccination. Immune responses to the RSV vaccine and Tdap antigens will be measured 1 month after vaccination. Participants will take part in the study from enrollment up to approximately 1 month after vaccination. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design Refer to Section 2.1. 4.3. Justification for Dose The doses of vaccine that will be used in this study were determined following assessment of safety and immunogenicity data from the interim analysis of the first-in-human (FIH) study (C3671001).

Female and male study participants 18 to 49 years of age and 50 to 85 years of age (sentinel cohort) and 18 to 49 years of age and 65 to 85 years of age (expanded cohort) were enrolled. The FIH study is designed to describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of up to 6 RSV vaccine candidates CCI at 3 escalating dose levels of 60 g CCI 120 g CCI and 240 g CCI of the prefusion RSV F antigen, with or without Al(OH) , when 3 administered alone or concomitantly with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine. An interim analysis of the data from the ongoing FIH study showed a trend toward increasing neutralizing antibody responses for RSV A and RSV B antigens with increasing dose 2 weeks and 1 month after vaccination. The dose response is most apparent when comparing the 120-g and 240-g doses, and the highest vaccine responses are generally observed in study participants who received the highest antigen dose. The initial safety data show a benign overall safety profile and no dose response in local reactions, systemic events, or AEs. RSV dosages in this study encompass the range of doses and formulations that will be used in the planned Phase 3 studies. 120 g of RSV vaccine without Al(OH) is most likely less 3 immunogenic and reactogenic, thus resulting in the lowest immunological interference and least increase of reactogenicity when coadministered with Tdap. 240 g of RSV vaccine with Al(OH) is at the other end of the spectrum, with possible risk of higher reactogenicity 3 and vaccine-to-vaccine immune-response interference when coadministered with Tdap. 4.4.

The sponsor (or designee) will provide home visits by qualified home visit practitioners (HVP), remote contact by telemedicine, and clinical database electronic case report forms (eCRFs), eDiary, and other electronic data entries from 3rd party vendors for study data collection. Participants who withdraw from further study intervention treatment (but do not withdraw consent for further data gathering) should continue to complete all scheduled assessments at the EOT visit and complete the follow-up phase of the study. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design SD prevalence is up to 2% in the 5th decade of life, 6-7% in the 6th decade of life, and more than 20% beyond age 70 years.1,2 Eligible participants must be 45 years or older. Potentially eligible study participants will have one or more concurrent medical conditions which predispose20,21 to lymphedema or VI and VHTN resulting in SD lesions: morbid obesity, COPD, coronary artery disease/CHF, DVT with or without IVC filter placement, diabetes mellitus, and varicose veins of the lower extremities. Extrapolating from AD clinical trial efficacy data for BID crisaborole applications, efficacy by Week 6 in participants with SD may be expected. It is relevant to note that active skin ulceration may be observed in close proximity to SD-affected skin. Because active skin ulcers may require more than 3 months of debridement and wound repair treatments, participants with SD and active skin ulcers will be excluded from study participation.12,13,18 4.3. Justification for Dose The crisaborole dose strength and regimens selected for this study have been demonstrated to be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in participants with mild to moderate AD in previous clinical trials (see the Investigators Brochure [IB]). Crisaborole ointment, 2%, BID is proposed as an appropriate dose strength and regimen based on the favorable benefit: risk profile established in mild to moderate AD for patients age 3 months and older. The 2% dose strength is the maximum feasible for the ointment formulation. 4.4. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including the End of Study (follow-up) visit. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study."
" how was the study done? researchers tested humira alone, compared with switching between humira and abrilada multiple times in 2 groups of study participants with ra to find out if switching between humira and abrilada changes how adalimumab acts in the body. participants were treated with humira or abrilada, which was given as an injection under the skin. the study doctor or nurse showed the participants or their care giver how to do the injection, then the participants were to give themselves the injections at home. the dose of humira and abriladawas 40 milligrams (mg) every other week. in addition, participants were required to continue taking methotrexate as prescribed by their doctor. researchers took samples of blood from participants during the study and measured the amount of adalimumab. researchers also checked the participants health during the study and asked them how they were feeling. researchers then compared the results of study participants who switched between humira and abrilada (switching arm) to the results of study participants who only took humira (non-switching arm). participants were assigned to the switching arm or the non-switching arm by chance alone. the participants and researchers knew who took each type of medicine. this is known as an open-label study. this study was split up into 4 treatment periods and 1 safety follow-up period as follows:  in treatment period 1 and treatment period 3, all participants received humira. treatment period 1 was for 10 weeks and treatment period 3 was for 6 weeks  in treatment period 2 and treatment period 4, participants in the switching arm received abriladaand participants in the non-switching arm received humira. treatment period 2 was for 6 weeks and treatment period 4 was for 10 weeks  in the safety follow-up period, treatment withabriladain the switching arm and humira in the non-switching arm was stopped and all participants remained in the study for a further 4 weeks for safety checks the following figure shows what happened during the study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 61 locations in 10 countries in europe, northern asia, south africa, and north america. when did this study take place? it began 13 january 2020 and ended 22 june 2021. who participated in this study? the study included adult participants who had moderately to severely active ra and who were also taking methotrexate. in treatment period 1:  a total of 77 men participated  a total of 368 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 20 and 71 years. of these 445 participants, 427 were treated in treatment period 2. in treatment period 2:  a total of 73 men participated  a total of 354 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 20 and 71 years. of the 445 participants who started the study, 427 finished treatment with humira in treatment period 1 and 18 stopped treatment early. of the 427 participants who continued the study in treatment periods 2 to 4, there were 213 participants who were treated in the switching arm with humira and abrilada and 214 participants who were treated in the non-switching arm with humira alone. of the 213 in the switching arm, 201 participants finished the study, and 12 stopped treatment early. of the 214 participants in the non-switching arm, 194 finished the study, and 20 stopped treatment early. there were 50 participants who stopped treatment early by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for 36 weeks. the entire study took nearly 18 months to complete. when the study ended in june 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 4. STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This is an open-label, multi-national, 2-arm, randomized, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the interchangeability of the switching arm (PF-06410293 and Humira), compared to non-switching arm (Humira), in participants with moderately to severely active RA on background methotrexate (MTX). For purposes of this protocol, the treatment arm that includes switches between PF-06410293 and Humira will be referred to as the switching arm, while the treatment arm that comprises continuous Humira treatment will be referred to as the non-switching arm. This study will enroll a maximum of approximately 420 participants such that approximately 314 evaluable participants complete the study. Study treatment will be provided through 4 treatment periods. For the first 10 weeks, all participants will receive Humira [Treatment Period (TP) 1]. Upon completion of TP1, participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) into either the switching or the non-switching arm prior to dosing on Week 10. Randomization will be stratified by 3 body weight groups (Week 10 weight) (40 kg to <70 kg; 70 kg to <100 kg; 100 kg to 130 kg). Participants randomized to the non-switching arm will continue on Humira for the remainder of the study, and participants randomized to the switching arm will continue switching in each TP (TP2: PF-06410293; TP3: Humira; TP4: PF-06410293).  TP1 (Lead In Period) will begin with the first dose of investigational product on Week 0 (Day 1) and conclude with the completion of Week 10 pre-dose assessments.  TP2 will begin with the 1:1 randomization of the participants to either the switching arm or the non-switching arm at Week 10. Investigational product dosing for Week 10 will begin after the randomization process in the respective treatment arms  TP3 will begin with investigational product dosing on Week 16, and conclude with the completion of Week 22 pre-dose assessments.  TP4 will begin with investigational product dosing on Week 22 and continue through Week 30, where onsite investigational product dosing is scheduled at Weeks 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30, followed by a 2-week PK sampling period from Week 30 to Week 32. TP4 will conclude with end of treatment (EoT) assessments and final dose administration at Week 32.  The 2-week PK sampling period starts with Week 30 predose PK collection and ends with predose PK collection on Week 32.  Safety Follow-Up Period begins after the last investigational product dosing on Week 32, and concludes at completion of the Week 36 assessments. All participants (including early discontinuations) will be followed for at least 28 calendar days from the date of their last dosed investigational product. Week 36 safety follow up may be conducted via phone. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study design is consistent with recommendations outlined in the FDA Interchangeability guidance7 and FDA Clinical Pharmacology guidance 2016.9 These recommendations include lead-in period, switching and non-switching treatment arms, for which the switching arm should have at least 3 switches between the biosimilar and reference products. Furthermore, the duration of each treatment period should be sufficient to establish PK steady state, with PK samples collected at the end of the last treatment period in both treatment arms for determination of steady state PK parameters. PK parameters should be analyzed using a standard bioequivalence (BE) approach with acceptance margins of 80.00% to 125.00%. Specific details regarding statistical approaches to data analysis for this study are discussed further in Section 9. This study is also designed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity after several investigational product switches between the switching and non-switching arms. 4.3. Justification for Dose The 40 mg dose is the recommended dose for RA participants in the HUMIRA and PF-06410293 labels for moderately to severely active RA patients. Dose modification is not allowed in this trial to avoid potential confounding factors that could impact ADA formation and PK, as well as safety (see Section 6.6). 4.4. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all treatment periods of the study, including the EoT visit (Week 32). The final safety follow-up is at Week 36, which may be done by phone. Early discontinuation from investigational product for an EoT visit. A safety follow-up (may be done by phone) at least 28 calendar days after the last investigational product is also required. The end of the study is defined when the last participant in the trial completes the date of last scheduled visit or contact as shown in the SoA."
" how was the study done? researchers tested 3 different doses of dex (low, middle, and high dose) on a group of study participants to find out if this treatment made participants feel calm and drowsy and so better able to remain still during the mri. dex is given as an injection into a blood vessel in the body during the mri. researchers then compared the results of study participants given high dose dex to the results of study participants given low dose dex. they did this to see how many participants taking these doses of dex did not need propofol. after the mri, participants were checked regularly in a recovery area until they met criteria that indicated they were ready to leave. participants were then contacted to check on their health the following day and after about a month. the study participants and researchers did not know who received the low, middle, or high dose dex. this is known as a blinded study. study participants were assigned to each dose of dex by chance alone, like flipping a coin. the following figure shows what happened in this study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 22 locations in the us and japan. when did this study take place? it began 18 february 2020 and ended 30 november 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who needed sedation during an mri.  a total of 63 boys participated  a total of 59 girls participated  all participants were between the ages of 2 months and just over 15 years participants were to be treated with dex during the mri on day 1. of the 122 participants who began treatment with dex, 117 completed treatment, and all 122 participants finished the study. five (5) participants stopped treatment with dex, including 3 participants for medical reasons during the mri (1 participant with low dose dex, 1 participant with middle dose dex, and 1 participant with high dose dex) and 2 participants for other reasons (both with high dose dex). how long did the study last? each study participant was in the study for about 1 month. the entire study took almost 22 months to complete. the study ended in november 2021. the sponsor reviewed all information collected and created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging study of the efficacy and safety of DEX, when used with PRO as needed, for procedural sedation of pediatric subjects 1 month to <17 years of age undergoing MRI scans. The sponsor, subject and investigator will be blinded to the dose of DEX. This study includes a Screening, Day 1, Day 2 Follow-up and Day 29 Long-term Follow-up Visit. The Day 1 Visit is comprised of a Period 1(MRI scan) Phase and a Period 2 (Post- MRI Recovery) Phase. The Day 2 Visit is a 24-hour Follow-up, and the Day 29 Visit is a 28- day Follow-up. All eligible subjects will receive double-blind treatment where one of 3 dose levels of DEX will be administered. Following completion of required procedures before randomization at the Day 1 Visit, subjects meeting entry criteria will be randomly assigned to a Low, Middle or High dose level group (actual dose dependent on age) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment will be initiated just prior to the start of the MRI scan and will continue during Period 1 (MRI scan). Subjects will first receive a DEX loading dose administered over 10 minutes. Following completion of the loading dose, the maintenance infusion of DEX will be started. The subjects level of sedation will be assessed using the Pediatric Sedation State Scale (PSSS) at 5-minute intervals throughout the drug infusion and MRI scan. If an adequate level of sedation is not achieved as assessed by the investigator (eg, if the subject moves) within 5 minutes after the DEX maintenance infusion has been started, concomitant PRO may be given to ensure that an adequate sedation level is achieved and maintained for completion of the scan. The target sedation level is indicated by a PSSS score of 2 (ie, patient is quiet [asleep or awake], not moving during procedure, has no frown [or brow furrow] indicating pain or anxiety and no verbalization of any complaint).27 Once the subject has achieved an adequate sedation level per principal investigator (PI) clinical judgment, the MRI scan can commence. Sedation with DEX and if required, concomitant PRO, shall continue through completion of the MRI scan to maintain the subject at an adequate sedation level per PI clinical judgment. Subjects will also be administered supplemental IV fluids throughout the DEX infusion at a maintenance rate per Section 5.10.1 Required Treatments. Please refer to the Investigational Product Manual (IP Manual) for the list of permitted IV fluids that may be used. The use, type and rate of maintenance fluid administration following discontinuation of the DEX infusion will be at the sites discretion. During subject sedation, facilities for maintenance of a patent airway, provision of artificial ventilation, administration of supplemental oxygen and cardiovascular resuscitation must be immediately available. Site personnel trained in the use of resuscitative drugs and emergency equipment and skilled in airway management must be available at all times during subject sedation. The DEX infusion should not be discontinued until confirmation that the MRI is complete has been received and DEX must be discontinued prior to the subject being transferred to the post-procedural recovery area. Period 2 (post-MRI recovery) begins at the conclusion of the MRI scan. The study will be conducted using the manufactured strength of DEX 200 mcg/2 mL, diluted to a concentration directed by the Investigational Product Manual (IP Manual) based on each subjects treatment group assignment. 3.1. Approximate Duration of Subject Participation Subjects will participate in the study for ~4 weeks. 3.2. Approximate Number of Subjects A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 120 subjects (40 subjects per dose level) who will participate in the study. The numbers of enrolled subjects are not pre-specified for each participating country. Enrollment is competitive and will depend on the capabilities of each site. Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  Age Cohort 1 month to <2 years: This age cohort should have an even distribution of subjects between the ages of 1 month to <2 years on Day 1 within each dose group:  Approximately 10 subjects aged 1 month to <1 year in each dose group.  Approximately 10 subjects aged 1 year to <2 years in each dose group.  Age Cohort 2 years to <17 years: This age cohort should have an even distribution of subjects between the ages of 2 years to <12 years on Day 1 within each dose group:  Approximately 8 subjects aged 2 years to <6 years in each dose group.  Approximately 8 subjects aged 6 years to <12 years in each dose group.  Approximately 4, but no more than 5 subjects aged 12 years to <17 years in each dose group.  All age cohorts can be enrolled in parallel."

"," Overall Design Study B7981037 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled safety study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06651600, including the assessment of BAEP and IENF, in adults with 25% scalp hair loss due to AA. Approximately 60 adults 18 to 50 years of age will be randomized 1:1 to receive either PF-06651600 or placebo. If there are issues related to the integrity of some peripheral nerve punch biopsy samples, up to an additional 20 participants may be added at the discretion of the Sponsor to ensure adequate numbers of participants with interpretable biopsies. The total duration of participation in the study will be approximately 26 months. This includes up to a 5-week screening period, a 9-month placebo-controlled treatment phase, a 15-month active therapy extension phase, and a 4-week follow-up period (See Schema). Screening will occur within 35 days prior to Day 1 of the study to confirm that selection criteria for the study are met. At Month 9, the placebo-controlled phase will end, and all participants may enter the active therapy extension phase of the study and receive PF- 06651600. For any participant discontinued for a neurological or auditory adverse event, the participant will be evaluated again at 6 months after discontinuation; the maximum duration of participation in the study for such participants could be approximately 32 months if the event occurred at the last visit. At Month 6, any participant with a baseline overall SALT score 75 will have the option to enter the active therapy extension phase if their overall SALT score at Month 6 has increased from baseline by 25 points. Those participants who enter the active therapy extension phase at Month 6 are to complete at that visit all the Month 6 (Visit 5) assessments and then follow the schedule of visits in the active therapy extension phase starting with Month 3E skipping the Month 9 (Visit 6). Participants who enter the active therapy extension phase at Month 6 will have a skin punch biopsy taken at Month 6 for IENF assessments instead of at Month 9. Participants who discontinue the study due to a neurological or auditory AE will have assessments performed at the time of discontinuation and repeated at 6 months after the last dose of study intervention (see Section 10.7). Scientific Rationale for Study Design Because the dog toxicity study BAEP finding was considered a central auditory effect, BAEP interwave I-V latency will be the primary endpoint for this study, since generally, the interwave latencies are used for diagnosis of brainstem effect in humans. (45) The total duration of the study is approximately 26 months, though this could be longer for any participant who discontinues due to a neurological or auditory AE and needs to return for follow-up in 6 months. This includes a 9-month placebo-controlled phase that will evaluate the effect of PF-06651600 during the same time frame in which axonal dystrophy was observed in the 9-month dog toxicity study (ie, axonal dystrophy in the dog studies presented at 9 months and a functional correlate [BAEP threshold and waveform abnormality] was evident at 7 and 9 months). In this study, BAEP will be measured at screening, 6 months, 9 months (the end of the placebo-controlled phase), Month 9E, and Month 15E or end of treatment for early discontinuation and potentially at a 6-Month Follow-Up. The timepoints for BAEP were chosen for the placebo-controlled phase based on the timing of findings in the dog toxicity study. (46-48) IENFD directly evaluates the loss of axons (as an index of axonal degeneration) and its assessment in peripheral skin punch biopsies is an established technique used in clinical evaluations of patients with peripheral neuropathies. For example, an IENFD study evaluating the structural and functional integrity of small autonomic nerve fibers in E46KSNCA (a biomarker for an aggressive Lewy body brain disease), carriers showed small fiber neurodegeneration in the skin. In another study, distal leg IENFD was study of patients with diabetic small fiber neuropathy, impaired glucose tolerance neuropathy and idiopathic small fiber neuropathy, IENFD loss was seen at three sites (proximal thigh, distal thigh, distal leg) whereas there was no significant change in IENFD in healthy controls over 2 to 3 years. (50) The distal part of lower extremities will be selected for skin punch biopsies because distal portions of long axons are typically more susceptible to axonal dystrophy than proximal portions. Axonal dystrophy and IENFD will be measured at Day 1, Month 9, Month 15E, or end of treatment for early discontinuation and potentially at 6-Month Follow-Up, reflecting the timing of findings in the dog toxicity studies and for longer-term assessment. Inclusion of patients with 25% scalp hair loss due to AA, which the investigator has additionally determined to be appropriate for systemic therapy, is considered to be justified. The threshold of 25% scalp hair loss due to AA is also currently being used in the long-term safety study B7981032. While there is not a generally accepted definition of mild, moderate and severe AA, interviews of dermatologists and patients with an AA history of 50% scalp hair loss indicated that scalp hair loss >20% represents moderate to severe hair loss. Justification for Dose This study will evaluate PF-06651600 administered at a dose of 200 mg QD for 4 weeks followed by a dose of 50 mg QD for up to 24 months. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including the follow-up visit. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study."

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC and SIIV when given together at the same visit ([SIIV+20vPnC]/saline group) compared to 20vPnC given 1 month after SIIV ([SIIV+saline]/20vPnC group). The study design and assessments are modeled from prior studies of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coadministered with influenza vaccine.68,69,70 CCI Approximately 1780 healthy adults 65 years of age will be stratified by prior pneumococcal vaccine status (no previous pneumococcal vaccine [nave], receipt of at least 1 dose of PPSV23 only, receipt of at least 1 dose of 13vPnC only, or receipt of at least 1 dose each of PPSV23 and 13vPnC) and randomized in 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 groups by center-based randomization. The coadministration group ([SIIV+20vPnC]/saline) will receive SIIV and 20vPnC at the same visit (Visit 1), followed 1 month later by administration of saline (Visit 2). The separate-administration group ([SIIV+saline]/20vPnC) will receive SIIV and saline at Visit 1, followed 1 month later with 20vPnC administered at Visit 2. If participants have received prior pneumococcal vaccination(s), the most recent dose must have been given 6 months prior to the first study vaccination. If eligible, participants will have blood drawn for immunogenicity assessments and be randomized to receive either SIIV and 20vPnC ([SIIV+20vPnC]/saline) or SIIV and saline ([SIIV+saline]/20vPnC). Participants will be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination by blinded investigator site staff, and any reactions occurring during that time will be recorded as AEs. At Visit 2, (28 to 42 days after Visit 1 [Study Days 29 to 43]), participants will return to the investigator site and be assessed for continued eligibility. Participants will be asked to provide information on any AEs (including nonserious AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs), and on any needed e-diary follow-up. Participants will also be asked for information on concomitant medications used to treat any SAEs or NDCMCs and on any nonstudy vaccines they received since Visit 1. Participants will receive a vaccination with either saline (if the participant was in the [SIIV+20vPnC]/saline group) or 20vPnC (if the participant was in the [SIIV+saline]/20vPnC group) and be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination by blinded investigator site staff; any reactions occurring during this time will be recorded as AEs. At Visit 1, participants will receive an e-diary (device or mobile-device application), thermometer, and measuring device (caliper) and will be instructed at each vaccination visit (Visit 1 and Visit 2) to record prompted local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) occurring at the 20vPnC/saline injection site within 10 days after vaccination (Days 1 through 10, where Day 1 is the day of vaccination) and prompted systemic events (fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain) occurring within 7 days after vaccination (Days 1 through 7, where Day 1 is the day of vaccination) daily in the e-diary. Participants will also be instructed to record any use of antipyretic/pain medications in the e-diary daily for 7 days after vaccination. Participants will be instructed to contact the study staff if the participant experiences redness or swelling at the 20vPnC/saline injection site measuring >20 measuring device units (>10 cm) or severe injection site pain (prevents daily activity) in the 10 days after vaccination or has an emergency room visit or hospitalization. At Visit 3 (28 to 42 days after Visit 2), participants will return to the investigator site and be assessed for continued eligibility. At Visit 4 (approximately 6 months [168 to 196 days] after Visit 2), the site will contact the participant via telephone to inquire about SAEs and NDCMCs and concomitant medications used to treat SAEs or NDCMCs since the last visit. In the case of extreme circumstances, such as natural disasters or a pandemic, visits for follow-up or procedures may need to be conducted through other means (eg, telephone, home visits). Scientific Rationale for Study Design The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC and SIIV given together at the same visit compared to the vaccines given separately. This study uses a similar design and includes similar assessments as in prior studies of SIIV coadministration with other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (13vPnC and an investigational 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine).68,69,70,85 Additionally, this study design accounts for potential effect of prior pneumococcal vaccine on subsequent pneumococcal responses. Previous studies have found lower pneumococcal responses to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines among individuals vaccinated with PPSV23 compared to nave individuals, and variable responses after a second dose of 13vPnC compared to nave individuals were also observed.68,86 CCI 4.3. Justification for Dose The 20vPnC candidate is modeled after 7vPnC and 13vPnC, and contains capsular polysaccharides from pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F individually conjugated to CRM . The SIIV will be a licensed vaccine, provided in a commercially available presentation, and the indicated dose will be administered.

" where did this study take place? the sponsor ran the study at 2 locations in japan. when did this study take place? it began 21 october 2020 and ended 25 november 2021. who participated in this study? japanese participants 20 to 85 years of age could join the study. study participants:  were examined by the study doctor and determined to be appropriate for study participation  had never been diagnosed with covid-19  had never received a covid-19 vaccine outside of this study  were not allergic to any of the ingredients in the study vaccines  were not pregnant or breast-feeding  a total of 81 men (51%) participated  a total of 79 women (49%) participated  130 participants (81%) were 20 to 64 years of age  30 participants (19%) were 65 to 85 years of age a total of 160participants joined the study, and 157 participants (98%) received both doses of study vaccine or placebo. 3 participants (2%) left the study early: 1 participant left because of a medical problem, 1 participant chose to leave the study, and 1 participant had a protocol deviation (study procedures were not followed correctly). a total of 35 out of 41 (85%) participants who were originally randomized to the placebo group also received both doses of bnt162b2. how long did the study last? participants were in the study for about 1 year. the entire study took a little more than a year to complete. when the study ended in november 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a first report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This is a Phase 1/2, randomized, placebo-controlled, and observer-blind study in healthy Japanese adults. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidate against COVID-19 (BNT162b2), which is the same as the vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/3 evaluation in the C4591001 study:  As 2 doses, separated by 21 days  At a 30-g dose level  In adults 20 to 85 years of age Local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site), systemic events (fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, chills, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or worsened joint pain), and use of antipyretic medication will be prompted for and collected by all participants in an e-diary from Day 1 through Day 7 after each administration of study intervention. AEs will be collected from the time the participant provides informed consent through 1 month after Dose 2, and SAEs will be collected from the time of informed consent through 12 months after Dose 2. One hundred sixty participants will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to study intervention (candidate vaccine: 120, placebo: 40), such that approximately 144 evaluable participants (candidate vaccine: 108, placebo: 36) will be evaluated. As this study is the first study conducted in Japan, clinical laboratory tests will be performed in the first 24 participants (12 participants 20 to 64 years of age and 12 participants 65 to 85 years of age) (clinical laboratory subset). After randomization of all participants in the clinical laboratory subset is completed, the standard participants will be enrolled. Blood will be collected prior to Dose 1, prior to Dose 2, and 7 and 14 days and 1, 6, and 12 months after Dose 2 to assess immunogenicity. The study is observer-blinded, as the physical appearance of the investigational vaccine candidates and the placebo may differ. The participant, investigator, study coordinator, and other site staff will be blinded. At the study site, only the dispenser(s)/administrator(s) are unblinded. To facilitate rapid review of data in real time, sponsor staff will be unblinded to vaccine allocation for the participants. Participants are expected to participate for up to a maximum of approximately 14 months. From protocol amendment 3, this study is transitioned from a clinical trial to a postmarketing study according to the Japanese regulation, because BNT162b2 was approved by the MHLW on 14 February 2021. All participants will be informed of their original study intervention allocation (BNT162b2 or placebo) by the site staff. All participants who originally received placebo will be offered the opportunity to receive BNT162b2 at their earliest convenience as part of the study (administration of BNT162b2 before the 6-month follow-up visit [Visit 8 for the clinical laboratory subset or Visit 6 for the standard participants] is allowed). If they want to receive BNT162b2, they will move to the SoA in Section 1.3.3 for their remaining visits. Participants who originally received BNT162b2 and placebo recipients who decline BNT162b2 vaccination will continue in the study as originally planned. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design Additional surveillance for COVID-19 will be conducted as part of the study, given the potential risk of disease enhancement. If a participant experiences symptoms, as detailed in Section 8.13, a COVID-19 illness and subsequent convalescent visit will occur. As part of these visits, local test results of COVID-19 and local diagnosis of COVID-19 as available will be confirmed. Human reproductive safety data are not available for BNT162 RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, but there is no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on the intended mechanism of action of the compound. Therefore, the use of a highly effective method of contraception is required (see Appendix 4). 4.3. Justification for Dose The 2 vaccine candidates (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) at several dose levels were studied in Phase 1 evaluation in the C4591001 study based on the preliminary experience in the C4591001 study and the BioNTech study (BNT162-01) conducted in Germany. The vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/3 evaluation in the C4591001 study is BNT162b2 at a dose of 30 g. End of Study Definition The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study."
" how was the study done? researchers tested different doses of danuglipron on a group of adult participants with t2dm being treated with metformin and a group of adult participants with obesity but without t2dm to compare the number of participants in both groups who had medical problems and the severity of these medical problems. participants with t2dm were put into 1 of 6 treatment groups by chance alone, like the flip of a coin. this is known as a randomized study. randomization is done to make the groups more similar for characteristics like age and sex. in 5 groups the t2dm participants received danuglipron and in 1 group participants received the placebo. participants with obesity (without t2dm) were put into 1 of 2 treatment groups also by chance. in 1 group the obesity participants received danuglipron and in the other group participants received the placebo. participants in all 6 groups that received danuglipron were given the study medicine at a low starting dose (5 mg of danuglipron) or high starting dose (10 mg of danuglipron) and the dose was increased every 1 or 2 weeks to reach different target doses (80 mg, 120 mg, or 200 mg of danuglipron), depending on which group they were put into. for example, participants in group 1 were given a low starting dose of danuglipron (5 mg), which doubled every week to reach the target dose of 120 mg; these are fast titration steps. a shortened format for this is danuglipron x mg y, z where x is the target dose, y is the low or high starting dose, and z is the fast or slow titration steps. the steps involving dose increases with the corresponding groups are shown in more detail in the image below. after the screening period, all participants took placebo for around 2 weeks. participants then began taking danuglipron or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks based on which treatment group they were randomized into. this part of the study was double-blinded. this means the participants and study doctors did not know who was given which treatment during this part of the study. researchers use double-blinded studies to make sure that the results of the study were not influenced in any way. finally, participants completed a follow-up visit which lasted 4 weeks after taking their last dose of danuglipron or placebo. the study design is shown in the image below. the 6 danuglipron dose groups and placebo group are detailed below; all doses were administered twice daily over 12 weeks:  group 1 (t2dm): starting dose of 5 mg of danuglipron with dose increased weekly to 120 mg of danuglipron (120 mg low, fast).  group 2 (t2dm): starting dose of 10 mg of danuglipron with dose increased weekly to 120 mg of danuglipron (120 mg high, fast).  group 3 (t2dm): starting dose of 5 mg of danuglipron with dose increased every 2 weeks to 80 mg of danuglipron (80 mg low, slow).  group 4 (t2dm): starting dose of 10 mg of danuglipron with dose increased every 2 weeks to 80 mg of danuglipron (80 mg high, slow).  group 5: placebo (t2dm) and placebo (obesity without t2dm)  group 6 (t2dm): starting dose of 10 mg with dose increased weekly to 200 mg of danuglipron (200 mg high, fast).  group 7 (obesity without t2dm): starting dose of 10 mg with dose increased weekly to 200 mg of danuglipron (200 mg high, fast). where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 38 locations in the united states. when did this study take place? it began 6 january 2021 and ended 17 november 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who had t2dm who were being treated with metformin and participants with obesity but without t2dm.  a total of 73 men participated  a total of 78 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 21 to 75 participants were to be treated until the end of the 12-week treatment period. there were a total 151 participants who were treated with danuglipron or placebo, of which 123 participants had t2dm and 28 participants had obesity (without t2dm). in the t2dm group: a total of 45 participants (37%) did not finish the double-blind treatment period. the most common reason for not finishing the treatment period was because of medical problems (32 participants [26%]). of the 29 participants (24%) who did not finish the follow-up period, the most common reason was because of medical problems (14 participants [11%]). in the obesity (without t2dm) group: a total of 17 participants (61%) did not finish the double-blind treatment period. the most common reason for not finishing the treatment period was because of medical problems (12 participants [43%]). of the 9 participants (32%) who did not finish the follow-up period, the most common reasons were because of medical problems, the participants left by choice and the participants were lost to follow-up (3 participants each [11%]). how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for 22 weeks. the entire study took just over 10 months to complete. when the study ended in november 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Overall Design This Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sponsor-open, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, study will assess tolerability, safety, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BID administration of PF-06882961 in adult participants with T2DM who are treated with metformin. In addition, participants with obesity, without T2DM, will be enrolled to explore differences in tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between participants with T2DM and participants without T2DM and to support clinical development in both T2DM and obesity. For participants with T2DM, the metformin dose (at least 500 mg/day) must have been stable for at least 60 days prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) and should remain the same until the first follow-up visit (ie, Visit 10, Week 13-14), except in circumstances where a dose change is deemed medically necessary. Following the screening period to confirm eligibility (up to 4 weeks), the study will consist of a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, prior to randomization on Day 1. PF-06882961 doses will be titrated to a target dose of 80 mg BID in 2 arms, 120 mg BID in 2 arms, and 200 mg BID in 1 arm. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study is designed to assess the tolerability, safety, and PD of PF-06882961 in participants with T2DM and in non-diabetic participants with obesity over 12 weeks of dosing. A single-blind placebo-run-in period (Visit 2 to Visit 3) is included in this study to familiarize participants with the study treatment regimens and to exclude those who are not compliant with blinded placebo dosing prior to randomization. This study will assess tolerability of PF-06882961 at different starting doses (5 mg BID vs 10 mg BID), as well as tolerability of PF-06882961 at different duration of each titration step (1 week vs. 2 weeks), and the tolerability of different target doses (80 mg BID, 120 mg BID and 200 mg BID). CCI safety and PK exposures directly in this study, the study population includes participants with obesity without T2DM, to target a similar BMI range as patients with T2DM and to support clinical development in T2DM and obesity. Assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior by the C-SSRS19 and PHQ-920 will also be performed based on the potential risk related to the product labeling for the injectable GLP1R agonist liraglutide for obesity.21 While GLP-1R agonists typically are not associated with hypoglycemia unless co-administered with anti-diabetic agents that can cause hypoglycemia (such as insulin or sulfonylureas), blood glucose concentrations will be monitored throughout the study via glucometer, and monitoring of symptomatic hypoglycemic AEs (HAEs) will be performed. However, as marketed GLP-1R agonists are listed as contraindicated in pregnancy, the use of a highly effective method of contraception is required and measures will be taken to limit the risk of pregnancy in the female population enrolled (see Schedule of Activities and Appendix 4 re: contraception) for additional information regarding contraception use and monitoring. The potential risk of exposure to PF-06882961 in a sexual partner of a male participant in this study via ejaculate is low, and therefore no contraception (condom) use in male participants is warranted. The safety margin of 100-fold is based on applying a 10-fold safety factor for interspecies extrapolation and a 10-fold safety factor for susceptible populations.11 Banked biospecimens will be collected for exploratory pharmacogenomic/genomic/ biomarker analyses and retained in the Biospecimen Banking System (BBS), which makes it possible to better understand the investigational products mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, tolerability, safety, and/or efficacy not anticipated prior to the beginning of the study. Justification for Dose The target doses (planned dose at end of study) in the C3421008 study of 80 mg BID (Arms 3 and 4)and 120 mg BID (Arms 1 and 2) represent the 2 top doses being assessed in the Phase 2b dose ranging study in T2DM with PF-06882961. The starting dose and titration scheme for Arms 6 and 7 is similar to Arm 2 (Figure 1), but the titration scheme continues at a 1-week interval over a longer duration to achieve a higher target dose. Although the steady-state exposures of PF-06882961 at 200 mg BID in T2DM participants are expected to be higher than that encountered in previous clinical studies (120 mg BID in C3421002), reasonable tolerability of this dose may be expected based on the extended 12-week titration scheme. Moreover, the predicted exposure at 200 mg BID in participants with obesity and without T2DM is expected to have a 27- and 14-fold margin under the unbound NOAEL for the 6 month rat toxicology study for C and AUC, respectively max (Section 2.2.2.2). In the current study, the doses will be titrated to the highest doses over a 10-week duration, which is expected to improve the tolerability of PF-06882961, and therefore doses of up to 200 mg BID are viewed as appropriate for assessment in this study. While this study is designed with target doses of 80 mg BID, intermediate doses of 10 to 60 mg will also be assessed in this study, with tolerability of titration schemes leading to these intermediate doses. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study, including the follow-up visit (Visit 11), approximately 28 to 35 days post last dose of double-blind investigator product (IP). The end of the study is defined as the date of the follow-up last visit (Visit 11) of the last participant in the study."
" how was the study done? researchers tested pf-07038124 ointment on a group of study participants to find out if study participants treated with this ointment had fewer symptoms of atopic dermatitis or plaque psoriasis than participants who used a plain ointment. participants went to the study center to be screened by the study doctor to make sure they were able to join the study and to see if they had mild to moderate atopic dermatitis or plaque psoriasis. this was known as the screening period and this lasted up to 6 weeks. participants then entered the treatment period, which started on day 1 and lasted 6 weeks. during the treatment period, participants were to apply the ointment once a day to an area or areas of skin affected by their atopic dermatitis or plaque psoriasis. the study participants and researchers did not know who used pf-07038124 ointment and who used the plain ointment. this is known as a blinded study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. each participant visited the study center on day 1, and then on week 1, week 2, week 4, and week 6. during these visits, the study doctors assessed the participants atopic dermatitis or plaque psoriasis and general health. participants were also asked to provide blood and urine samples for testing. participants were not treated after week 6 but were to remain in the study for the next 4 to 5 weeks for safety monitoring and questioning about their health. participants then returned to the study center for the final study assessments. the following figure shows what happened during this study: note: notall participants were available to attend the follow-up visit. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 34 locations in 4 countries in north america, australia, and europe. when did this study take place? it began 21 december 2020 and ended 18 august 2021. who participated in this study? the study included adult participants who had mild or moderate atopic dermatitis or mild or moderate plaque psoriasis.  a total of 49 men participated  a total of 55 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 19 and 70 years participants were to be treated for 6 weeks. of the 152 participants who were screened, 104 participants (70 [67%] with atopic dermatitis and 34 [33%] with plaque psoriasis) started the study, 88 participants (60 [58%] with atopic dermatitis and 28 [27%] with plaque psoriasis) completed treatment, and 91 participants (61 [59%] with atopic dermatitis and 30 [29%] with plaque psoriasis) finished the safety follow up phase of the study. there were 16 participants (10 [10%] with atopic dermatitis and 6 [6%] with plaque psoriasis) who did not finish treatment, and 7 participants (5 [5%] with atopic dermatitis and 2 [2%] with plaque psoriasis) who did not finish the safety follow up part of the study. most participants stopped study treatment because of medical problems or because they no longer wanted to continue in the study. how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for 16 to 17 weeks. the entire study took just over 34 weeks to complete. when the study ended in august 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 4. STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This is a phase 2a, randomized, double blind, vehicle controlled, parallel group, multicenter study on the efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK of PF-07038124 0.01% QD versus vehicle control in the treatment of adult participants with mild to moderate AD or mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. In this study the efficacy of PF-07038124 ointment versus vehicle will be assessed in two different indications  there is a separate vehicle control group for each indication. A total of approximately 88 participants with AD or psoriasis will be randomly assigned to study intervention in this basket trial design. For AD, a maximum of approximately 56 participants will be randomly assigned to study intervention such that approximately 42 evaluable participants complete the study. Assuming a 25% drop out rate, approximately 28 participants will be randomized to either PF-07038124 or vehicle control to achieve approximately 21 completers in each group. Randomization will be stratified by baseline disease severity (mild [Investigators Global Assessment or IGA = 2] vs. moderate [IGA = 3]). Up to 25% of AD participants will have an IGA score of 2 at baseline. For psoriasis, a maximum of approximately 32 participants will be randomly assigned to study intervention such that approximately 24 evaluable participants complete the study. Assuming a 25% drop out rate, approximately 16 participants will be randomized to PF-07038124 or vehicle control to achieve 12 completers in each group. Randomization will be stratified by baseline disease severity (mild [Physician Global Assessment or PGA = 2] vs. moderate [PGA = 3]). Up to 25% of participants will have a PGA score of 2 at baseline. The total duration of study participation will be approximately 17 weeks, including a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of 6 weeks, and a safety follow-up period of 4-5 weeks from last dose of study drug to last study visit. The study intervention arms and duration for AD and psoriasis participants are the same (See Section 1.1 for detailed Study Intervention Groups and Section 1.2 for Study Schema). 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This 6-week study is the first time a topical PF-07038124 ointment is being evaluated in the AD and psoriasis populations. Previous Pfizer trials in these indications indicate that a 6-week duration is appropriate to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability. The current nonclinical toxicology package supports the study durations of up to 12 weeks. For AD the primary endpoint is percent change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI); secondary endpoints include Investigators Global Assessment (IGA). For psoriasis the primary endpoint is percent change from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI); the secondary endpoints include Physician Global Assessment (PGA). Human reproductive safety data are limited for PF-07038124, but there is no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on the intended pharmacology of the compound. In addition, EFD studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures that correspond to 1.7x and 2.7x the maximum planned clinical exposure did not cause any effects on embryo-fetal development. See Appendix 4 for contraceptive requirements. CCI 4.2.1. Participant Input into Design Not applicable. 4.3. Justification for Dose The nonclinical safety profile of PF-07038124 following systemic administration to rats and topical application to minipigs supports human clinical studies of up to 3 months in duration (See Section 2.2). The dose proposed for this study was determined considering all relevant information obtained from nonclinical safety studies, incorporating the NOAEL from 3-month studies in minipigs, together with the systemic exposure observed following topical application of PF-07038124 to healthy participants. As a result, the dose strength of PF-07038124 selected for this study is 0.01%, applied once daily. CCI  4.4. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study, including the last visit shown in the SoA. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study in the trial globally."
" how was the study done? part 1 in the first part of the study, researchers studied 5 groups of study participants. each group received 2 doses of the bnt162b2 vaccine, given about 3 weeks apart:  group 1 (351 participants): us lot 1, standard dose  group 2 (352 participants): us lot 2, standard dose  group 3 (347 participants): us lot 3, standard dose  group 4 (173 participants): eu lot, standard dose  group 5: (351 participants): us lot 1, low dose participants were first screened by a doctor to make sure they met the requirements to join the study. this was known as the screening period. participants were in part 1 for about 2 months, and were expected to attend 3 visits at the study center during this time. at these visits, participants received study vaccines, had their blood drawn and other lab samples collected, and were monitored for any medical problems. the figure below shows what happened during part 1. part 2 (booster study) in the booster study, researchers studied 2 groups of study participants who had previously received 2 standard doses of bnt162b2 (us lot) during the first part of the study. each group received 1 booster dose of either bnt162b2 or bnt162b2 beta, given about 3 months after they received the second dose in the first part of the study. bnt162b2 beta is a slightly modified version of bnt162b2, made to help provide protection against a variant of covid-19 from south africa.  booster group 1 (31 participants): bnt162b2  booster group 2 (31 participants): bnt162b2 beta participants were in the booster study for about 1 month, and were expected to attend 3 visits at the study center during this time. at these visits, participants received study vaccines, had their blood drawn and other lab samples collected, and were monitored for any medical problems. the figure below shows what happened during the booster study. this was as an observer blinded study, which means that the researchers and the participants did not know which lot or dose they received, but the healthcare workers who prepared and administered the study vaccines did know. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran the first part of the study at 16 locations in the united states, and the booster study at 8 of these 16 locations. when did this study take place? it began 15 february 2021 and ended 22 july 2021. who participated in this study? participants 12 to 50 years of age could join part 1, and participants 18 to 50 years of age who had completed part 1 could join the booster study. study participants:  were examined by the study doctor and determined to be appropriate for study participation  had never been diagnosed with covid-19  had never received a covid-19 vaccine outside of this study  were not allergic to any of the ingredients in the study vaccines  were not pregnant or breast-feeding  a total of 815 men (52%) participated in part 1  a total of 758 women (48%) participated in part 1  all participants in part 1 were 12 to 50 years of age  a total of 31 men (50%) participated in the booster study  a total of 31 women (50%) participated in the booster study  all participants in the booster study were 19 to 50 years of age a total of 1574participants joined part 1, and 1573 participants (more than 99%) received at least 1 study vaccine. 1570 participants (more than 99%) received both doses. 16 participants (1%) left the study early, and 2 participants (less than 1%) did not receive the second dose due to a medical problem or pregnancy, but remained in the study. 1557 participants (99%) completed the study. a total of 62participants joined the booster study and received the booster vaccine. all 62 participants (100%) completed the booster study. how long did the study last? study participants were in part 1 for about 2 months and the booster study for an additional 1 month. the entire study took about 5 months to complete. when the study ended in july 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. what were the results of part 1 of the study? did participants who received vaccines from the 3 us lots have similar immune responses? the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in participants blood 1 month after the second dose of bnt162b2. the researchers found that antibody levels in participants from groups 1, 2, and 3 (standard-dose bnt162b2 us lots 1, 2, and 3) were within a range considered to be comparable to each other. therefore, the participants who received vaccines from the 3 us lots had similar immune responses. based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of chance. did participants who received a low-dose vaccine have similar immune responses to participants who received a standard-dose vaccine from the same lot? the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in participants blood 1 month after the second dose of bnt162b2. the researchers found that antibody levels in participants from group 1 (us lot 1, standard dose) and group 5 (us lot 1, low dose) were within a range considered to be comparable to each other. therefore, the participants who received a low-dose vaccine had similar immune responses to participants who received a standard-dose vaccine from the same lot. based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of chance. did participants who received vaccines from the eu lot have similar immune responses to participants who received vaccines from the us lots? the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in participants blood 1 month after the second dose of bnt162b2. the researchers found that antibody levels in participants from groups 1, 2, and 3 combined (us lots 1, 2, and 3, standard dose) and group 4 (eu lot, standard dose) were within a range considered to be comparable to each other. therefore, the participants who received vaccines from the eu lot had similar immune responses to participants who received vaccines from the us lots. based on these results, the researchers have decided that the results are not likely the result of chance. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. this is a summary of just some of the main results of this study. other studies may have different results. what were the results of the booster study? did participants have an immune response to the booster dose? the researchers measured the amount of antibodies against the virus that can cause covid-19 in participants blood 1 month after the booster dose of bnt162b2 or bnt162b2 beta. these participants had previously received 2 standard doses of bnt162b2 (us lot) during the first part of the study. researchers saw a rise in antibodies among the participants who received either booster dose (bnt162b2 or bnt162b2 beta). this indicates that the participants did have an immune response to the booster dose. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. this is a summary of just some of the main results of this study. other studies may have different results. what medical problems did participants have during part 1 of the study? the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance) or medical problems could also have been caused by a study vaccine or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many vaccine groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what effects a study vaccine might have on a participant. how many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site within 7 days after vaccination? a total of 1412 out of 1573 participants (90%) had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days after receiving either dose of bnt162b2. these were mostly mild to moderate, and were already known to be side effects of bnt162b2. the percentage of participants with redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site was similar across each vaccine group, and similar after dose 1 and dose 2. pain at the injection site was the most common of these medical problems. how many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after vaccination? a total of 1397 out of 1573 participants (89%) had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after receiving either dose of bnt162b2. these were mostly mild to moderate, and were already known to be side effects of bnt162b2. the percentage of participants with these medical problems was similar across each vaccine group, and these medical problems were more common after dose 2 than dose 1. tiredness, headache, and muscle pain were the most common of these medical problems. how many participants had any medical problems within 1 month after vaccination? a total of 100 out of 1573 participants (6%) had at least 1 medical problem. skin rash and swollen lymph nodes were the most common medical problem, occurring in 7 out of 1573 participants (less than 1%) each. no medical problem happened in at least 1% of participants. one participant (less than 1%) from group 5 left the study because of medical problems that were considered to be related to bnt162b2 (skin inflammation and swelling under the skin), and 1 participant (less than 1%) from group 3 left the study due to pregnancy. what medical problems did participants have during the booster study? how many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site within 7 days after the booster dose? a total of 57 out of 62 participants (92%) had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days after receiving the booster. these were mostly mild to moderate, and were already known to be side effects of bnt162b2 and bnt162b2 beta. the percentage of participants with pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site was similar in both booster vaccine groups. pain at the injection site was the most common of these medical problems, and occurred more frequently after the booster dose than after dose 2. how many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after the booster dose? a total of 54 out of 62 participants (87%) had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after receiving the booster. these were mostly mild to moderate, and were already known to be side effects of bnt162b2 and bnt162b2 beta. the percentage of participants with these medical problems was similar in both vaccine groups. these medical problems occurred at a similar rate after dose 2 and the booster dose. tiredness, headache, and muscle pain were the most common of these medical problems. how many participants had any medical problems within 1 month after the booster dose? a total of 3 out of 62 participants (5%) had at least 1 medical problem within 1 month after the booster dose. these medical problems included neck pain, abnormal growth of cells in the abdomen, and swollen lymph nodes. swollen lymph nodes was considered to be related to the booster. no participants left the booster study because of medical problems. did study participants have any serious medical problems? a medical problem is considered serious when it is life-threatening, needs hospital care, or causes lasting problems. how many participants had serious medical problems within 1 month after vaccination? during the first part of the study, 2 out of 1573 participants (less than 1%) had a serious medical problem within 1 month after vaccination: 1 participant from group 4 had a long-lasting migraine headache, and 1 participant from group 3 received bnt162b2 while pregnant and had a miscarriage 30 days later. the study doctor did not consider these medical problems to be related to bnt162b2. how many participants had serious medical problems within 1 month after the booster dose? no participants had serious medical problems during the booster study. no participants died during the first part of the study or the booster study. where can i learn more about this study? if you have questions about the results of your study, please speak with the doctor or staff at your study site. for more details on your study protocol, please visit: www.clinicaltrials.gov use the study identifier nct04713553 please remember that researchers look at the results of many studies to find out which vaccines can work and are safe for study participants. again, if you participated in this study, thank you for volunteering. we do research to try to find the best ways to help study participants, and you helped us to do that!"," 4. STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design Primary Study This is a Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 4 manufacturing lots of BNT162b2 as a 30-g dose and an additional 20-g dose arm using one of the same manufactured 30-g lots. BNT162b2 is an RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, administered on a 2-dose schedule in healthy participants 12 through 50 years of age. The study will be conducted in the United States. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 5 arms in a 2:2:2:1:2 ratio (Arm 1: Arm 2: Arm 3: Arm 4: Arm 5), where Arms 1, 2, and 3 contain US-manufactured drug substance for 30-g dosing; Arm 4 contains EU-manufactured drug substance for 30-g dosing; and Arm 5 contains US-manufactured drug substance for 20-g dosing. In order to allow for balanced age representation across all arms, the randomization will be stratified by age groups: 12 through 17, 18 through 30, and 31 through 50 years. The duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 2 months. This study is observer-blinded, as the volumes of the 20-g and the 30-g doses of investigational vaccine are different. Approximately 340 participants will be randomly assigned to each of the 3 US lots (Arms 1-3) and to the 20-g arm (Arm 5) and approximately 170 participants will be randomly assigned to the EU lot (Arm 4), for a total of approximately 1530 randomized participants. It is expected that approximately 1224 evaluable participants will complete the study, based on a 20% nonevaluable rate. Booster Study Protocol amendment 2 has added a booster study in which a subset of the adult participants (18 through 50 years of age) who each received two 30-g doses of the designated US lot(s) will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 arms in a 1:1 ratio (Booster 1: Booster 2), where Booster 1 is BNT162b2 at 30 g and Booster 2 is BNT162b2.B.1.351 at 30 g. The third dose will be administered approximately 3 months after BNT162b2 Dose 2 of the primary study. Approximately 30 participants will be assigned to each arm for a total of 60 participants enrolled. It is expected that approximately 48 evaluable participants will complete the study, based on a 20% nonevaluable rate. The duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 1 month. This study is observer-blinded, to minimize changes in study conduct compared with the primary study. This facilitates the start of a booster study with the third dose to be given 3 months after the receipt of Dose 2. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study contains assessments that could be considered standard for a vaccine study. Blood samples taken for immunogenicity will establish the level of immune response elicited by each arm to provide the necessary data to meet the primary endpoints of the study. Immunogenicity will be assessed by the full-length S-binding IgG assay and 2 SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays, one with the reference strain and the second with the B.1.351 strain. To establish if a participant has asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing (ie, NAAT) and blood samples to measure N-binding antibody levels will be taken. A positive result on either test will result in the immunogenicity data from that participant being excluded from the evaluable portion of the study population. All reactogenicity and safety assessments are standard for a study of this nature. This study will not include a placebo, as the aim and design of this study is not to demonstrate efficacy. Human reproductive safety data are not available for BNT162b2, but there is no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on the intended mechanism of action of the compound. Therefore, the use of a highly effective method of contraception is required (see Appendix 4). 4.3. Justification for Dose Based on data from the Phase 1 component of clinical trial C4591001, after administration of Dose 1 and prior to administration of Dose 2, BNT162b2 showed modest increases in SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing GMTs over baseline across dose levels (10 g, 20 g, and 30 g) in both younger and older groups. Overall, BNT162b2 elicited higher antigen-binding and neutralizing responses in younger participants than in older participants. The boost effect after receiving Dose 2 was most pronounced at the 30-g dose level for older participants, hence its selection as the dose for Phase 2/3 evaluation.11 These data also support investigating the lower dose of 20 g in this younger study population, as the measured immune responses in both the 20-g and 30-g cohorts were similar with regard to the younger age group. As this 30-g dose was approved in multiple countries for EUA, the additional booster dose will be administered at the same dose. 4.4. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases (as applicable) of the respective study (primary, booster) into which he/she is enrolled, including the last visit. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the booster study."
" how was the study done? researchers tested 3 versions of bnt162b2 in this study. the study had 2 parts, which ran separately. each participant joined 1 part of this study and received 1 version of bnt162b2. bnt162b2 (30 micrograms or mcg) was given in 2 doses at 3 weeks apart. in both parts, the healthcare workers who injected the vaccine knew which version of bnt162b2 the participants got. the researchers and participants did not know. this is called an observer-blinded study. being blinded allows researchers to study each version of bnt162b2 fairly. part 1: participants who joined part 1 were assigned to receive either freeze-dried or frozen-liquid bnt162b2 by chance. figure 1 below shows what happened during part 1. figure 1: what happened during part 1? researchers compared the results of participants who got freeze-dried bnt162b2 with the results of participants who got frozen-liquid bnt162b2. part 2: participants who joined part 2 were assigned to receive either frozen-liquid or rtu bnt162b2 by chance. the difference between the 2 frozen-liquid versions in part 1 versus part 2 is the size of the carrier part of the vaccine. this carrier delivers the rna that helps the body to make spike proteins. these spike proteins may help the body to produce antibodies to fight against covid-19. figure 2 below shows what happened during part 2. figure 2: what happened during part 2? researchers compared the results of participants who got frozen-liquid bnt162b2 with the results of participants who got rtu bnt162b2. parts 1 and 2: on visits 1 and 3, the following samples were taken from participants:  blood samples to test for antibodies against the virus that causes covid-19.  nasal swab samples to test for presence of the virus that causes covid-19. throughout the study, participants were asked how they were feeling and if they received other types of vaccines. where did this study take place? this study was run at 20 locations in the united states. when did this study take place? it began 01 april 2021 and ended 01 december 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who:  were assessed as healthy by the study doctors.  were between 18 and 55 years old at visit 1 of the study.  did not have prior covid-19.  had not gotten any vaccine for covid-19 before this study.  had not taken any medicines that prevent covid-19. part 1: overall, 559 participants took part: 290 men and 269 women. they were between 18 and 55 years old.  a total of 549 out of 559 participants (98%) finished part 1.  a total of 10 out of 559 participants (2%) did not finish part 1. figure 1 above shows the number of participants in part 1. part 2: overall, 70 participants took part: 32 men and 38 women. they were between 18 and 55 years old.  a total of 67 out of 70 participants (96%) finished part 2.  a total of 3 out of 70 participants (4%) did not finish part 2. figure 2 above shows the number of participants in part 2. across the 2 parts, the most common reason for not finishing the study was because participants could not be reached for follow-up. how long did the study last? each participant was in part 1 or 2 for about 2 months. the entire study took about 8 months to complete. when the study ended in december 2021, the sponsor agent began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor agent then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 4. STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This is a Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of multiple formulations of BNT162b2, an RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, administered on a 2-dose schedule in healthy adults 18 through 55 years of age. The study will be conducted in the US with potential to expand to other countries. In Part 1, participants will receive either lyophilized BNT162b2 in SDVs or frozen-liquid BNT162b2 in MDVs. In Part 2, participants will receive either frozen-liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification or RTU BNT162b2. In Part 1, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 groups (lyophilized SDV or frozen-liquid MDV control for lyophilized SDV). Separately, in Part 2, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 groups (frozen-liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification or RTU BNT162b2). The duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 2 months. Approximately 550 participants will be randomly assigned to either lyophilized SDV or frozen-liquid MDV control for lyophilized SDV; separately, approximately 60 participants will be randomly assigned to receive either frozen-liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification or RTU BNT162b2, for a total of approximately 610 randomized participants. It is expected that approximately 488 evaluable participants will complete the study, based on a 20% nonevaluable rate. Updates as part of protocol amendment 2: All participants who originally received 2 doses of the lyophilized formulation of BNT162b2 will be offered the opportunity to receive a third dose with the current frozen-liquid formulation of BNT162b2. Those participants who accept the offer of receiving third dose will have 2 additional visits as described in Section 1.3.1. The study duration will be extended for 1 additional month for those participants who accept the offer of receiving a third dose. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study contains assessments that could be considered standard for a vaccine noninferiority study. Blood samples taken for immunogenicity will establish the level of immune response elicited by each formulation to provide the necessary data to meet the primary endpoint of the study. Immunogenicity will be assessed by the full-length S-binding IgG assay. To establish if a participant has asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing (ie, NAAT) and blood samples to measure N-binding antibody levels will be taken. A positive result on either test will result in the immunogenicity data from that participant being excluded from the evaluable portion of the study population. All reactogenicity and safety assessments are standard for a study of this nature. This study will not include a placebo, as the aim and design of this study are not to demonstrate efficacy. Human reproductive safety data are not available for BNT162b2, but there is no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on the intended mechanism of action of the compound. Therefore, the use of a highly effective method of contraception is required (see Appendix 4). 4.3. Justification for Dose Based on data from the Phase 1 component of clinical trial C4591001 and available nonclinical data, the modRNA BNT162b2 vaccine candidate was selected at a dose of 30 g for Phase 2/3 evaluation of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. This is the dose that has shown to be effective and has been authorized for temporary or emergency use. Update based on protocol amendment 2: The primary immunogenicity analysis demonstrated that the immune response elicited by the lyophilized formulation did not meet the noninferiority criteria compared to the frozen-liquid formulation. Therefore, all study participants who received 2 doses of the lyophilized formulation will be offered an additional 30-ug dose of the frozen-liquid formulation. 4.4. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study, including the last visit. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study."
" how was the study done? researchers tested nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on a group of study participants. researchers wanted to find out how many participants taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were hospitalized due to covid-19. they also recorded how many participants passed away due to any cause. researchers compared the results of study participants taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to the results of study participants taking a placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks like nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. the study participants and researchers did not know who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. study participants were assigned to take nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or placebo by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study, and it helps make the treatment groups similar and more even to compare. the study included participants who were at a higher risk of getting severe covid-19, such as people who were older or had diabetes. as shown in the figure, there were a total of 2246 participants who entered the study. of these participants, 1120 participants were given nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and 1126 participants were given placebo: figure 1. overall study design the researchers looked at 2 groups of participants who started treatment within 3 days or 5 days of their covid-19 symptoms starting:  group 1 started treatment within 3 days of their covid-19 symptoms starting. this group included 697 participants who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 682 participants who took the placebo. they took this medication twice a day for 5 days.  group 2 started treatment within 5 days of their covid-19 symptoms starting. this group included 1039 participants who took nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and 1046 participants who took the placebo. they also took this medication twice a day for 5 days. participants then had follow-up visits up to 24 weeks after starting treatment. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 343 locations in 21 countries around the world. when did this study take place? it began 16 july 2021 and ended 26 april 2022. who participated in this study? the study included participants who tested positive for covid-19 and were showing symptoms. they werent in the hospital yet but were at a higher risk of progressing to more severe illness that could result in hospitalization.  a total of 1148 men participated  a total of 1098 women participated  all participants were between the ages of 18 and 88 years. of the 2246 participants who started the study:  2084 participants completed the study.  162 participants left before the study was over. the most common reason for leaving the study was because the participant left the study by their choice. how long did the study last? study participants were treated for 5 days and were followed in the study for up to 24 weeks. the entire study took about 9 months to complete. when the study ended in april 2022, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Overall Design This Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in approximately 3000 symptomatic participants with COVID-19 who are nonhospitalized will determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of PF-07321332/ritonavir compared with placebo. Eligible participants with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be randomized (1:1) to receive PF-07321332 and ritonavir or placebo orally q12h for 5 days (10 doses total). Randomization will be stratified by geographic region and by whether participants have received/are expected to receive treatment with COVID-19 therapeutic mAbs based on the site investigators assessment at time of randomization. Throughout the study period, provision will be made to allow study visits to be conducted at a participants home or at another nonclinic location approved by the investigator where possible when participants are unwilling or unable to attend a clinic visit. Enrollment of participants who have received/are expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment is expected to be approximately 20% and will be limited to approximately 25% of participants. Enrollment of participants that had COVID-19 symptom onset >3 days prior to randomization is expected to be approximately 25% and will be limited to a total of approximately 1000 participants. The total study duration is up to 24 weeks and includes a screening period of no more than 48 hours, study intervention through Day 5 or Day 6, efficacy assessments through Day 28, a safety follow-up period through Day 34, and long-term follow up at Weeks 12 and 24. An independent E-DMC will review unblinded data to ensure the safety of participants on an ongoing basis throughout the duration of the study, as specified in the E-DMC Charter. In addition to up to weekly reviews of safety, the E-DMC will review the following:  Sentinel cohort safety review: The E-DMC will review unblinded safety data after approximately the first 60 participants have completed Day 10 of the study, at which point enrollment will be paused pending E-DMC review of the safety data.  Interim analysis: A planned interim analysis for efficacy and futility with a sample size re-estimation will be done after approximately 45% of participants in the mITT analysis set complete the Day 28 assessments (ie, 28 days after randomization). Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study evaluates safety and the potential effect of an investigational agent on reducing COVID-19 related hospitalizations and death (all cause), and, as a secondary endpoint, the duration and severity of COVID-19-associated symptoms because participants are symptomatic upon entry to this study. Previous studies with mAbs directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein that have received an EUA from the US FDA showed efficacy in reducing hospitalizations and/or death in high-risk participants, as well as reducing SARS CoV-2 shedding on NP swabs and time to symptom resolution.3,25,26 Efficacy assessments (including participant reported COVID-19 symptoms and severity, COVID-19-related medical visits, and vital status) will be collected through Day 28. The symptom endpoint includes those recommended by FDA and relies on targeted symptoms that have been associated with COVID-19, and which are expected to be dynamic and improve with effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy. This study uses a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, which is a well- accepted approach for evaluating efficacy in a clinical research setting. Because the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines panel29 recommends use of the available EUA mAb therapies for the progression, participants enrolled in the US (and other countries, depending on availability), may receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb as SoC treatment. Because of limited in-human dosing before this Phase 2/3 study, an early safety analysis (with enrollment pause) will be conducted by the E-DMC following enrollment of a sentinel cohort of 60 participants. Diversity of Study Population Reasonable attempts will be made to enroll participants to ensure the study population is representative of the patient population that will be treated with PF-07321332/ritonavir in clinical practice. Dose selection for this study included consideration of all relevant available preclinical and clinical data, including repeat-dose toxicology studies, clinical safety, and PK data from the Phase 1 study (C4671001), and in vitro pharmacology studies with PF-07321332. Following the first dose of 300 mg of PF-07321332 coadministered with 100 mg ritonavir q12h, median C of unbound (free) PF-07321332 are predicted to be approximately trough 289 ng/mL (equivalent to 933 ng/mL total), ie, approximately 3-fold higher than the in vitro EC of 90.4 ng/mL determined in dNHBE cells (equivalent to 181 nM, f , human=0.310). At 90 u this dose, for a hypothetical intersubject variability of 60%, more than 95% of the participants are predicted to maintain free PF-07321332 concentrations above the in vitro EC over the 12-hour dosing interval. 90 The selected duration is based on the effectiveness demonstrated following 5-day administration of other antiviral agents used in the treatment of acute respiratory infections, such as remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2 and oseltamivir for influenza. Preliminary safety data from study C4671001, collected up to 07 April 2021 and 14 April 2021, showed an acceptable safety profile for single doses of PF-07321332 ranging from 150 mg to 1500 mg dosed alone and of 250 mg and 750 mg dosed with ritonavir (100 mg administered at -12h, 0h, 12h) and for 10-day repeated doses ranging from 75 mg BID to 500 mg BID with 100 mg ritonavir BID. End of Study Definition The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study shown in the SoA for the last participant in the trial globally. A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all periods of the study, including the last visit as shown in the SoA."
