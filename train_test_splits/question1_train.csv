" candida is a type of fungus that is normally found in small amounts in the human body. sometimes, too much candida can grow in the body and cause health problems. this is known as a candida infection. the name invasive candida infection is used when the infection has spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream. certain medicines or diseases, like cancer, may make a child more likely to develop an invasive candida infection. anidulafungin is a medicine that is currently used to treat candida infections in adults. this study was designed to learn more about using anidulafungin to treat candida infections in children. anidulafungin has not been approved for use in children, as it is still being studied. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety of anidulafungin in children with invasive candida infection. the researchers wanted to answer this question:  did the children in this study have any new or worsening medical problems? if so, what new or worsening medical problems did the children have? the researchers also wanted to learn more about how anidulafungin works to treat invasive candida infection in children. the researchers wanted to answer this question:  how many children were cured or had an improvement in candida infection? ","protocol summary this prospective, open-label, non-comparativestudywill assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of intravenous (iv) anidulafungin when used to treat children aged 1month to <18 years with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia(icc). the primary study objective is to assess the safety andtolerability of anidulafungin when used to treat children with icc. additional assessments will include global response at the end of iv therapy (eoivt) and subsequent time points, exposure-response relationship, the rates of relapse (recurrence)and newinfection at follow up (fu) visits, and analysis of time to death during study therapy and follow-up visits. a sub-study to explore the pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters in children aged 1month to <2 years will be performed on a limited number of subjects prior to complete enrollment of this age group in this study. indication: primary therapy of invasive candidiasis, including candidemia, in children between the ages of 1 month and <18 years. background and rationale: the incidence of systemic invasive fungal infections has risen significantly in the past decade. infections due to candidaspp. account for about80% of all systemic fungal infections and are the fourth leading cause of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the united states.1 the impact of fungal infections on health care and economic expenditures is large and of growing concern. increases in infection rates are a consequence of growing numbers of at-risk subjects due to advances in transplantation technology and oncology treatment, spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), use of vascular catheters, and extensive administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. in the united states, mortality rates in children with candidemiaapproach 30%, depending on the specific subject population and clinical setting.2, 3 current approved treatments for infections due to candidaspp. include polyenes, azoles and echinocandin antifungal agents. of these, amphotericin b and fluconazole are the most commonly utilized in the paediatric population. guidelines for use of these agents in the paediatricpopulation have often been extrapolated from adult studies. anidulafungin is a member of the echinocandin class of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal activity against candidaspecies. in the united states, anidulafungin is approved for the treatment of candidemia and other forms of candidainfections (intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis) in adults. in canada and europe, anidulafungin carries a similar indication and is approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia in adult non-neutropenic patients. to date, there are no clinical studies evaluating anidulafungin in paediatricpatients with invasive candidainfection. this studywill assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and exposure-response relationships of anidulafungin will also be assessed in a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic(pk-pd) analysis. anidulafungin is a semi-synthetic lipopeptide synthesized from a fermentation product of aspergillus nidulans. it acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of (1, 3)--d-glucan synthase, an enzyme required for synthesis of the cell wall in many pathogenic fungi. suppression of cell wall glucan synthesis leads to osmotic instability and eventual cell death. anidulafungin is active in vitro against a number of important pathogenic organisms, including candidaspp., aspergillus spp., and pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly p. carinii). it is at least as potent as and often more potent than amphotericin b and fluconazole against candidaand aspergillus spp. activity of anidulafungin against candidaspp. is fungicidal and has been demonstrated under avariety of growth conditions. in animal models, anidulafungin has cleared candidafrom internal organs and mucosa and led to prolonged survival in lethal infections. anidulafungin demonstrated efficacy in studies in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent mice systemically infected with c. albicans or c. glabrata (including fluconazole-and amphotericin b-resistant isolates), immunosuppressed rabbits with fluconazole-resistant esophageal and oropharyngeal candidiasis, and persistently neutropenic rabbits with disseminated c. albicans candidiasis. study design this prospective, open-label, non-comparative study will assess the safety and efficacy of anidulafungin when used to treat children between the ages of 1month and <18 years with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia(icc). to participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a confirmed diagnosis of icc (based on the growth of candidasp. from a culture obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or mycological evidence highly suggestive of candidasp. (eg, the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct microscopic visualization of yeast, hyphae or pseudohyphae from asample obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment)"
" transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (attr-pn) is a rare and life-threatening medical condition which worsens over time. there are about 10,000 people in the world known to have attr-pn. people with this condition have a particular protein, known as transthyretin amyloid, in their nerves. this can lead to problems with the nervous system, such as weakness, numbness, or pain in the hands and feet (known as neuropathy) and difficulty walking. attr-pn is caused by a genetic mutation (change) in the transthyretin (ttr) gene. the most common genetic mutation that causes attr-pn is called val30met. tafamidis is a study drug approved in some countries to treat adult patients with attr-pn to delay neurologic symptoms. the researchers in this study were interested in learning more about the long-term safety and effects of tafamidis. this study had several purposes:  to continue to study if tafamidis is safe and the potential effects of tafamidis in patients with attr-pn over the long-term.  to continue to provide tafamidis to patients with attr-pn who had participated in previous clinical trials for tafamidis and were benefiting from taking it.

" transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is a type of heart disease that is caused by a certain kind of protein building up in the heart muscle. this protein is called transthyretin, or ttr. ttr is normally made by your liver and carries things like hormones and vitamin a throughout your body. in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, ttr breaks apart and clumps together in fibers called amyloid. these amyloid fibers build up in the heart muscle and cause it to become stiff, eventually resulting in heart failure. researchers are looking for new treatments that can help patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy live longer. tafamidis meglumine (also known as vyndaqel and another form of tafamidis, vyndamax) is a drug that is now approved in the united states and other countries to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. tafamidis was still an investigational drug when this study began. tafamidis works by keeping ttr from breaking apart and forming into amyloid fibers. researchers think that this slows down the buildup of amyloid fibers in the heart muscle, which helps slow down the rate at which the heart disease gets worse over time. this study was an extension of the study fx1b-201, which treated transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy patients with tafamidis for 12 months. the main purpose of the current study was to measure how safe tafamidis treatment is over a longer period of time. another purpose of this study was to give patients who took part in study fx1b-201 access to tafamidis treatment for up to 10 additional years. to measure the safety of long-term tafamidis treatment, the researchers in this study asked:  what medical problems and serious medical problems did patients have while taking tafamidis?  how long did patients live while taking tafamidis?

" venous thromboembolism, or vte, is the name for a blood clot that forms in the body. vte can happen in a vein located in different parts of the body, including the legs, the arms, the groin, the lungs, or other parts of the body. a vte can be life-threatening if not treated. certain children may be more likely to have a vte, such as those with cancer or other serious conditions that require hospitalization. vte may be treated or prevented with a type of medicine called an anticoagulant, also known as a blood thinner. one anticoagulant that is used is called dalteparin. it is given as an injection under the skin. dalteparin has been approved for use in adults with vte in the united states and europe, but has not been approved in children because additional studies are needed to find out if dalteparin could be a useful medicine for children. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use of dalteparin in children with or without cancer, and to help determine the appropriate dose of dalteparin for treating vte in children. the study doctors collected blood samples from the children and did a blood test to find out what the anti-xa level was after certain doses of dalteparin were given. the anti-xa level shows how well dalteparin makes blood clots go away or stops a blood clot from forming. specifically, the study doctors wanted to answer these questions:  what effect would dalteparin, given at different doses, have on the bodies of children, including children with cancer and children without cancer?  what would be the average dalteparin dose required to treat vte in children, based on age and weight?  how long did it take the childrens anti-xa test results to reach target levels?

" what is juvenile idiopathic arthritis? this study was conducted in participants diagnosed with 1 of 3 different types (or subtypes) of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia). jia is an autoimmune condition, which means the immune system that normally helps a person fight an infection instead attacks the persons own body. in jia, this happens in the joints causing swelling (inflammation) and stiffness. jia is a common autoimmune disease in children and includes a group of conditions that involve joint inflammation that first appears before the age of 16 years and lasts on oligoarthritis  eojia 6  era tendon, hips, knees,  psa which what is etanercept? etanercept is sold as enbrel and is a type of medicine approved for use in adults with active moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (ra), which causes painful, swollen, and stiff joints, active and progressive psa, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, severe ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis are types of arthritis of the backbone that can causes pain and swelling in the back. etanercept is also approved in many countries for the treatment of jia and in some countries for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in children. this study tested to see if etanercept was safe to use over a long time in children and adolescents. what was the purpose of this study? researchers wanted to find out about the safety of etanercept in children and adolescents when it was taken for up to 10 years (2 years in study b1801014 and 8 years in study b1801023). researchers wanted to know:  did participants who took etanercept for up to 10 years develop cancer or have lots of serious medical problems? "," 1. INTRODUCTION Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common autoimmune-autoinflammatory diseasein childhood and affects approximately 1 in 1,000 children. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment options, JIA remains a chronic condition for most affected children. Etanercept is approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to treat pediatric patients with polyarticular JIA aged 2 years and above, who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. In addition, etanercept is approved by the EMA for use in pediatric patients with severe plaque psoriasis from the ages of 6 to 17 years. Etanercept binds specifically to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and blocks its interaction with cell surface TNF receptors. TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. It plays an important role in the inflammatory processes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polyarticularJIA, and the resulting joint pathology. Elevated levels of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of RA patients and in both the synovium and psoriatic plaques of patients with psoriatic arthritis.1 1.1. Indication Etanercept is a TNF inhibitor that is being developed for the treatment of extended oligoarticular JIA, enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in pediatric patients. 1.2. Background and Rationale JIA is a clinically heterogeneous group of several disease types that are characterized by arthritis beginning before the age of 16 years with symptoms persisting for more than 6weeks. The International League Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification defines 7 distinct subtypes of JIA: systemic arthritis, oligoarthritis (persistent oligoarthritis, extended polyarticular), polyarthritis rheumatoid factor (RF) positive, polyarthritis RF negative, PsA, ERA, and undifferentiated arthritis. Protocol 0881A1-3338 (B1801014) was designed to assess the clinical benefit and the long-term safety of etanercept for 2 years in pediatric subjects with extended oligoarticular JIA, ERA or PsA. Protocol B1801023 is an 8-year extension study designed to further characterize the long-term safety profile,includingmalignancy and other serious adverse events, and clinical benefit for those pediatric subjects whoreceived at least one dose of etanercept and completed 96 weeks of investigational product and/or follow-up in study 0881A1-3338. At the time of the original approved B1801023 protocol, the product label allowedfor the use of etanercept in polyarticularJIA, regardless of JIA onset type (refer to the current version of the Summary of Product Characteristics of etanercept for the latest approved indications).2 The approval of etanercept in this indication was based on a controlled study which mainly enrolled subjects with polyarticular-onset JIA. Because of the relative paucity of data in other JIA subtypes, this study is being conducted to assess the long-term safety and clinical August 2012, the sponsor was granted approval to extend the indication for JIAto include three new subtypes of the disease and to include long-term safety information for the JIA population, together with reclassification of the licensed indication of polyarticular JIA into the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive) and polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor negative). Although the risk-benefit profile of etanercept in JIA has been well characterized, littleis known about when or how to discontinue etanercept treatment in patients with JIA after a good clinical response has been achieved, nor are there guidelines from recognized bodies to define criteria for discontinuing treatment of etanercept.3 Thus, the decision to temporarily hold or completely stop therapy is currently a clinical one made between the health care provider and the patient, and is not based on clinical practice guidelines. The criteria for clinically inactive disease in oligoarticular (persistent and extended), polyarticular (RF positive and negative), and systemic JIA have recently been revised by Wallace. Clinically inactive disease is defined as 1) nojoints with active arthritis;2) fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy attributable to JIA; 3) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level within normal limits; 4)Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of disease activity score of best possible on scale used; 5) duration of morning stiffness of  15 minutes; and 6) no active uveitis.4 There are some limited data from retrospective studies in the literature regarding discontinuation of etanercept during disease remission. These data provide some support for the concept that etanercept can be withdrawn during remission, and in the event of relapse, restarted with a good clinical response. Remesal et al analyzed the progress of patients with JIA after discontinuation of etanercept and the clinical response to re-introduction of the drug in those who relapsed.5 This retrospective chart review of patients between 2004 to 2009revealed that therapy with etanercept had been discontinued in 26 patients with JIA who had achieved inactive disease using the original definition from Wallace et al for clinically inactive disease.6 They note that the majority of patients (69%) relapsed after discontinuation of etanercept, the probability of remaining symptom-free at 6 months was 50%, and the response to re-introduction of treatment was satisfactory. They concluded that etanercept can be discontinued after an as-yet undetermined period of disease inactivity, given that even if there is a relapse of disease patients will respond to re-introduction of etanercept. Prince et al found similar results in 9 patients with JIA who experienced relapse after withdrawal of etanercept.7 Unlike Remesal et al, they found the period of remission after discontinuation of etanercept was not associated with the duration of inactive disease before the withdrawal of treatment nor the method of withdrawal used (i.e., tapering of treatment versus abrupt cessation), and all 8 patients re-treated with etanercept achieved subsequent remission of disease activity promptly. Finally, a retrospective chart review of 171 JIA patients receiving anti-TNF agents, between 1998 and 2009 has recently been reported by Baszis et al.8 Of the 171 patients included in the review, 75% received etanercept. Similar to the findings of Prince et al, no correlation between the risk of flare and the length of anti-TNF therapy after inactive disease was achieved was observed in this study.

" epilepsy is a condition in which a person has recurring seizures. epilepsy occurs in both adults and children and can affect multiple daily life activities. a seizure is a sudden increase in electrical activity in the brain. seizures can cause many different symptoms, such as shaking, feeling confused, or losing control of your body. when a seizure occurs in only one part of the brain, it is known as a partial onset seizure. when a seizure occurs throughout the whole brain, it is known as a generalized seizure. the most common type of generalized seizure is a primary generalized tonic-clonic (pgtc) seizure. participants were asked to take part in this research study because they were diagnosed with epilepsy with either partial onset or pgtc seizures. pregabalin is the medicine that was used during this study. pregabalin is prescribed by doctors for the treatment of partial onset seizures in young children and adults. pregabalin is not approved for the treatment of pgtc seizures. the purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety of pregabalin in children with partial onset seizures, and in children and adults with pgtc seizures. ","protocol summary indication: adjunctive therapy for children with partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization and adjunctive therapy for children and adults with primary generalized tonic-clonic (pgtc) seizures. background and rationale: epilepsy is a common disorder in childhood affecting 4 to 5 ofevery 1000 children. although epilepsy is often well controlled with existing antiepileptic drug (aed) therapy, more than 25% of pediatric patients have seizures that are uncontrolled by currently available agents, or have adverse effects related to aedsthat complicate management of their seizures. in addition, children with epilepsy often suffer from impaired academic performance, with 55% functioning below their grade level and an additional 16% significantly behind in educational training.1 children with epilepsy also have a higher likelihood of developing behavioral difficulties, which may persist into adulthood.2 early age of onset and a higher number of total lifetime seizures are the strongest correlates of academic underachievement. therefore, the availability of a new aed that has been shown to improve seizure control,and that is generally well tolerated,is needed. pregabalin (lyrica) is analpha -delta ( )agent approved for use the treatment of partial 2 2 onset seizures in adults. it is believed to exert its pharmacologic action by binding to the  site of voltage-gated calcium channels. the spectrum of activity of pregabalin in rodent 2models of epilepsy shows that it is potent to reduce or prevent both partial seizures from hippocampal stimulation and also primary generalized tonic-clonic(pgtc) seizures from either sound stimulation to genetically audiogenic mice or cranial electroshock in mice or rats.12 the efficacy of pregabalin in patients with pgtc seizures has not been assessed to date in a placebo-controlled study. pregabalin is approved in more than 100countries, with indications summarized below for the united states (us), european union (eu), and japan (jp). in the us and eu, pregabalin is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of adult patients with partial onset seizures. in addition, pregabalin is indicated for the treatment of central and peripheral neuropathic pain (eu), and for the management of neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathyand for fibromyalgia (us) and for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain (jp). in the eu, pregabalin is also approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults. the approved dose range for the adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in adults is 150 to 600mg/day, administered 2times daily (bid)or3times daily(tid). themost common adverse effects reported with pregabalin in placebo-controlledadjunctive trialsin adults with partial onset seizures were dizziness and somnolence. since initial market approval of lyrica in 2004, it is estimated that more than 11,700,000patient-years of exposurehave accumulated worldwide. more detailed information, including efficacy results in adults and the possible risks associated with administration of pregabalin, are summarized in the investigators brochure which serves as the single reference safety document for this study. study a0081106will assess thelong term (12month) safety and tolerability of pregabalin in pediatric subjectsas adjunctive treatment for partial onset seizures and as adjunctive treatment in pediatric and adult subjects with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. this study is one of several studies that will be conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of pregabalin in pediatric subjects with epilepsy and address post approval commitments to us and eu regulatory authorities. objectives:  to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of pregabalin in pediatric subjects 1month through 16 years of age with partial onset seizures and pediatric and adult subjects 5-65 years of age with pgtc seizures. study design: this is an open-label, flexible-dose study in pediatric subjects 1month through 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures, who have participated in study a0081041 (4-16 years of age) or study a0081042 (1month-3 years of age) or pediatric and adult subjects 5-65 years of age with pgtc seizures who have participated in study a0081105. subjects who have completed the studies cited above will be eligible for screening for this study. for subjects who have participated in, but did not completestudies a0081041, a0081042, or a0081105, eligibility for study a0081106 will be considered, after consultation with the study clinician, on a case by case basis. a minimum of 4weeks in the double-blind treatment phase of either study a0081041 or study a0081105 will be required for consideration of enrollment into study a0081106. selected sites (within the united states only) that are not participating in studies a0081041 or a0081042 may screen and enroll pediatric subjects (1month to 16 years of a"
" what is ulcerative colitis? ulcerative colitis (uc) is a long-term inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. uc affects the mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. patients with uc experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as flares. flares are characterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and presence of blood in the stools, as well as sense of urgency. flares are followed by periods of remission (time with no symptoms) that vary in length from weeks to years. there is no known cure for uc. treatment can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of uc and can even lead to long-term remission. however, there are few treatment options for patients with moderately to severely active uc. medication is the most common treatment for uc. what is tofacitinib? tofacitinib is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. it is an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been approved, and is available by prescription, to treat adults with active, moderate to severe uc that did not respond well to other medications. what was the purpose of this study? researchers did this study to learn more about the safety of tofacitinib in participants with uc when taken over a long period of time. researchers wanted to know: how many participants had medical problems during this study? ","protocol summary indication: tofacitinib, also known astofacitinib citrate or cp-690,550, is being developed for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. background and rationale: tofacitinibis a potent, selective inhibitor of the jak family of kinases with a high degree of selectivity against other kinases in the human genome. in kinase assays, tofacitinibinhibits jak1, jak2, jak3, and to a lesser extent tyk2. in cellular settings where jak kinases signal in pairs, tofacitinibpreferentially inhibits signaling by heterodimers containingjak3 and/or jak1 with functional selectivity over jak2 homodimer signaling. inhibition of jak1 and jak3 by tofacitinibblocks signaling through the common gamma chain containing receptors for several cytokines, including il-2, -4,-7,-9, -15 and -21. these cytokines are integral to lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and function, and inhibition of their signaling may thus result in modulation of multiple aspects of the immune response. in addition, inhibition of jak1 will result in attenuation of signaling by additional pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as il-6 and ifn. at higher exposures, inhibition of erythropoietin, prolactin and other hormones could occur via inhibition of jak2 homodimer signaling. the broad effects of jak1/3 inhibition on multiple cytokine pathways provides the rationale for developing tofacitinibas treatment for several diseases in which lymphocyte activation/proliferation plays a pathogenic role. tofacitinibis being studiedas an oral treatment for ulcerative colitis (uc), crohns disease, as a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (dmard) for the treatment of ra, as treatment for plaque psoriasis and for the prevention of renal allograft rejection. objectives and endpoints: primary objective  to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term tofacitinibtherapy in subjects with uc. secondary objectives  to evaluate the efficacy of long-term tofacitinibtherapy in subjects with uc.  to evaluatethe effect of long-term tofacitinibtherapy on quality-of-life in subjects with uc. primary efficacy endpoint  as this is an open-label extension study, there will be no primary efficacy endpoint. secondary efficacy endpoints  the proportion of subjects inremission at month2, month 12, month 24 and month 36. remission in this study is defined as a mayoscore 2 with no individual subscore >1, and rectal bleeding subscore of 0.  the proportion of subjects in clinical remission at month2, month 12, month24 and month 36. clinical remission in this study is defined as a mayo score 2 with no individual subscore >1.  the proportion of subjects in partial mayo score (pms) remission over time. pms remission in this study is defined as a partial mayo score 2 withno individual subscore >1.  the proportion of subjects who achieve mucosal healing at month 2, month 12, month 24 and month36. mucosal healing is defined as a mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1.  the proportion of subjects with total score in inflammatorybowel disease questionnaire (ibdq) 170 over time. safety endpoints  incidence and severity of adverse events (aes).  incidence of serious infections.  incidence and severity of clinical laboratory abnormalitiesand change from baseline in clinical laboratory values.  incidence of vital sign abnormalitiesand change from baseline in vital signs.  incidence of clinically significant changesin physical examinations from baseline.  incidence of electrocardiogram (ecg) abnormalities during treatment.  summaryof adjudicated safetyevents (eg, cardiovascular, malignancy, opportunistic infections).  proportion of subjects with addition of lipid lowering agents. study design: this is a phase3, multi-center, open-label study in subjects who have completed or demonstrated treatment failure in the maintenance study a3921096, or who were non-responders after completing induction studies a3921094 or a3921095. approximately 900subjects are expected to become eligible for the study. this study will continue up to approximately july2020. individual subject duration of participation will vary depending on when the subject was enrolled into the study andthe end date of approximately july2020. therefore, the duration of participation for an individual subject may range from approximately4 years to more than 7 years. if the study continues beyond year6for an individual subject, the investigator should continue to follow the same visit schedule and study procedures outlined during the study visits of year4. subjects who completed study a3921096 or had early withdrawal due to treatment failure as defined in the a3921096 protocol may be eligible to enroll in this study, a3921139. in addition, subjects who complete inductionstudya3921094 or a3921095 and are classified as non-responders may be eligible to enroll in this study. the eligibility of a subject for this study will b"
" neurogenic detrusor overactivity, or ndo, is a bladder condition associated with damage to the nervous system. ndo may be caused by injury or disease to the spinal cord, including certain conditions that are present from birth. people with ndo may not be able to control their bladder and may not be able to hold as much urine in their bladder as other people can, so they may have urine leakage or need to urinate frequently. additionally, ndo can cause damage to the kidneys and urinary tract if it goes unchecked. current treatment options are limited for children and adolescents with ndo, so researchers are looking for new medicines that may help young people with this condition. fesoterodine was the investigational medicine tested in this study. fesoterodine has not been approved for use in children or adolescents, outside of research studies like this one. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use and safety of fesoterodine in children and adolescents with ndo. researchers asked this main question:  did bladder capacity increase following 12 weeks of treatment with fesoterodine? to answer this question, the researchers measured each patients bladder capacity (maximum volume of urine that can be held in the bladder before the patient needs to urinate) 2 times: before the patients started study medicine, and again after the patient had taken study medicine for 12 weeks. they compared each patients first result to their second result. "," 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Indication Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic drug that is being developed for the treatment of symptoms associated with a neurological condition (eg, spina bifida) in subjects aged 6-17 years, hereafter referred to as neurogenic detrusor overactivity or NDO. 1.2. Background and Rationale At least 25% of clinical problems seen in pediatric urology are the result of neurogenic lesions that affect lower urinary tract function (Bauer,et al 2002).1 The principal causes may be classified as acquired or congenital in origin, with the vast majority of bladder dysfunction in children related to neural tube defects, most commonly myelomeningocele (Aslan & Kogan, 2002).2 Neurogenic detrusor overactivity is associated with involuntary contractions of the detrusor muscle, defined as detrusor overactivity, which occur as the bladder fills. This can only be diagnosed with cystometric evaluation (Neveus, et al, 2006).3 The outcome of upper urinary tract function is related to detrusor and urethral sphincter function. In dyssynergistic dysfunction, detrusor and urethral sphincter contraction is uncoordinated (detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia) resulting in high intravesical pressures, vesicoureteric reflux, and ultimately renal damage (Coward & Saleem, 2001);4 (Aslan & Kogan, 2002).2 In children with myelodysplasia, the risk of upper urinary tract (UUT) deterioration and renal damage approaches 80% when no intervention is instituted (Bauer et al, 2002).1 In atonic dysfunction, although a lack of detrusor and (usually) sphincter activity results in a low pressure bladder generally protecting the urinary tract, incontinence then becomes a problem (Coward & Saleem, 2001);4 (Aslan & Kogan, 2002).2 Treatment of NDO in children depends on presentation, underlying cause, and the risk of deterioration in function of both upper and lower urinary tract. Clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) is first line therapy for bladder emptying in children with areflexic bladders and high postvoid residual urine volume, and may be combined with antimuscarinic therapy in specific populations, eg, patients with high pressure bladders as below (Aslan & Kogan, 2002);2 (Kennelly & DeVoe, 2008).5 Drug Development Rationale Antimuscarinic drugs are the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy in the pediatric NDO population, and have been shown to improve intravesicular pressure, and decrease symptoms. Four antimuscarinic drugs (oxybutynin, trospium chloride, tolterodine and darifenacin) have only oxybutynin is widely approved for use in children, and is available as a once a day extended release (XL) tablet, as well as an immediate release tablet. Although effective, oxybutynin use has been limited by a side effect profile which may have particular relevance in the pediatric population where development (eg, physical, cognitive, psychosocial) is still ongoing. A particular medications effectiveness is highly dependent on patient compliance which is itself dependent on tolerability. Given individual differences in toleration and the limited choice available there is an unmet need for alternative treatments. Children with NDOtherefore represent a disease population with a need for an alternative effective, safe and well-tolerated therapy to help manage the overactive detrusor, reducing or preventing incontinence, as well as the high pressure bladder contractions that can result in UUT deterioration and renal damage. Other treatments such as alpha blockers, anxiolytics, tricyclic antidepressants, intravesical oxybutynin, botulinum-A toxin, electrical stimulation and biofeedback, may also be used (Coward & Saleem, 2001)4 although safety and efficacy havenot been reliably demonstrated. Acetylcholine which interacts with muscarinic receptors at the detrusor is the predominant peripheral neurotransmitter responsible for bladder contraction. Both fesoterodine and oxybutynin are muscarinic receptor antagonists and consequently have a role in mediating detrusor overactivity. Fesoterodine is anantimuscarinic drug available as a prolonged release (PR) tablet formulation, and is approved in Europe and the USA at doses of 4 mg and 8 mg once daily for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB)in adults; it is not approved for use in the pediatric population. Fesoterodine functions as aprodrugof 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine (5-HMT). After oral administration, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma, as it is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to 5-HMT, which is the principal active moiety responsible for the antimuscarinic effects of fesoterodine. Clinical Safety Data Adverse effects characteristic of antimuscarinic drugs,eg, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, micturition difficulties, dry eyes, and dry throat were observed in Phase 1 studies with fesoterodine doses up to 28 mg once daily. In a double-blind, randomized, parallel- group, placebo-and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg/day) thorough QT study with fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg/day doses, fesoterodine did not prolong the QTc interval. Fesoterodine PR has been evaluated in Phase 2 and Phase 3 controlled studies in 2859 OAB patients. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine 4 mg/day and 785 received fesoterodine 8 mg/day for treatment periods of 8 or 12 weeks. The most common adverse event in Phase 3 was dry mouth, with a reported incidence of 19% with fesoterodine 4 mg and 35% with fesoterodine 8 mg, compared to 7% with placebo. Most of the cases were mild to moderate"
" persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (pphn) is a serious condition that can affect the breathing of newborn infants and prevent them from getting enough oxygen. oxygen is a gas that is present in the air and all human and animals need this gas to live and grow. the main symptoms of pphn includes fast breathing and increased heart rate as well as a blue tint to the skin, flaring of the nostrils in the nose, and sometimes the baby can make a grunting noise. pphn is seen in about 2 births in every 1000 births, and around 1 in 10 babies who have breathing problems will have pphn. the normal treatment for pphn is to give babies nitric oxide gas to breathe. this inhaled nitric oxide only helps 2 out of every 3 babies to get enough oxygen. if the inhaled nitric oxide doesnt help the baby, the next step for doctors is to try extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ecmo. ecmo is a way of getting oxygen into the babys blood with a machine and can help if the lungs and/or heart arent working properly. the lungs are air sacs that fill with oxygen-containing air and the lungs are used to get oxygen into the blood. sometimes babies with pphn will pass away even if they receive treatment with inhaled nitric oxide and/or ecmo. other babies will survive, but they may have developmental problems that make it hard for them to grow, learn things, and hear sounds. new treatment options are needed to help the heart and lungs get enough oxygen into the babys blood. revatio (sildenafil citrate) is a medicine that can help blood vessels in the lungs relax. by doing this, the amount of blood that can flow to and from the lungs in these blood vessels is increased, which may help get oxygen to where it is needed. the researchers did this study to see if sildenafil given by infusion along with inhaled nitric oxide was able to help improve breathing in babies with pphn or babies with hypoxic respiratory failure (hrf) who are likely to get pphn. in an infusion, the medicine is slowly dripped from a bag into a tube that is connected to a needle, which has been injected or pushed through a patients skin into a vein. the vein then carries the medicine in the blood around the body. ","protocol summary background and rationale neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (pphn) or hypoxic respiratory failure (hrf) who do not respond to comprehensivesupportive intensive care measures are typically treatedwith inhaled nitric oxide (ino), which is considered standard therapy. inhaled nitric oxide treatment increases the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (pao ) by dilating pulmonary vessels in better ventilated areas of the lung, redistributing 2 pulmonary blood flow away from regions with low ventilation. inhaled nitric oxide appears to reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) in hrf, while mortality is not affected.1 however, treatment with ino is not effective for all patientsand requires continued intubation and artificial ventilation. sildenafil citrate is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type5 (pde5), which is found in high concentrations in the lungs. inhibition of pde5 should enhance the vasodilatory effects of naturally occurring and inhaled nitric oxide, promoting relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, and increasing blood flow. therefore, sildenafil may have utility in the treatment of neonates with pphn and hrf at risk for pphn. case reports ofoff-label use of sildenafil in conjunction with ino indicate that sildenafil could enhance the efficacy of ino and reduce the time on ino therapy. the effects of the addition of iv sildenafil to standard ino therapy in the acute stage of this disease will be studied in this clinical study. objectives  the primary objectives of this study areto evaluate the efficacyand safety of iv sildenafil when added to ino for the treatment of neonates with pphn or hrf and at risk for pphn.  the secondary objectives of this study are to evaluatethe developmental progress of patients with pphn treated with iv sildenafil or placebo, 12 and 24months after the end of study treatment. endpoints part a: co-primary endpoints: assessed at day14 or hospital discharge, whichever occurs first:  time on ino treatment after initiation of iv study drug for subjects without treatment failure;  treatment failure rate, defined as need for additional treatment targeting pphn, need for ecmo, or death during the study. secondary endpoints:assessed at day 14 or hospital discharge, whichever occurs first:  time to final weaning of mechanical ventilation for pphn;  time from initiation of study drug to treatment failure; each component will also be evaluated separately;  proportion of subjects with individual components of treatment failure (needing additional treatment targeting pphn, needing ecmo, or who die);  change in oi at 6, 12, and 24hours from baseline;  change in differential saturation (pre-and post-ductal)at 6, 12, and 24hours from baseline;  change in p/f ratio at 6, 12, and 24hours from baseline;  sildenafil and its majormetabolite uk-103,320 plasma concentrations and the corresponding pk parameters obtainedfrom a population pk analysis; and  safety parameters: incidence and severity of adverse events and abnormal laboratory parameters."

" what is meningococcal disease? invasive meningococcal disease is an illness which may cause a serious infection in the blood, as well as swelling around the brain and spinal cord. meningococcal disease is more common in young children than adults. children who get this illness are at risk for hearing loss and other disabilities. however, invasive meningococcal disease may be prevented with a vaccine. a vaccine is a type of medicine that helps people fight off germs. meningococcal disease is caused by the meningococcus germ. there are different types of this germ. for example, meningococcal type a disease is caused by the meningococcus a germ. what are menacwy-tt and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine? menacwy-tt (nimenrix) is a vaccine approved for the prevention of meningococcal disease. this vaccine targets 4 common types of meningococcus germ: a, c, y, and w. it is given by injection into the muscle. some children in this study also received another vaccine, called 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (prevenar 13). prevenar 13 is often given at the same time as menacwy-tt. prevenar 13 targets 13 common types of the pneumococcus germ, which can cause ear infections or other serious infections. it is given by injection into the muscle. for this study, menacwy-tt was considered an investigational vaccine, which means that its still being studied. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and effects of menacwy-tt in toddler-aged children, when given alone or together with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. researchers wanted to know: would children have an immune response against meningococcus germs 1 month after receiving their last dose of menacwy-tt? would children still have an immune response against meningococcus germs 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after receiving their last dose of menacwy-tt? to answer these questions, researchers collected blood samples from the children. the researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of meningococcus germ. antibodies are special proteins made by the body that can recognize and help kill germs. this is known as an immune response. antibodies may protect children from getting sick when they come into contact with meningococcus germs. ","SYNOPSIS Detailed Title A Phase III, randomised, open, controlled, multicentre, primary vaccination study to evaluate the immunogenicity and persistence of 1 and 2 doses of meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-TT in toddlers (after 1 month and up to 5 years) and to demonstrate non-inferiority of co-administration of MenACWY-TT and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevenar 13versus separate administration of the 2 vaccines. Indication Active immunisation of individuals from 12 months of age against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, W-135 and Y. Rationale for the Rationale for the study study and study Current data from clinical studies with the MenACWY-TT vaccine design suggest that a single dose in toddlers provides sufficient protection. However, data on the possible advantage of administrating two vaccine doses are not available for toddlers around 12 months of age at the time of vaccination. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) requested GSK to conduct a study to evaluate the immediate and longer term antibody titres elicited by one or two doses of MenACWY-TT administered in children aged 12-23 months. This study was therefore designed to evaluate the immunogenicity of one and two doses of MenACWY-TT administered to unprimed toddlers during their second year of life. Several European countries recommend a booster dose of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine between 11 and 15 months of age. This study will also beconducted to demonstrate that co- administration of meningococcal vaccine MenACWY-TT with the booster dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevenar 13does not adverselyimpact the immunogenicity of either of the vaccines. The safety profile of both vaccines will also be evaluated. Rationale for the study design The study contains 4 study groups:  The ACWY1d group will receive 1 dose of MenACWY-TT at Visit 1. For this study group, Prevenar 13is not considered as a study vaccine and has to be administered after Visit 2.  The ACWY2d group will receive 2 doses of MenACWY-TT 2 months apart (at Visits 1 and 3). For this study group, Prevenar 13is not considered as a studyvaccine and has to be administered between the 2 doses of MenACWY-TT (after the Visit 2 blood sampling up to 30days before the second dose of MenACWY-TT) or after Visit 4.  The Co-ad group will receive 1 dose of MenACWY-TT and 1 dose of Prevenar 13at Visit 1.  The PCV-13 group will receive 1 dose of Prevenar 13at Visit 1 and 1 dose of MenACWY-TT 2 months later (Visit 3). The immunogenicity and long-term persistence of one and two doses of MenACWY-TT administered at toddler age will be evaluated in the ACWY1d and ACWY2d groups. The data of the ACWY1d and ACWY2d groups after the first vaccine dose will be pooled (Pool1d group) and will be used as the control for the Co-ad group in terms of response to meningococcal antigens. The data of the PCV-13 group will be used as the control for the Co-ad group in terms of response to pneumococcal antigens. Objectives Primary Exploratory primary objectives  One month after administration of MenACWY-TT in the ACWY1d group and the ACWY2d group:  To evaluate the immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT vaccine after administration of 1 dose in groups ACWY1d and ACWY2d or 2 doses in group ACWY2d with respect to Serum Bactericidal Assay against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A using rabbit complement (rSBA-MenA), rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres.  One, three and five years after the last vaccination in the ACWY1d group and the ACWY2d group:  To evaluate the long-term persistence of the immune response induced by 1 or 2 doses of MenACWY-TT vaccine with respect to rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres. Confirmatory primary objectives The confirmatory primary objectives will be assessed in a hierarchical manner according to the order presented below. The second confirmatory primary objective can only be considered as met if the statistical criteria for both that objective and the first  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immune response to meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-TT when co-administered with 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine Prevenar 13 versus meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-TT given alone one month after vaccination.

" breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths in women. in 2012, about 1.7 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer and over 522,000 women died due to the disease. some people carry changes or mutations in their dna in genes called breast cancer susceptibility (brca) genes 1 and 2, or brca1 and brca2. brca gene mutations can be inherited by a child from one of their parents (germline). when a persons brca1 or brca2 genes contain mutations, it can cause breast cancer. researchers are looking for treatments for breast cancer patients with brca mutations that can help them have more time without their cancer getting worse. talazoparib (talzenna) is a drug that inhibits (stops) the normal activity of certain proteins called poly (adp-ribose) polymerases, also called parps. parps are proteins (made from genes which are part of dna) that are found in all normal and cancer cells that are involved in the repair of dna. parps are needed to repair mistakes that can happen in dna when cells divide. if the mistakes are not repaired, the cell will usually die and be replaced. cells with mistakes in their dna (like cells with brca1 and brca2 gene mutations) that do not die can become cancer cells. clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other parp inhibitors, can reduce tumor size or delay the cancer getting worse, and slow tumor growth in some cancer patients with brca1 or brca2 mutations. talazoparib is given in a capsule and is taken by mouth once daily at around the same time every day. talazoparib is now approved in the united states, the european union, and other countries for the treatment of patients with a certain type of breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumor (advanced) or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) and have an inherited brca1 or brca2 gene mutation. this study was done to see if talazoparib treatment could help patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and have inherited a brca1 or brca2 gene mutation, have more time without their cancer getting worse when compared to commonly used chemotherapies. researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of talazoparib. they monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study. ","SYNOPSIS Volume: NAME OF FINISHED PRODUCT: Talazoparib Page: NAME OF ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Reference: Talazoparib tosylate TITLE OF STUDY: A Phase 3, Open-Label, Randomized, Parallel, 2-Arm, Multi-Center Study of Talazoparib (BMN 673) versus Physicians Choice in Germline BRCA Mutation Subjects with Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer,Who Have Received Prior Chemotherapy Regimens for Metastatic Disease PROTOCOL NUMBER: 673-301 STUDY SITES: This study will be conducted at approximately 230sites internationally in 16countries (United States, Brazil, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, Israel, Australia, France, Germany, Italy,Belgium,Ireland, South Korea, Poland, Taiwan, Ukraine). Additional countries and sites may be added. PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT: Phase 3 STUDY RATIONALE: The mutation that predisposes breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)mutation carriers to cancer formation selectively renders tumor cells susceptible to poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition while sparing normal cells that, possessing a normal BRCA allele, are relatively resistant to PARP inhibition. The selection of appropriate therapy for metastatic breast cancer is complex because of the many treatment options and biologic heterogeneity of the disease, including several that have led to development of targeted therapeutics. Among others, the potential treatment options are influenced by estrogen and progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status of the tumor. Treatment options for subjects presenting with metastatic breast cancer may also be influenced by what adjuvant therapy wasused, how soon after adjuvant therapy the subject relapses, and by sites of metastasis. No therapies have been approved to date that take advantage of the well-defined vulnerability of BRCA mutant tumors. It would be a significant advance to provide a therapy which exploits the vulnerability of BRCA-mutant bearing tumors while sparing normal cells carrying one healthy BRCA allele. Medivation, Inc. 673-301 Amendment1 Page 3 NAME OF FINISHED PRODUCT: Talazoparib Page: NAME OF ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Reference: Talazoparib tosylate with the mixed data from small retrospective studies, underscores the lack of information for making treatment decisions for these subjects. The potential role of BRCA1 in mediation of taxane cytotoxicity is consistent with the observation that the taxanes may be less effective in treatment of BRCA1-associated metastatic breast cancer than sporadic disease. This coupled with the potential to specifically target the underlying genetic abnormality of the disease highlights the unmet need as well as the need for prospective evaluation of amolecularly rational, targeted therapy in comparison to the standard drugs used. While several agents have been shown to prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and some have modestly improved survival in metastatic breast cancer, the disease is, nevertheless, nearly uniformly fatal. Moreover, standard, non-targeted therapies are associated with substantial toxicity, which limits the quality of life of subjects while they are undergoing treatment. Two studies of the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, given as a single agent to breast cancer subjects have been published. In one study, subjects with germline BRCA mutations were treated with either 400 mg twice daily or 100 mg twice daily in a non-randomized fashion. Eleven of 27 subjects (41%) receiving the higher dose had objective responses while 6 of 27 (22%) of subjects receiving the lower dose responded.In a second trial, olaparib was evaluated in subjects with germline mutations as well as subjects with triple negative breast cancer in the absence of germline mutations. Ten subjects with germline mutations were enrolled, including 6 with measurable disease. While there were no objective responders, 5 subjects had stable disease. There were also no responders among 16 triple negative breast cancer subjects who either did not have germline BRCA mutations or had unknown BRCA status. In the Phase 1 study of talazoparib (also known as MDV3800, BMN 673), PRP-001, 18 breast cancer subjects with germline BRCA mutations, who had previously been treated with more than one chemotherapy regimen (range: 1 to 13), wereenrolled during dose escalation (n=6) and expansion (n=12) as of 31Mar2015. All 18 subjects were treated with talazoparibat dose levels of 900 to 1100 g/day including 12 in the expansion phase at 1000g/day (9 of the 12 subjects have been in the study for  3 cycles). Eightof 18 subjects have had objective responses, including one confirmed complete response (CR)in a subject with a "
" invasive meningococcal disease is an illness which may cause a serious infection in the blood, as well as swelling around the brain and spinal cord. meningococcal disease is more common in children than adults. children who get this illness are at risk for hearing loss and other disabilities. however, invasive meningococcal disease may be prevented with a vaccine. a vaccine is a type of medicine that helps people fight off germs. meningococcal disease is caused by the meningococcus germ. there are different types of this germ. for example, meningococcal type a disease is caused by the meningococcus a germ. menacwy-tt (nimenrix) is a vaccine approved in europe for the prevention of meningococcal disease. this vaccine targets 4 common types of meningococcus germ: types a, c, y, and w-135. it is given by injection into the muscle. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the long-term effects of nimenrix in healthy children, compared to 2 other vaccines against meningococcal disease, called meningitec and mencevax acwy. meningitec is aimed at preventing meningococcal diseases caused by the meningococcus c germ. mencevax is aimed at preventing meningococcal diseases caused by the menigococcus a, c, y, and w-135 germs. researchers wanted to know:  would children who received nimenrix still have antibodies against meningococcus germs at 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years after vaccination, compared to children who received meningitec or mencevax? to answer this question, researchers collected blood samples from the children. the researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against the 4 different types of meningococcus germ. antibodies are special proteins that can recognize and help kill germs. these antibodies can protect children from getting sick if they ever do come into contact with meningococcus germs. ","SYNOPSIS Detailed Title A phase IIIb, open, multi-center study to evaluate the long- term antibody persistence at 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years after the administration of one dose of the meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-TT versus one dose of Meningitec vaccine or one dose of the meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine Mencevax ACWY, and to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine administered 10 years after primary vaccination of 1-10 year old subjects with MenACWY-TT, Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY. Indication Active immunization of individuals from 12 months of age against invasive meningococcal diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135and Y. Rationale for the In study MenACWY-TT-027, 613 healthy subjects between 1 study and study and 10 years of age were randomized using a (3:1) ratio to design receive either a single dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine or a meningococcal C conjugate vaccine or a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The subjects were followed up for antibody persistence over five years post-vaccination in studies MenACWY-TT-028 through -032. The results showed that subjects vaccinated with MenACWY-TT between ages 1 and 2 years of age had detectable antibodies five years after vaccination in 73.5%, 77.6%, 34.7% and 42.9% of subjects against serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, respectively.

" lung cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the lungs. non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) is the most common type of lung cancer. some patients have nsclc that is referred to as alk-positive or ros1-positive. these patients have changes in their genes that can cause cancer cells to grow. the sponsor is developing an investigational medicine called lorlatinib to treat alk-positive and ros1-positive lung cancers. there are certain proteins called kinases that help cancer cells to grow. as they grow, the cancer cells can form into a tumor and spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain. lorlatinib may be able to block kinases, potentially reducing tumor size and stopping alk-positive and ros1-positive lung cancers from being able to grow and spread. lorlatinib is known as an alk-inhibitor medication. this was the first study to test lorlatinib in humans. at the time this study began, lorlatinib was not approved for use outside of research studies. since that time, lorlatinib has been approved in the united states for certain patients. the researchers wanted to learn more about the effects of lorlatinib, and to find the correct dose for treating alk-positive and ros1-positive lung cancer patients. this study was divided into 2 parts: phase 1 and phase 2. the purpose of the study was to answer the following questions:  for phase 1, what dose-limiting toxicities did patients have at each dose during their first treatment cycle? dose-limiting toxicities (dlts) are certain medical problems caused by taking lorlatinib which require the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the medicine (permanently or temporarily). dlts can be many things, and may include, for example, fever with a low count of white blood cells or swelling in the pancreas.  for phase 2, how many patients would have a reduction in tumor size after taking lorlatinib? ","protocol summary indication anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk)-positive (alk+) or ros oncogene 1(ros1)-positive (ros1+) advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). background and rationale pf-06463922 is a selective, atp competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor(tki) of the alk and ros1receptortyrosine kinases (rtk) that also potently inhibits alk kinase domain mutations responsible for resistance to crizotinib. oncogenic fusions of alk and ros1 define two distinct subsets of human lung adenocarcinoma patients and play essential roles in regulation of tumor cell survival, growth and metastasis. in vitro, pf-06463922demonstrated potent, concentration-dependent inhibition in catalytic activities of alk, alk mutants and ros1kinases in recombinant enzyme and cell based assays. pf-06463922also inhibited alk and ros1 dependent oncogenic functions in human nsclc cell lines, and demonstrated potent and selective growth inhibitory activity and induced apoptosis in tumor cell lines exhibiting either non mutant alk and ros1 fusion variants or mutant alk fusions that are acquired and resistant to crizotinib treatment. in vivo, pf-06463922demonstrated marked cytoreductive activity in mice bearing tumor xenografts that express alk or ros1fusion variants, including the crizotinib resistant eml4alkl1196m or eml4alkg1269a mutations. pf-06463922 treatment significantly reduced the tumor size and prolonged animal survival in the orthotopic brain models (eml4 alk and eml4alkl1196m) in mice. the anti tumor efficacy of pf-06463922 was dose dependent and demonstrated strong correlations to inhibition of alk or ros1 phosphorylation. the plasma levels associated with inhibitory activity of pf-06463922 against eml4alkl1196m phosphorylation and anti tumor efficacy in eml4alkl1196m dependent human nsclc cell line models was utilized to project target human plasma concentrations for clinical studies. there remains an unmet medical need to improve alk+ nsclc and ros1+ nsclc patientsoutcomes as no alkdirected compounds so far evaluated have demonstrated curative results. additional drugs are needed to overcome resistance mechanisms, to impact patient outcomes through improved response rates and progression free survival (pfs)and significant anti-tumor activity on central nervous system (cns)metastases. studyobjectives and endpoints phase 1portion of the study primary objective:  to assess safety and tolerability of pf-06463922as a single agent at increasing dose levels in patients with advanced alk+ or advanced ros1+ nsclc in order to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) and selectthe recommended phase2dose (rp2d). secondary objectives:  to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of pf-06463922.  to evaluate the single-and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic (pk)profiles of single-agent pf-06463922.  to detect early signs of cognitive dysfunction.  to evaluate patient reported outcomes (pro) of globalquality of life (qol) functioning, and the impact of pf-06463922on disease/treatment-related symptoms of lung cancer.  to evaluate the potential of single-agent pf-06463922 to cause cyp3a inhibition/induction using midazolam as a probe.  to characterize the effects of single-agent pf-06463922 on the qtc interval.  to evaluate tumor and blood-based molecular markers of response and resistance to single-agent pf-06463922.  tocharacterize the effect of food on pf-06463922.  to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of single-agent pf-06463922in patients with advanced alk+ nsclc or advanced ros1+ nsclc.  to evaluate response to prior systemic therapies. exploratory objectives:  to explore the brain penetration of single-agent pf-06463922. phase 2 portion of the study primary objective:  to evaluate overall (intra-and extracranial) and intracranial anti-tumor activity of single-agent pf-06463922at rp2d in patients with advanced alk+ nsclc or advanced ros1+ nsclc. secondary objectives:  to confirm the safety and tolerability of single-agent pf-06463922at the rp2d.  to confirm single-and multiple-dose pk profiles of single-agent pf-06463922 at the rp2d.  to assess secondary measures of clinical efficacy.  to detect early signs ofchanges in mood, cognitive function, or suicidal ideation and behavior (sib).  to evaluate patient reported outcomes (pro) of global qol, functioning and the impact of pf-06463922on disease/treatment-related symptoms of lung cancerat the rp2d.  to further evaluatethe effects of single-agent pf-06463922 at the rp2d on the qtc interval.  to further evaluate tumor and blood-based molecular markers of response and resistance to single-agent pf-06463922 at the rp2d.  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single-agent crizotinib following pf-06463922 intreatment-nave patients with advanced alk+ nsclc.  to evaluate response to prior systemic therapies. exploratory objectives:  to explore the brain penetration of single-agent pf-06463922at the rp2d. japanese patientonlylead-in cohort (lic) "
" people with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy have higher than normal levels of a particular protein in their heart. this increases the risk of having heart problems, like heart failure. tafamidis is a study drug that is being tested for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. tafamidis is currently approved to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in japan and the united states. tafamidis is not approved to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in other countries because it is still being tested. this study had 2 purposes:  to understand the safety of tafamidis: to see what medical problems patients had during the study  to look at controlling transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: to see if patients taking tafamidis were less likely to have a stay in hospital and less likely to die earlier because of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy ","protocol summary background and rationale: transthyretin amyloid disease is a rare and fatal condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid derived from transthyretin (a plasma protein) in various organs and tissues. deposition of ttr amyloid is associated with twodistinct clinical presentations: transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (ttr-fap) when the peripheral nerves are primarily affected and transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ttr-cm) when the heart is primarily affected. both ttr-fap and ttr-cm are associated with genetic variants of transthyretinbut ttr-cm may also occur in the absence of any genetic mutation and may be due to wild-type ttr amyloid deposition. at this time, with the exception of the approval of tafamidis for ttr-fap in the european union (eu)and japan, there are no approved pharmacotherapies for these conditions. ttr-cm occurs when ttr amyloid fibrils infiltrate the myocardium, leading to deposits of extracellular amyloid. deposition of transthyretin fibrils occurs between the myocardial cells and produces a thickening and stiffening of the myocardial tissue. this infiltration of the myocardium results in diastolic dysfunction progressing to restrictive cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and ultimately death. pfizer is developing tafamidis, an oral small molecule, for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid diseases. it has been demonstrated to bind selectively to ttr in human blood and slow fibril formation in vitro (razavi 2003).40 it binds to the 2thyroxine binding sites with negative cooperativity, exhibiting dissociation constants of 2 nm [kd1] and 154 nm [kd2] (devit 2006)11 and kinetically stabilizing the ttr tetramer when bound (sekijima2009).46 ttr stabilization has been hypothesized tolead to slowing or halting of disease progression. this hypothesis was confirmed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month study in subjects with ttr-fap, in which those subjects receiving tafamidis had better neurologic outcomes compared with those receiving placebo. in order to improve the understanding of the natural history of ttr-cm, a longitudinal, observational clinical study of 29subjects with either the v122i genetic variant (11subjects) or wild-type (18subjects) associated ttr-cm (transthyretin amyloid cardiac study; tracs) was undertaken. a follow-up phase2 open-label interventional study (study fx1b-201) demonstrated ttr stabilization in subjects with v122i and wild-type ttr-cm and an acceptable safety profile following 12months of tafamidis 20mg given once daily. study b3461031 was designed to evaluate the effect of tafamidis on the corrected qt (qtc) interval inhealthy volunteers. the primary objective was to characterize the effect of a supra-therapeutic tafamidis concentration (~20 g/ml) on the qtc interval relative to placebo in healthy volunteers. a supra-therapeutic, single, 400 mg oral-dose of tafamidis solution in healthy volunteers demonstrated a lack of an effect on qtc interval prolongation. single doses of moxifloxacin 400 mg established that the study had adequate sensitivity to detect increases in the qtcinterval. objectives and endpoints: the objective of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety,and tolerability of tafamidis in subjects with transthyretin cardiomyopathy the primary objective is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an oral dose of 20mg or 80mg tafamidis meglumine soft gel capsules in comparison to placebo and given once daily, in addition to standard of care,for 30 months in subjects diagnosed with either a ttr variant or wild-type ttr-cm. the study is designed to assess the potential forbenefit from treatment with tafamidis relative toplacebo based on all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations (including heart failure, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and stroke as well as other cardiovascular-related events). primary analysis: the primary analysis uses ahierarchical combination applying the method of finkelstein-schoenfeld (finkelstein 1999)16 toall-causemortality and frequencyof cardiovascular-relatedhospitalizations,which is defined as the number of times a subject is hospitalized (ie, admitted to a hospital) for cardiovascular-related morbidity. secondary endpoints: analysis of the following key secondary endpoints will follow an alpha conserving strategy: 1. change from baseline to month 30 on the distance walked during the 6-minute walk test (6mwt)(appendix 4). 2. change from baseline to month 30 on the kansas city cardiomyopathy questionnaire overall summary score (kccq-os)(appendix1.1). the following additional secondary endpoints will be analyzed without an alpha conserving strategy for multiple comparisons: 1. cardiovascular-related mortality, 2. frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization, 3. all-cause mortality, 4. ttr stabilization at month 1. study design: this is an international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 3-"
" prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in men worldwide, and the sixth most common cause of cancer death in men. most prostate cancers depend on the male sex hormone testosterone to grow. early prostate cancer is treated by surgically removing the prostate gland, or by treating the prostate with radiation. if the cancer comes back or is more advanced, most men with prostate cancer will be treated by castration, or lowering the amount of testosterone that their body makes. this is done either by surgery to remove the testicles, or by taking drugs that stop the testicles from making testosterone. however, about 10-20% of men will have prostate cancer that continues to get worse, even with surgery or drugs to lower testosterone. this type of prostate cancer is called castration-resistant prostate cancer. enzalutamide is an investigational medicine that reduces the activity of testosterone in the body. it does this by decreasing the ability of testosterone to connect with androgen receptors, which are proteins on the surface of cells in the body that sense testosterone. at the time of this study, enzalutamide was approved in the united states of america (usa) and the european union (eu) for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (also called metastatic prostate cancer). however, there were no drugs approved to stop castration-resistant prostate cancer from beginning to spread to other parts of the body when this study was conducted. the patients enrolled in this trial were men with a certain type of prostate cancer, called castration-resistant with no evidence of metastasis. this means that their prostate cancer was getting worse, even with surgery or drugs to lower testosterone, but had not yet started to spread to other parts of the body. the researchers in this study wanted to ask:  do patients taking enzalutamide treatment go longer without their prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body, or dying from any cause? researchers were also interested in learning more about the safety of enzalutamide. they monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were taking enzalutamide, and for 30 days after they stopped taking enzalutamide.

Patients who choose not to continue in the open-label period will discontinue treatment and return for safety follow-up within approximately 30daysafter last dose. Sites must have all open-label day1 visits completed within 16 weeks after IRB (Institutional Review Board)/EC (Ethics Committee) approval of this protocol amendment. Patientswho will receive any other treatment for prostate cancer after unblinding will not be eligible for an open label enzalutamideextension. The complete details for the conduct of the open-label period are provided in Supplement1:Open-Label Period. DOUBLE-BLIND The completed double-blind protocol remains unchanged. The double-blind period has concluded and the open-label period is ongoing. Methods:This multinational, phase3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety study will evaluate enzalutamide (formerly MDV3100) versus placebo in approximately 1440men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). All patients will be required to maintain androgen deprivation during the study, either using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist/antagonist or having a history of bilateral orchiectomy. Central randomization to enzalutamide or placebo treatments (2:1) will be stratified by the following factors:  PSA doubling time (<6months vs 6months);  Baseline use of a bone-targeting agent (yes vs no). Enzalutamide (160mg/day) will be administered as four 40-mg soft gelatin capsules by mouth once daily with or without food. Placebo capsules, identical in appearance to enzalutamide capsules, will be administered to patients in the control arm in the same manner. Study drug administration should continue until radiographic progression as specified in the protocol. Investigators are discouraged from obtaining PSA assessments at their local laboratories during the study and from discontinuing a patients study drug treatment due to PSA rise alone. Initiation of new therapy for prostate cancer (with the exception of cytotoxic chemotherapy, androgen receptor inhibitors, and investigational agents) at the time of radiographic progression will not mandate discontinuation of study drug if the investigator considers continuing study drug to be beneficial. Patients will continue with Enzalutamide after radiographic progression, if continuation of treatment with Enzalutamide seems clinically beneficial. Initiation of bisphosphonates or other bone-targeting agents for bone health, such as denosumab, is not allowed during the study prior to developm"
" what is advanced renal cell cancer? cancer occurs when cells in the body divide without control and can spread to other parts of the body. renal cell cancer is the most common form of kidney cancer. it starts in the lining of the small tubes inside the kidney that help clean and filter blood. advanced renal cell cancer is when the disease has progressed to stage iv and has spread to other parts of the body. what are axitinib and mk-3475? axitinib, pronounced ak-sih-tih-nib, also called inlyta, is a tablet, taken by mouth twice a day. researchers think axitinib may help patients with advanced renal cell cancer by stopping the body from making a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or vegf. cancer cells make extra amounts of some proteins including vegf when growing. the extra vegf tells the surrounding cells to make new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. blood vessels are tiny tubes that allow blood to move around and provide nutrients and oxygen to all the parts of the body. mk-3475, also called pembrolizumab or keytruda, is an intravenous (iv) treatment that researchers believe may help patients with cancer. mk-3475 works by sticking to a protein called anti-programmed cell death protein, which prevents it from protecting cancer cells from the bodys immune system. researchers think taking both axitinib and mk-3475 may help patients with advanced renal cell cancer, as they work in different ways. however, first they needed to know more about the safety of taking both these treatments at the same time. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this study was to and learn how safe the combination of axitinib mk-3475 were for patients with advanced renal cell cancer and figure out the best dose to use in future studies. researchers wanted to know:  how safe was the combination of axitinib and mk-3475 for participants with advanced renal cell cancer?  what medical problems did participants have during the study? ","protocol summary background and rationale: renal cell carcinoma (rcc) is the most common kidney cancer and constitutes about 3% of all malignant tumors in adults.1 until 2005, interferon-alpha (ifn-) and high-dose interleukin (il)-2 therapies were the standard of care for patients with advanced rcc (arcc), albeit with modest efficacy. since then, development and approval of multiple vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) inhibitors have significantly improved the outcomes of arcc patients. these agents include the vegf receptor (vegfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib and sorafenib; the mtor inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus, and the anti-vegf monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. however, despitethe substantial improvement of patient outcomes with these agents, durable and complete response in arcc patents are uncommon; the majority of patients will eventually develop resistance exhibit disease progression while on therapy and succumb to death due to metastatic disease. there is a strong rationale for considering immunotherapy in arcc patients. cytokine-based immunotherapy, especially high-dose il-2, exhibited durable responses in some arcc patients. there are anecdotal reports of spontaneous remissions in arcc patients with evidence of antigen-specific lymphocyte infiltration in tumor tissues.2 these reports have generated considerable interest in immunotherapeutic approaches in the treatment of arcc patients, especially with advent of immune-check point inhibitors such as anti-pd1 and anti-pd l1 antibodies in recent years. upregulation of programmed death-1 (pd-1) receptor on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (tils), and its ligand pd-l1 on tumors, are associated with more aggressive disease and poor prognosis.3,4 blocking the pd-1/pd-l1 interaction is a novel immunotherapeutic approach for arcc which has shown single-agent efficacy in patients whose disease has progressed following vegf pathway inhibitor therapy.6,7 bms-936558, also named nivolumab, is a fully humanized anti-pd-1 antibody (bristol-myers squibb) that has shown anti-tumor activity in 296patients with solid cancers.5. among these 296 patients, 33patients had arcc and were heavily pretreated before nivolumab therapy. nivolumab was given at a starting dose of 1mg/kg and then expanded to 10 mg/kg. the objective response rate (orr) was 27%(9/33) and another 9patients (27%) had stable disease at the 24-week follow-up time-point. five patients had durable response longer than 1 year.5 mk-3475 is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mab) of the igg4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between pd-1 and its ligands, pd-l1 and pd-l2. it is proposed in this study that the addition of the pd-1 inhibitor, mk-3475, to the vegf pathway inhibitor axitinib may provide additional clinical benefit compared to treatment with axitinib alone. antitumor activity of single agent axitinib in treatment-nave patients with clear cell arcc was assessed against sorafenib in a randomized, open-label, phase3 trial. although the study did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in median pfs (mpfs) between patients treated with axitinibor sorafenib, axitinib was associated with a longer mpfs value {median pfs of 10.1 months (95% ci 7.2,12.1) with axitinib vs. 6.5months mpfs observed with axitinibin this study was similar to that demonstrated earlier in phase3 clinical trials with other approved vegf tkis in the first-line treatment of arcc patients.8 toxicities in this clinical trial were manageable and similar to those observed in clinical trials with axitinib in pre-treated arcc patients.9 this data supports the testing of mk-3475in combination with axitinib in the first-line treatment of arcc patients. the primary objective of this study will be to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination regimen in previously untreated arcc patients. secondary objectives of this study will include the assessment of objective response rate (orr) and duration of response (dr); progression-free survival (pfs); overall survival (os) up to five years. in addition, secondary objectives will also include pharmacokinetics (pk) of axitinib and mk-3475 when administered in combination and the effect of mk-3475 on the pk of axitinib and translational component. specifically, assessments in tumor and/or blood will include characterization of drug target pathways (eg, pd-l1), and gene expression profiles. once the tolerability of the combination has been confirmed, apreliminary assessment of its antitumor activity will be conducted in an expansion cohort of arcc patients in the first-line treatment setting. study objectives: primary objective  to assess the safety and tolerability of axitinib in combination with mk-3475 in patients with previously untreated advanced rcc in order to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (mtd) and select the recommended p"
" the purpose of this research study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of pf-05280586 to currently approved and marketed rituximab for treatment of low tumor burden follicular lymphoma (also called ltb-fl). ltb-fl is a type of non- hodgkins lymphoma (nhl). nhl is a type of cancer which starts in your lymphatic system (the disease fighting system). ltb-fl is not as aggressive and has a better prognosis (the likely outcome) than other types of nhl. one of the most common treatments for ltb-fl is with a medication called rituximab (also called rituxan or mabthera). rituximab is given as a monotherapy for ltb-fl. monotherapy means one medicine given without other medicines at the same time. rituximab works by attaching to a protein called cd20. cd20 sits on the surface of b lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). when rituximab binds to the cd20 protein it causes the b lymphocytes, including the cancerous ones, to die. rituximab is a biologic medicine. biologics can be made up of sugars, proteins, genetic material, human or non-human cells, and tissues (or groups of cells). rituximab is a good first-line treatment option for ltb-fl as per treatment guidelines like the national comprehension cancer network (nccn) guidelines. pf-05280586 is another biologic medicine. pf-05280586 was made to be like rituxan or mabthera. it was designed to have a similar structure and work in the same way that rituxan or mabthera do. this type of medicine is known as a biosimilar. pf-05280586 was the investigational medicine in this study. an investigational medicine is one that is not approved for sale in any country. the table on the next page shows the differences between rituximab (the biologic) and pf-05280586, (the medicine tested to see if it was a biosimilar to rituximab) in this study. wwwhhhaaattt hhhaaappppppeeennneeeddd ddduuurrriiinnnggg ttthhheee ssstttuuudddyyy???

was pf-05280586 as effective as rituximab? researchers wanted to compare whether pf-05280586 was as effective as rituximab for patients with ltb-fl. in this study, patients received either pf-05280586 or rituximab in an infusion once per week for 4 weeks. patients were checked to see if they had a complete response or a partial response to the treatment. a complete response is when there is no evidence of cancer after treatment. a partial response is when the cancer has improved after treatment. at the week 26 visit, 148 patients (76%, or 148 of 196 patients) who were in the pf-05280586 group had a complete or partial response to treatment. 140 patients (71%, or 140 of 198 patients) who were in the rituximab group had a complete or partial response to treatment at the week 26 visit. the amount of patients who had a complete or partial response at week 26 was comparable between the 2 groups. based on these results, the researchers have concluded that the results are not likely the result of chance. was the safety of taking pf-05280586 comparable to rituximab? patients were given a variety of different tests, such as physical exams by doctors, ecgs (a test to see how well your heart is working), collection of information (such as medical problems the patient was experiencing during the study), vital signs, and blood and urine tests (see below picture). based on the data collected from these tests, getting infusions of pf-05280586 once per week for 4 weeks had comparable safety to rituximab for patients with ltb-fl. this does not mean that everyone in this study had these results. other studies may produce different results, as well. these are just some of the main findings of the study, and more information may be available at the websites listed at the end of this summary. what medical problems did patients have during the study? the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. 190 out of 393 patients who received at least one dose of study medicine (either pf-05280586, or rituximab) in this study had at least 1 non-serious medical problem. a non-serious medical problem means that it is not life-threatening, does not cause lasting problems, or does not need hospital care. 97 patients (49%, or 97 out of 197 patients) in the rituximab treatment group had at least 1 non-serious medical problem. 93 patients (47%, or 93 out of 196 patients) in the pf-5280586 treatment group had at least 1 non-serious medical problem. between the 2 treatment groups, the medical problems were comparable in type and how often they occurred. they were also comparable to the known medical problems which can be caused by rituximab. the most common non-serious medical problems reported by participants in this study are listed on the next page. were there any serious medical problems? a medical problem is considered serious when it is either life-threatening or causes death, causes lasting problems, is considered medically important by the study doctor, or needs hospital care. 32 patients (8%, or 32 out of 393 patients) had serious medical problems. a total of 15 patients in the rituximab group had a serious medical problem. 17 patients in the pf-05280586 group had a serious medical problem. the most common serious medical problem experienced in both treatment groups was infection. 4 patients (2%, or 4 out of 196 patients) in the pf-05280586 group and 3 patients (2%, or 3 out of 197 patients) had an infection. 2 patients died during the study because their cancer got worse (known as disease progression). 1 patient was in the pf-05280586 group and 1 patient was in the rituximab group. both deaths occurred more than 4 weeks after the study ended. the deaths were considered by researchers to not be related to study treatment. where can i learn more about this study?

Rituximab is  approved for two broad indications: musculoskeletal and connective  tissue diseases and B-cell malignancies. Rituximab is an effective  therapy for the treatment of patients with CD-20 positive, B-cell  malignancies.1,2 Rituxan is the commercially available product in  the United States and will be referred to as rituximab-US; MabThera  is the commercially available product in the European Union and will  be referred to as rituximab-EU. In Japan the commercially available  product is Rituxan . Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody comprised of a human  IgG1K Fc region and a murine variable region that binds specifically  to human CD20. Rituximab contains 2 heavy (H) chains, each  comprising 451 amino acids and 2 kappa light (L) chains each  comprising of 213 amino acids, which are disulfide-bonded to form a  4-chain molecule (H2L2). Rituximab-Pfizer has the same primary amino acid sequence as the commercially available rituximab  product. The term biosimilar refers to a biologic drug that is developed to be  highly similar to an existing licensed reference biologic. Biosimilars  are intended to treat the same diseases as the reference biologic using  the same dose and treatment regimen. Unlike generic versions of  chemically-synthesized small molecule therapies, biosimilars are not  structurally identical to their reference biologic. This is due to the  purity, characteristics, and activity of a specific biologic being  dependent on and sensitive to changes in the process by which it was  manufactured. Therefore, the aim is to create a product with no  clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the reference biologic in terms of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls  (CMC), purity, potency, pharmacokinetics (PK), safety,  immunogenicity, and efficacy. The PK of rituximab-Pfizer, rituximab-EU and rituximab-US were  compared in a Phase 1/2 study conducted in patients with rheumatoid  arthritis (Protocol B3281001). The results showed that the 90%  confidence intervals (CIs) for the test-to-reference ratios of the  maximum serum concentration (Cmax), area under the  concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last  quantifiable time point (AUCT), and AUC from time zero  extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-) were within the pre-specified  window of 80.00% to 125.00% for the comparisons of  rituximab-Pfizer to rituximab-EU and rituximab-US, and for the  comparison of rituximab-EU to rituximab-US, demonstrating the PK  similarity of the 3 products. The study results also showed that the  safety and immunogenicity profiles and CD-19 positive B-cell  reductions were comparable across rituximab-Pfizer, rituximab-EU,  and rituximab-US. Because of the similarity between rituximab-US  and rituximab-EU, only rituximab-EU will be used as a comparator in  the current study. The demonstration of similarity in efficacy between a biosimilar and  the innovator product is an essential component of a clinical trial  program that collectively provides the evidence of biosimilarity. The  current study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and  immunogenicity of rituximab-Pfizer versus rituximab-EU in patients  with CD20-positive, low tumor burden follicular lymphoma  (LTB-FL) in the first-line treatment setting. While rituximab  monotherapy in the first line setting is not an approved indication, it  is an acceptable treatment option in low tumor burden follicular  lymphoma. 4,5 Using rituximab monotherapy allows the assessment of  biosimilarity without the potentially confounding factors that would  be introduced by combining rituximab with chemotherapy in more  advanced stage patients; this is particularly important for the  evaluation of comparative immunogenicity.  Throughout this clinical trial protocol, PF-05280586 is referred to as  rituximab-Pfizer; however, biosimilarity has not yet been established  and is not claimed. Likewise, the general term rituximab is  sometimes used for convenience when discussing the 2 blinded study treatments but is not a claim of biosimilarity. Biosimilarity will be  supported by analytical, non-clinical, clinical PK, pharmacodynamic  (PD), safety and efficacy studies. Objectives and  Endpoints: Primary Objective  To compare the efficacy of rituximab-Pfizer to rituximab-EU  when administered as a first-line treatment to patients with  CD20-positive, low tumor burden follicular lymphoma  (LTB-FL). Secondary Objectives  To evaluate the safety of rituximab-Pfizer and rituximab-EU.  To evaluate the population pharmacokinetics of  rituximab-Pfizer and rituximab-EU"
" duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is a disease that damages muscles, causing muscle weakness and loss of the ability to walk. dmd is most common in boys. domagrozumab is an experimental medicine studied for dmd. domagrozumab has not been approved for use outside of research studies. the main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of domagrozumab in boys with dmd. researchers wanted to answer these questions:  what medical problems did boys have during the study?  did boys who received domagrozumab have an improvement in functioning after 49 weeks of treatment, compared to boys who received placebo? a placebo looks just like the medicine, but doesnt have any medicine in it. to see if boys had an improvement in functioning, researchers used a test called the 4 stair climb. they measured how long it took the boys to go up stairs and then compared the results between the boys who received domagrozumab and those who received placebo. ","protocol summary background and rationale the investigational product pf-06252616, a humanized anti-myostatin (gdf-8) monoclonal antibody that neutralizes myostatin (gdf-8) is in development for the treatment of duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) to preserve and/or improve muscle function. other potential indications for pf-06252616include other muscular dystrophies, muscle frailty conditions such as cancer cachexia and sarcopenia and rehabilitation of muscle strength. the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics (pd) of pf-06252616 have been demonstrated in healthy adults following administration of either single ascending intravenous (iv) or a subcutaneous (sc) dose(s) and, subsequently, repeat iv doses in adult healthy subjects. dmd is the most frequently inherited neuromuscular disease, and predominantly affects boys. it is an x-linked muscular dystrophy caused by a mutation at xp21in the gene coding for the protein dystrophin (bushby et al, 2010; manzur et al, 2008)4,12 which is absent from the muscle of boys with dmd. dmd is the most severe of all muscular dystrophies and is characterized by skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration. most boys lose the ability to walk between the ages of 10and 14(lamperti & moggio, 2010).11 progressive cardiac problems manifest in the second decade. death occurs in the late teens or early twenties (manzur et al, 2008).12 protocol b5161002 is a first-in-patient study with pf-06252616. this study will provide the initial clinical assessment of the safety, efficacy, pk and pd of pf-06252616 following repeat iv doses in ambulatory boys with dmd. objectives and endpoints primary safety and efficacy  to determine the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending repeat iv doses of pf-06252616 in ambulatory boys with dmd. safety will be based on incidence of abnormal and clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examinations, weight, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ecg), left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef)by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (mri)with gadolinium or echocardiogram (if cardiac mri is not available at the site), livermri, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) (bone mineral density), x-ray (bone age) and columbia suicide severity rating scale(c-ssrs)parameters by week49. cardiac mri with gadolinium is the preferred method for cardiac imaging. if the subject has a contraindication to gadolinium, cardiac mri without gadolinium will be acceptable. echocardiogram may be substituted if it is not possible to perform cardiac mri (if cardiac mriis not available at the site).  to demonstrate the efficacy of treatment with iv doses of pf-06252616 based on an observed mean change from baseline on function (4stair climb) as compared to placebo following 49weeks of treatment. secondary  to characterize the effects of pf-06252616 on muscle strength and other functional assessments (forced vital capacity[fvc], northstar ambulatory assessment [nsaa], range of motion[rom], performance of upper limb[pul], six minute walk distance [6mwd]) compared to placebo.  to evaluate the pd activity of pf-06252616 based on the percent change of muscle volumeas measured on mrifrom baseline as compared to placebo.  to evaluate the pd profile of pf-06252616 based on gdf-8 (myostatin) modulation in blood.  to characterize the pk profile of pf-06252616.  to evaluate the immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies [ada] and neutralizing antibodies [nab]) of pf-06252616.  to characterize the long-term effects following approximately 2-years of treatment with pf-06252616 on functional assessments compared to historical control.  to characterize the effects of pf-06252616 on muscle strength and functional assessments compared to placeboin a subset of subjects who may demonstrate a rapid disease declineand with relatively low variabilityover a one-year period. exploratory  to evaluate biomarkers(lean body mass [lbm] bydxa, muscle quality by mri, quantification of blood biomarkers)that may be informative in demonstrating the pharmacologic effect of pf-06252616.  to evaluate biomarkers that may be informative for monitoring hepatic liver injuryin the setting of dystrophic muscle.  to evaluate the functional health status(pediatric data outcomes collection instrument [podci] questionnaire).  to evaluate long term safety of pf-06252616 in subjects treated for >1 year.  to evaluate duration of treatment response following withdrawal and/or continuation of treatment for >1 year. study design this is a phase2 randomized, 2-period, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pk and pd of pf-06252616 administered to ambulatory boys diagnosed with dmd. three iv infused dose levels (5, 20 and 40mg/kg) administered every 28days will be investigated in a within subject dose escalating fashion. approximately 105 eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3sequence groups and receive investigational product for"
" what is locally advanced or metastatic cancer? the term metastatic refers to cancer that has spread from the part of the body where it started to another part of the body. the term locally advanced refers to cancer that has spread from the part of the body where it started to a nearby part of the body. this study included participants with locally advanced or metastatic cancer that started in the head and neck, skin (melanoma), liver, kidney, lung, bladder, stomach, or cervix (lower part of womb). what are pf-04518600 and utomilumab? pf-04518600 is a type of protein known as an antibody, which may stimulate the immune system. pf-04518600 may produce an immune response against tumors by stimulating a molecule on immune cells called ox40. an immune response against tumor cells may help slow tumor growth by causing tumor cells to die. pf-04518600 is an investigational treatment, which means that it is still being studied and has not been approved for use outside of research studies. this study was the first time that pf-04518600 was given to people. utomilumab is another antibody treatment that may stimulate the immune system. utomilumab may produce an immune response against tumors by stimulating a molecule on immune cells called 4-ibb. utomilumab is an investigational treatment. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety of pf-04518600 in people with locally advanced or metastatic cancer. information about the safety of pf-04518600 was also needed so that researchers could determine the correct dose to use in the second part of this study and in future studies. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: Immunotherapy offers the opportunity to not only stop tumor growth, but also decrease the  rate of tumor recurrence. 1 By activating and expanding tumor-associated antigen T cells, it  may be possible to enhance tumor immunity. However, T cell activation is not mediated by antigen stimulation alone. Instead, co-stimulatory receptors are required. OX40 (CD134)  and 4-1BB (CD137) are co-stimulatory receptors that act on antigen stimulated T cells but  not native T cells. 2,3 OX40 plays a key role in T cell survival, proliferation, and activation.  Upon OX40 ligand (also known as OX40L, CD252 or TNFSF4 [tumor necrosis factor  (ligand) superfamily, member 4]) binding, OX40 signaling upregulates anti-apoptotic  molecules including B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-xL, and survivin, 4 and increases  interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, and interferon gamma (IFN-) cytokine secretion. Similarly,  activation of 4-1BB signaling leads to an upregulation of pro-survival factors Bfl-1 and  Bcl-xL, down-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bim, increased T cell proliferation and  differentiation into T memory cells. 5 PF-04518600 is a fully human Immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for human OX40 (CD134). By binding to OX40 on activated tumor  infiltrating T cells, PF-04518600 may reverse T cells anergic state, and enhance tumor  immunity.  Utomilumab (PF-05082566) is a fully human IgG2 agonist monoclonal antibody specific for  human 4-1BB. The safety and tolerability of utomilumab is currently being evaluated in a  First-in-Patient Phase 1 study as a single agent and in combination with rituximab (Study B1641001, IND 109,154).6 Utomilumab has been well tolerated (thus far up to 10 mg/kg)  when administered as a single agent every 4 weeks (Q4W). The safety profile of utomilumab either as single agent or in combination with rituximab was manageable without occurrence  of treatment related life threatening (>Grade 4) adverse events (AEs).  In this clinical study, PF-04518600 as a monotherapy (Part A), and PF-04518600 in  combination with utomilumab (Part B) will be evaluated for the treatment of adult patients  with select locally advanced or metastatic cancers who are unresponsive to current available  therapies, or for whom no standard therapy is available. Study Design: This is a Phase 1, open label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety,  pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of PF-04518600 monotherapy in Part A, and  PF-04518600 in combination with utomilumab in Part B. Each part includes a dose  escalation phase, and a dose expansion phase. A maximum of approximately 210 patients  are expected to be enrolled into the study. All patients will complete up to 4 weeks of screening. Following the initial dose(s),  treatment with investigational product will continue until disease progression by immune-related response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (irRECIST), patient refusal, unacceptable toxicity occurs, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. Patients will be  allowed to stay on study, if the treating physician feels that it is in the patients best interest  in the case of radiological progression, and the absence of clear clinical progression (see Section 5.4.6 Treatment after Initial Evidence of Radiological Disease Progression). A  follow-up visit approximately 4 weeks after the last dose for adverse event (AE) and serious  AE (SAE) collection will be conducted. Late immune related responses will be evaluated up  to 98 days after the first dose(s) of Cycle 1. Because atypical tumor responses after growth  of pre-existing lesions or appearance of new lesions have been observed with immune  checkpoint inhibitors, study B0601002 will assess tumor response based on both response  evaluation criteria in solid tumor (RECIST) and Immune-related Response Criteria Derived  From RECIST v1.1 (irRECIST). Survival data will also be collected (see Section  5.4.6 Treatment after Initial Evidence of Radiological Progression, Section 6.3 Follow-up  Visit, Section 7.4 Tumor Response Assessments, and Appendix 6). The time on study can  vary depending on the observed toxicity and potential benefit an individual patient derives.  Its estimated that patients will remain on treatment for approximately 12-18 weeks, making  total study duration approximately 20-26 weeks (exclusive of 2 year survival follow-up).  Actual duration can be longer, if a patient derives benefit from study treatment. "
" non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) is the most common type of lung cancer. in some patients with nsclc, their cancer cells have changes (mutations) in the gene that makes a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor, or egfr. these mutations in egfr help stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply. researchers are looking for better treatments for patients with nsclc whose cancer cells have mutations in the egfr gene. pf-06747775 is an investigational medicine being studied to treat patients with nsclc with specific mutations (changes) in the egfr gene. an investigational drug is one that is currently not approved for sale in this country. researchers think that pf-06747775 works by blocking the activity of enzymes called tyrosine kinases that help cells grow. these enzymes may be too active or found at high levels in some types of cancer cells. by blocking the activity of these proteins, pf-06747775 can help limit the growth and spread of cancer cells. pf-06747775 was provided as tablets and taken by mouth once every day. this study was divided into 2 parts, or phases. the main purpose of the first phase of the study (phase 1) was to determine the best dose of pf-06747775 to use in the second phase of the study (phase 1b/2). to do this, the researchers asked:  what dose-limiting toxicities, or dlts, did patients have when taking pf-06747775? dlts are certain medical problems caused by taking pf-06747775 which require the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the medicine temporarily or permanently. the main purposes of the phase 1b/2 part of the study were to see if the patients cancer improved with pf-06747775 treatment, and to find the best dose of pf-06747775 to use with another cancer drug called palbociclib (ibrance). to do this, researchers asked these questions:  what dose-limiting toxicities, or dlts, did patients have when taking pf-06747775 with palbociclib?  what percentage of all patients in the study had their nsclc get better when taking pf-06747775? to answer this, the researchers looked to see if the patients tumors got smaller after taking the study medications.  how long do patients live when taking pf-06747775 before their nsclc got worse, or before dying of any cause? to answer this, the researchers measured the median time between starting the study medicines and the patients nsclc getting worse, or dying of any cause. the median time was the time point where half (50%) of the patients taking pf-06747775 had their nsclc get worse, or they had passed away from any cause. researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of pf-06747775. they monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY: INDICATION Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor  (EGFR) activating mutations (exon 19 deletion [del 19] or point mutation in exon  21 [L858R]).  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Epidermal growth factor receptor -mutant (EGFRm) NSCLC accounts for approximately  20% of NSCLC, representing a conservative estimate of 100,000 to 200,000 newly diagnosed cases per year globally. Two frequent and mutually exclusive primary mutations,  EGFR L858R and EGFR del 19, together accounting for approximately 85% of all cases, are  oncogenic drivers, and are strong predictive biomarkers of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase  inhibitors (TKIs). First-line treatment of EGFRm NSCLC patients with currently approved  EGFR TKIs provides excellent response rates and disease control for 11 to 14 months, but  patients invariably become resistant to these therapies and their disease progresses. For  patients with resistant tumors, approximately 60% harbor a second mutation in the EGFR  kinase domain (T790M), concurrently with the primary activating mutation. Thus, in efforts  to discover and develop improved EGFR TKIs, these double-mutant EGFR variants,  L858R/T790M and del 19/T790M, are key drug development targets in addressing  resistance, and sparing wild type (WT) EGFR is essential in preventing dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). PF-06747775 is a molecularly-targeted, rationally-designed, third generation EGFR TKI. In  recombinant enzyme assays and cellular assays, PF-06747775 is a highly potent and  irreversible inhibitor against the EGFR double-mutants (L858R/T790M and del 19/T790M) and single-mutants (L858R and del 19) and a weak inhibitor of WT EGFR. This inhibitory potency on mutant targets is paralleled by subsequent inhibition of the EGFR downstream  signaling axis, induction of apoptosis, and viable cell decline. In xenograft mouse models,  PF-06747775 demonstrates tumor growth inhibition and regression at well-tolerated doses in  disease-relevant models driven by EGFR double- and single-mutants. The antitumor efficacy of PF-06747775 is dose-dependent and shows a strong correlation with pharmacodynamic  (PD) inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation, inhibition of EGFR-mediated downstream  signaling, and induction of apoptosis. Using multiple in vitro approaches to assess non-target  kinase selectivity, PF-06747775 demonstrates the potential for high kinase selectivity, with  only 7 out of 273 (3%) tested non-target kinases showing the potential for inhibition by PF-06747775 at pharmacologically-relevant concentrations.  Additionally, the compound has a preclinical safety profile which suggests that  PF-06747775 can achieve an adequate therapeutic index based on the predicted efficacious  concentration (Ceff ) in patients. There remains an unmet medical need to develop EGFR TKI agents that effectively target  both the single activating mutations of del 19 and L858R, and the secondary resistance  mutation T790M, while sparing WT EGFR. Drugs active against the resistance mutation  will enable molecularly-targeted therapy with a more favorable toxicity profile than the current standard of cytotoxic chemotherapy platinum-based doublets. Furthermore, by  having a wide margin of selectivity favoring the EGFR mutants versus WT EGFR,  PF-06747775 is likely to be positioned to improve patient outcomes from an efficacy and  safety perspective. Palbociclib is a first-in-class CDK4/6 inhibitor conditionally approved in the United States  (US) for use in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant for advanced estrogen-receptor (ER)  positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. By  inhibiting CDK4/6 and subsequently downstream signaling through Rb protein that controls  the cell cycle, palbociclib prevents actively proliferating cells from completing the cell  division cycle, resulting in an arrest of tumor growth. EGFR TKIs inhibit phosphorylation of  EGFR, thereby inhibiting downstream cell signaling through the EGFR axis including AKT,  MEK/ERK, and transcription of cell cycle related genes such as cyclin D1 and E2F target  genes, resulting in the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation in EGFRdependent tumor cells. It is hypothesized that combination of the EGFR TKI PF-06747775  with palbociclib in EGFRm NSCLC could further impede tumor growth with increased  efficacy over the EGFR TKI alone. This potential increased efficacy may reflect better  inhibition of cell cycle progression with the combination. In vitro and in vivo assessment of the combination of PF-06747775 and palbociclib showed  increased efficacy over PF-06747775 alone in NSCLC models representing the first-line  EGFRm and second-line T790M-resistant patient populations. Mechanistic studies suggest  the combination effect predominantly relies on the addition of the pro-apoptotic effect of  PF-06747775 plus the anti-proliferative effect of both agents. These studies support clinical  testing of the PF-06747775 palbociclib combination for increased clinical benefit in EGFRm NSCLC Separately, recent evidence has shown that tumors require suppression of the host immune  system for continued growth and spread. The development of agents targeting the interaction of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligands has shown promise in the treatment of various cancers including  NSCLC. Substantial clinical activity was observed with anti-PD-1 antibodies nivolumab and  pembrolizumab, with an objective response rate of 15% and 20%, respectively, and long  duration of response in unselected heavily pretreated NSCLC patients.  Although immune checkpoint inhibitors, including avelumab, are demonstrating promising  activity in a variety of tumor types, there continues to be a need for new therapies. Tumordirected therapies such as chemotherapy and targeted agents improve tumor antigenicity by inducing cell death, providing the basis for potential synergy with immune checkpoint  inhibitors.  Recent studies in genetically-engineered mouse models demonstrate that EGFR mutations  promote tumorigenesis not only by stimulating tumor cell proliferation, but also by suppressing antitumor immunity, in part by upregulating PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating T cells  through a non-cell-autonomous mechanism."
" lung cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the lungs. non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) is the most common type of lung cancer. avastinis one medicine that is currently used to treat nsclc. avastin may stop cancer tumors from growing. pf-06439535 is a medicine that is made to be similar to avastin, and is being studied as a possible treatment for many cancers. in this specific study, avastin was studied for nsclc. the purpose of making a medicine similar to avastin is to give patients another treatment option. a committee of doctors have reviewed the data and recommended that pf-06439535 be approved for use in europe. pf-06439535 is still being tested and has not been approved for use in other regions. the main goal of this study was to determine if pf-06439535 works in a similar way to avastin. patients in this study also received 2 other medicines for nsclc, called paclitaxel and carboplatin. researchers wanted to know:  at week 19 of the study, how many patients who took pf-06439535 would have a reduction in tumor size (tumor getting smaller), compared to patients who took avastin? ","protocol summary introduction pf-06439535 (bevacizumab-pfizer) is being developed as a potential biosimilar to bevacizumab. avastin (bevacizumab) is the commercially available bevacizumab product in the united states, european union (bevacizumab-eu), japan, and other regions. bevacizumab is a recombinant humanizedimmunoglobulin g1(igg1)monoclonal antibody (mab) that is composed of 2heavy chains and 2light chains, which are linked by disulfide bonds. it has an approximate molecular weight of 149kd and is produced in mammalian chinese hamster ovary cells. bevacizumab is a mab that binds to and inhibits the biological activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) in in vitro and in vivoassay systems. bevacizumab-pfizer has the same primary amino acid sequence as avastin and will be developed to be highly similar (biosimilar) to avastin as sourced from the european union (bevacizumab-eu) and from the united states (bevacizumab-us). study objectives and endpoints primary objective  the primary objective of this study is to compare the confirmed objective response rate (orr) by week19 following treatment with bevacizumab-pfizer in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin to bevacizumab-eu plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients who have not receivedprevious treatment for advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). secondary objectives  to evaluate the safety of bevacizumab-pfizer plus paclitaxel and carboplatin and bevacizumab-eu plus paclitaxel and carboplatin;  to evaluate secondary measures of tumor control;  to evaluate the population pharmacokinetics (pk) of bevacizumab-pfizer and bevacizumab-eu;  to evaluate the immunogenicity of bevacizumab-pfizer and bevacizumab-eu. primary endpoint  objective response rate (orr), evaluating the best response achieved by week19and subsequently confirmed by 6weeks thereafter, in accordance with response evaluations criteria in solid tumors (recist) version 1.1. secondary endpoints  safety characterized by type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness, and relationship to study therapyof adverse events, including cardiotoxicity and infusion-related reactions, and laboratory abnormalities at 1 yearfrom randomization  duration of response (dor), 1 year progression-free survival (pfs) rate and 1-year survival ratefrom randomization;  peak and trough bevacizumab-pfizer and bevacizumab-eu concentrations at selected cycles up to 1 yearfrom randomization  incidence of anti-drug (bevacizumab) antibodies (ada), including neutralizing antibodies (nab)up to 1 yearfrom randomization study design this is a multinational, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab-pfizer plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus bevacizumab-eu plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in first-line treatment for patients with advanced (unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) non-squamous nsclc. approximately 355patients will be enrolled in each treatment arm for a total of approximately 710patients at over 300centers. patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive eithertreatment ofbevacizumab-pfizer plus paclitaxel and carboplatin or bevacizumab-eu plus paclitaxel and carboplatinfor at least 4and no more than 6cycles, followed by the assigned blinded bevacizumab monotherapy. randomization will be stratified by region (according to the location of the drug depot supplying the site), sex (male/female) and smoking history (never/ever). patients will participate in the study for approximately 13months. this includes about 1month of screening and at least 1 year fortreatment and follow-up. actual length of participation for individual patients will depend upon the actual duration of treatment. minimum expected participation is approximately 1 year unless shorter due to death, withdrawal of consent, or early termination of the trial. see figure1for details. figure1. study schema *assigned bevacizumab monotherapy: following completion of at least 4 and no more than 6cycles of chemotherapy   final protocol amendment 3, 10 june 2016 by local approved laboratories, and the results must be reviewed and confirmed as negative for mutations prior to randomization. 3. physical examination: includeshead, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, neck, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, abdomen, musculoskeletal, neurological systems, and weight. height will be recorded at screening only. genitourinary examinationis only required if directed by signs or symptoms. 4. brief physical examination:performed as directed by signs and symptoms on day1(pre-dose) of each cycleafter screening. 5. vital signs:temperature should be taken using the same method throughout the study. blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate should be taken with the patient in the supine or sitting positionafter the patient has been resting quietly for at least 5minutes and prior to dosing on dosing days. weight should be taken at"
" acute myeloid leukemia (or aml), myelodysplastic syndrome (or mds), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (or cmml) are types of blood cancers that usually affect patients over the age of 40. these cancers are caused by too many immature white blood cells being made in the bone marrow. this reduces the ability of the body to make normal blood cells such as white blood cells (that fight off infections), red blood cells (that deliver oxygen to muscles and organs), and platelets (that help blood clot). the treatment options for aml, mds, and cmml are limited if the patient cant receive intensive chemotherapy (strong medications) because of other medical problems. researchers are looking for new medicines that can help patients with aml, mds, and cmml live longer without their cancer rapidly getting worse. glasdegib (now approved under the brand name daurismo in the united states) was the investigational medicine tested in this study, and it was not yet approved at the beginning of this study. glasdegib was developed to help reduce growth of cancerous stem cells in the bone marrow. cancer stem cells are cells that self-regenerate and contribute to tumor growth. these cancer stem cells may be one of the reasons why some cancers return after chemotherapy treatment. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the use of glasdegib in patients with aml, mds, and cmml, when given in combination with a chemotherapy medicine called azacitidine. azacitidine is the standard treatment that is usually given for patients with aml, mds, and cmml. this study was divided into 2 parts, or phases. researchers asked these questions:  phase 1: what medical problems did patients have during treatment with glasdegib and azacitidine?  phase 2: how many patients would achieve complete remission when taking glasdegib and azacitidine? in this study, complete remission or complete response meant that the patients no longer had any evidence of aml, mds, or cmml. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Glasdegib (PF-04449913) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of the Sonic Hedgehog (Hh)  pathway which is currently under development for the treatment of hematologic  malignancies.  This multi-center open-label Phase 1b study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy,  pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of glasdegib when combined with  azacitidine in patients with previously untreated Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome  (MDS), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia  (CMML). This clinical study includes two components: (a) a safety lead-in cohort (LIC) and  (b) an expansion phase with two cohorts. Indication Safety Lead-In Cohort (LIC) Previously untreated adult patients with Intermediate-2 or High-Risk MDS according to the  International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), AML with 20%-30% blasts and  multi-lineage dysplasia according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification,  and CMML. Expansion (a) Previously untreated adult patients with Intermediate, High, or Very High risk MDS  according to the International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R) and (b) AML  patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (according to WHO  2016 classification). Background and Rationale Disease Overview MDS is a heterogeneous group of myeloid disorders defined by a common set of features, of  which the most prominent is morphologic bone marrow and peripheral blood dysplasia  associated with inefficient hematopoiesis, the development of peripheral cytopenias and an  increased risk of transformation to AML. The incidence of MDS is around 45 per  100,000 individuals annually worldwide, with the prevalence increasing with age. The French-American-British (FAB) classification system established in 1982 was the first  approach allowing for a reliable diagnosis of a disease group that had previously been termed  pre-leukemia. In 2001 the WHO classification of hematopoietic neoplasms was introduced,  subsequently updated in 2008, and most recently in 2016. The principal modifications with  respect to the FAB classification were to consider patients with 20% or more bone marrow or  peripheral blood blasts as having AML, and to remove the CMML subtype and place it in a  newly created category termed Myelodysplastic/ Myeloproliferative Neoplasms  (MDS/MPN). The standard of care treatment of higher risk (Intermediate-2 and High-Risk) MDS and AML  with 20-30% bone marrow (BM) blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, has previously been  focused on intensive chemotherapy using anthracycline and cytarabine (Ara-C) combinations  but this approach has led to lower complete response rates and a shorter response duration as  compared to treatment outcomes in patients with de-novo AML 30% BM blasts. In response to this unmet medical need, several multi-center randomized studies comparing hypomethylating agent (HMA) treatment to supportive care have been conducted and  demonstrated delayed progression to AML, with prolongation of median progression-free  survival (PFS) of between 3 to 8 months as compared with best supportive therapy.  Azacitidine was approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for  the treatment of all MDS subtypes according to the FAB classification. This approval was  based on the overall response rate defined as Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response  (PR) observed in the randomized CALGB-9221 study. The overall response rate (CR + PR)  was 15.7% in the azacitidine treatment group, and there were no responders in the control  group. In 2009, results from the international AZA-001 trial, phase 3 randomized trial comparing  azacitidine to conventional care regimens (CCR) in patients with Intermediate-2 or High Risk  MDS, showed that the median overall survival (OS) was significantly prolonged in the  azacitidine arm as compared with the CCR arm (24.5 months for azacitidine vs. 15.0 months  for CCR; hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.430.77) despite a low CR  rate (17% in the azacitidine arm vs 8% in the CCR arm). Based on this observed survival  benefit, azacitidine was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adults  who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and have Intermediate-2 or  High-Risk MDS, CMML with 10-29% marrow blasts and lacking a myeloproliferative  component, and AML with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia according to WHO  2008. AML is a genetically heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterized by multiple  mutations and epigenetic dysregulation at the time of diagnosis that evolves with treatment,  resulting in treatment resistance, disease relapse, and reduced survival. It is estimated that  there will be 21,380 new cases and 10,500 deaths from AML in the United States in 2017. Existing standards of care such as cytarabine + anthracycline (7+3), or hypomethylating  agents like decitabine and azacitidine, can induce CR in 5-70% of patients; however,  remissions are not durable and disease relapse occurs in up to 60% of patients. For AML patients unable to receive intensive chemotherapy, existing standard treatments like Low  Dose Cytarabine (LDAC) are associated with response rates <20% and median OS times of  5-6.5 months. Hypomethylating agents, azacitidine and decitabine, although not approved in  the US specifically for AML, have shown improved OS vs LDAC in AML patients who were  not candidates for intensive chemotherapy. Reducing the incidence of disease progression to  prolong survival remains the highest unmet medical need in the treatment of AML patients.  In 2015, results from the international randomized phase 3 AZA-AML trial comparing  azacitidine to CCRs in patients aged 65 years with newly diagnosed or secondary AML  with >30% bone marrow blasts demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in median   "
" non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) is the most common type of lung cancer. in some patients with nsclc, their cancer cells have changes (mutations) in the gene that makes a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor, or egfr. these mutations in egfr help stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply. researchers are looking for better treatments for patients with nsclc whose cancer cells have mutations in the egfr gene. dacomitinib (vizimpro) is a medicine that has been approved in the united states, japan and european union as treatment for patients with nsclc. at the time of this study, dacomitinib was not yet approved for treatment of patients with nsclc. dacomitinib works by blocking the activity of a group of proteins called the human epidermal growth factor receptor (her) family (including egfr [also known as her1], her2, and her4). these are proteins on the surface of cells that can stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply. by blocking the activity of these proteins dacomitinib may be able to help limit the growth and spread of cancer cells. dacomitinib is given as a tablet once a day to be taken by mouth. the purpose of this study was to provide continued access to dacomitinib for patients who participated in other dacomitinib studies in japan and would be deemed to derive benefit from continued dacomitinib treatment. researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of dacomitinib. they monitored the patients for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study. ","protocol summary indication: this treatment extension study will enroll patients with advanced cancer who are receiving single-agent dacomitinib in a prior study in japan, and have the potential to derive clinical benefit without unacceptable toxicityfrom continued single-agent dacomitinib treatment. background and rationale: dacomitinib is an orally available, selective adenosine triphosphate (atp)-competitive irreversible small-molecule inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor (her,erbb) family receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) including the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr, her-1), her-2receptor (erbb2), and her-4(erbb4) receptor andtheir oncogenic variants (ie, egfr exon 19deletion, egfr l858r point mutation, and egfr t790m mutation). dacomitinibis being developedgloballyin locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer(nsclc)after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. in the course of development, phase2and 3studies are being conducted in severalnsclc treatment settings. complete information for this compound may be found in the single reference safety document (srsd), which for this study is the investigators brochure(ib). indications of activity have been seen in a number of dacomitinib clinical trials. this protocol permits continued access to dacomitinib for patients who participated in other dacomitinib monotherapy treatment protocols and have the potential to derive clinical benefit without unacceptable toxicity from continued dacomitinib treatment. thistreatment access protocol is only open to patients in japan. patients will follow a schedule of visits and data collection that permits continued safety monitoring. objectives: primary objective:  to allow access to dacomitinib for patients who received dacomitinib on a prior study in japan and who have the potential to derive continued clinical benefit from single-agent dacomitinib treatment without unacceptable toxicitybased upon the investigators judgment. secondary objective:  to monitor the specific long-term safety and tolerability of single-agent dacomitinib endpoints: adverse events as assessed bynational cancer institutecommon terminologycriteria for adverse events version 4.0(nci ctcae.v4.0). study design: this is a multi-center, open-label, treatment extension study open in japan only. eligible patients include those with advanced cancer who received and tolerated single-agent dacomitinib in a prior clinical study and have the potential to derive continued clinical benefit based on investigator judgment. patients enrolled in this extension study may continue to receive dacomitinib starting at the current dose level in the prior study. dose reductions and re-escalations are allowed based on tolerability. patients may continue to be treated with dacomitinib on this protocol as long as there is evidence of clinical benefit in the judgment of the investigator. adverse events will be graded according to nci ctcae v4.0, and monitored according to the frequency outlined in the safety review plan. study treatment: patients will receive continuous daily dosing of dacomitinib at a dose of 45 mg, 30mg, or 15mg. the starting dose of dacomitinib on this treatment extension study will be the patients endingdose from the prior study. patients may continue single-agent dacomitinib treatment on this treatment extension study as long as there is reasonable evidence of clinical benefit without unacceptable toxicityper investigator judgment and with agreement of the sponsor(see section 6.1 patient withdrawal). statistical methods: due to the nature of this study, the number of patients to be enrolled is not predetermined. no statistical methods will be employed to test a specific hypothesis in this study. only descriptive summariesof safetywill be provided, and no inferential analyses are planned. schedule of activities the schedule of activities table provides details of the protocol visits and procedures. refer to the study procedures and assessments sections of the protocol for additional information on certain specificprocedures and assessments required for compliance with the protocol. the investigator may schedule visits (unplanned visits),inaddition to those listed on the schedule of activities, in order to conduct evaluations or assessments required to protect the well-being of the patient. table1. schedule of activities protocol activity screening cycle 1 cycles2and beyond end of follow-up (28days day 1 treatment visit9 prior to every every study entry) 8weeks 6months informed consent1 x patient history x registration x laboratory hematology2 x x x blood chemistry3 x x x urinalysis4 x pregnancy test5 x x x safety/disease assessments tumor assessments6 x adadverse event x x x x x assessments7concomitant medication8 x x x x x study treatment as per dosing regimen in original dacomitinib protocol 1. informed consent: all patients must sign an informed consent document prior to any study-related procedures that are "

" hemophilia is a disease that is inherited, which means it runs in families, and it mainly affects boys and men. people with hemophilia have problems with their blood not clotting. after an injury, someone with hemophilia will bruise more easily and, if cut, will bleed for longer. sometimes the bleeding can happen inside the body and this internal bleeding can be serious as it can cause damage. doctors prescribe medicines called factor replacement therapy to help the blood to clot in people with hemophilia. these treatments work by replacing the clotting factors that are missing from the blood of a person with hemophilia. clotting factors are proteins in the blood that help stop bleeding after an injury as well as prevent bleeding from happening. there are many different clotting factors in the blood and these are numbered using roman numerals. people with hemophilia b are missing factor ix (9) (fix). this means fix is given to people with hemophilia b. factor replacement therapy is given by infusion where the medicine is prepared in a syringe and then injected or pushed through a patients skin into a vein. a vein is a tube that carries blood around the body. other treatments are also available that can be given by injection, or a shot, subcutaneously, to prevent or reduce the number of bleeding episodes (also known as bleeds). subcutaneously means the injection is given just underneath the skin. fidanacogene elaparvovec is a new kind of treatment being studied for hemophilia. it works in a different way to other treatments to help blood to clot. fidanacogene elaparvovec is a novel recombinant adeno-associated virus (aav), which in nature causes no disease, to deliver the human factor ix (hfix) gene to the liver cells where fix is normally made. for this study, researchers were interested in learning about the safety and kinetics (movement through the body) of a single dose of fidanacogene elaparvovec where it may help to prevent or reduce the number of bleeding episodes. "," 1.1. Synopsis Protocol Title:Gene therapy, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study of PF-06838435 (SPK-9001) [adeno-associated viral vector with human factor IX gene] in subjects with hemophilia B. Rationale Adeno-associated virus vector(AAV)vectors have been administered in more than 100 gene transfer clinical trials for a wide range of indications, including several studies for hemophilia B, and have demonstrated a good safetyprofile1, 2. Importantly, data from a recent clinical study of AAV8 gene transfer to participants with severe hemophilia B, sponsored by St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital University College London (SJ-UCL), demonstrated that asingle peripheral intravenous (IV) infusion of the self-complementary AAV8-LP1-hFIXco resulted in sustained and long-term circulating vector-derived factor IX (FIX:C) activity levels of 2-12%, which were sufficient to improve the bleeding phenotype and reduce the use of regular prophylactic factor IX (FIX) infusions, in some cases completely eliminating them3. The previous Sponsor also conducted a study of anAAV8 vector for hemophilia B (AAV8-hFIX19, IND 15149)study was recently conducted. In that trial, the vector was well tolerated and all three dosed participants experienced initial increases in vector-derived FIX:C activity levels. For two of the three participants, expression was short-lived (~2-4months), likely due to an immune response to some vector component, despite the initiation of an immunosuppressive regimen; for the third participant, expression was longer-lived (~18months), but trended inexorably downward despite the immunosuppressive therapy. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and kinetics of a single IVinfusion of PF-06838435 in hemophilia B participants with 2 International Units (IU)/dL [2%] endogenous factor IX levels. Dose Rationale PF-06838435 is an AAV vector designed to drive expression of the human coagulation factor IX (hFIX) transgene and raise circulating levels of endogenous FIX. PF-06838435 is comprised of a bioengineered AAV capsid, AAV-Spark100, and a codon-optimized expression cassette (hFIX39-Padua). AAV-Spark100 is a novel capsid engineered from a naturally occurring AAV serotype, which shows a strong hepatotropic profile in mice and non-human primates (NHPs), comparable to AAV8. The cassette (hFIX39-Padua) encodes the hFIX variant that has higher specific activity than the wild-type (WT) FIX due to the substitution of an arginine for a leucine at amino acid position 338 (R338L). CCI The non-clinical study in NHPs infused with a similar vector, AAV-Spark100-hFIX19- Padua, resulted in therapeutic steady-state vector-derived FIX activity levels without safety concerns. PF-06838435 and AAV-Spark100-hFIX19-Padua share the same regulatory Thus, the data with AAV-Spark100-hFIX19-Padua in NHPs can be used to predict the vector-derived FIX:C activity levels with PF-06838435 in this study. An ongoing clinical trial (NCT#01687608) evaluating the safety and efficacy of a self- complementary AAV8 vector encoding the high specific activity hFIX variant, hFIX-Padua (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, BAX-335), is currently being conducted in participants with hemophilia B. Preliminary clinical data of six participants infused at three different dose levels (2x1011, 1x1012, and 3x1012 vg/kg) achieving vector-derived FIX:C activity levels from <1%to~60% withno safety concerns were presented at the recent European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) meeting. Based on Pfizers knowledge of their results, there have been no thrombotic events observed in the Baxter trial to date. Thus, these data further support the safety of the dose levels being investigated in this study. This study will investigate up to three dose levels (5x1011, 1x1012, and 2x1012 vg/kg). Safety of these dose levels is supported by previous human clinical trials of AAV2 and AAV8 vectors encoding hFIX, as well as the NHP studies with AAV-Spark100-hFIX19-Padua and with PF-06838435, in which dose levels up to 5x1012 vg/kg were infused without evidence of adverse effects. This dose level is ~10-fold higher than the proposed starting clinical dose level of 5x1011 vg/kg in this study. Study Design This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled, dose-escalation and multi- center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and kinetics of a single IV infusion of PF-06838435 in hemophilia B participants with 2 IU/dL [2%] endogenous factor IX [FIX] levels. Up to 30 evaluable participants will be dosed with a single IVinfusion of PF-06838435 at one of three different dose levels. Participants will provide informed consent and then undergo screening assessments up to 6(2) weeks prior to PF-06838435 infusion on the Dosing Day (Day 0). All dosed participants will undergo safety observation for a total of 52 (2) weeks after PF-06838435 infusion (see the Schedule of Activities). Participants who complete 52 (2) weeks (End-of- Study) will be encouraged to enroll in an extension study evaluating the long-term safety of PF-06838435 for up to an additional 5 years. Originally, up to 5 evaluable participants may be dosed in each dose level. An initial dose level may be expanded up to 10 evaluable participants if at least 3 out of 5 participants achieve detectable steady-state vector-derived FIX activity levels above 5%. If, after the above initial dose-level expansion, at least 6 out of 10 participants achieve detectable steady- state vector-derived FIX activity levels above 5%, then further dose-level expansion of up to 10 additional evaluable participants would be allowed (a total of up to twenty evaluable participants at the starting dose level of 5x1011 vg/kg). The administration of PF-06838435 to the first two participants in the starting dose level will be staggered by at least 2 weeks to ensure safety. Additionally, at least eight weeks of safety data from at least 3 out of 5"
" the kidneys are organs in the body that help get rid of waste while also controlling the amount of water in the body by producing urine. renal cell carcinoma (rcc) is a type of kidney cancer that starts in the small tubes of the kidney. it is the most common kind of kidney cancer found in adults. kidney cancer is called advanced when it has grown or spread outside of the kidney. treatment for advanced rcc may include all or some of the following:  surgery to remove a part of the kidney or the whole kidney  radiation therapy, in which beams of intense energy are used to kill cancer cells  treatment with chemical substances (chemotherapy)  treatment that uses the bodys own immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys own natural defense against cancer (immunotherapy/biotherapy/biologic therapy) avelumab is approved in certain countries for the treatment of some cancers and is a drug that stimulates the bodys own defense system against cancer. axitinib is approved in certain countries for the treatment of advanced rcc for certain patients after one prior treatment. at the time of this study, avelumab in combination with axitinib was not approved for treatment of patients with advanced rcc. recently, avelumab in combination with axitinib has been approved in some countries as treatment for patients with advanced rcc. the purpose of this study was to find the highest dose level tested of avelumab and axitinib taken together that is considered safe enough (less than 2 dose limiting toxicities [dlts] in 6 patients) to test in advanced rcc patients in further studies. this is called the maximum tolerated dose. researchers wanted to know:  what is the maximum tolerated dose level of avelumab in combination with axitinib? dose limiting toxicities, dlts, are certain medical problems caused by taking a medicine or medicines which require the patient to lower the dose they are taking or to stop taking the medicine (permanently or temporarily). dlts can be many things, and may include, for example, fever with a low count of white blood cells. ","protocol summary background and rationale: renal cell carcinoma (rcc) is the most common kidney cancer and constitutes about 3% of all malignant tumors in adults.1 rcc is often first detected at an advanced stage, with 25-30% of patients having metastatic disease at diagnosis. until 2005, interferon-alpha (ifn-) and high-dose interleukin (il)-2 therapies were the standards of care for patients with advanced rcc (arcc), albeit with modest efficacy. since then, development and approval of multiple vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) inhibitors have significantly improved the outcomes of arcc patients. these agents include the vegf receptor (vegfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib and sorafenib; the mtor inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus; and the anti-vegf monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. however, durable and complete responses in arcc patients are uncommon; the majority of patients will eventually develop resistance, exhibit disease progression while on therapy, and succumb to death due to metastatic disease. response rates for previously treated arcc patients are in the 15-25%range, and median survival after diagnosis is under 1 year.1 there is a strong rationale for considering immunotherapy in arcc patients. cytokine-based immunotherapy, especially high-dose il-2, exhibited durable responses in some arcc patients. there are anecdotal reports of spontaneous remissions in arcc patients with evidence of antigen-specific lymphocyte infiltration in tumor tissues.16 these reports have generated considerable interest in immunotherapeutic approaches in the treatment of arcc patients, especially with advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (pd-1) and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1) monoclonal antibodies in recent years. upregulation of pd-1 receptor on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (tils), and its ligand pd-l1on tumors, are associated with more aggressive disease and poor prognosis.17,18 monoclonal antibodies (mab) that block the pd-1/pd-l1interaction are novel immunotherapeutic approaches for arcc, which have shown single-agent efficacy in patients whose disease has progressed following vegf pathway inhibitor therapy.19,20 nivolumab, a high-affinity, fully human anti-pd-1mab has shown durable tumor responses with objective response rate (orr) of about 20% and median progression-free survival (pfs) of about 16weeks in heavily pretreated arcc patients.21,22 when nivolumab was combined with a vegf tki (sunitinib or pazopanib), it demonstrated more pronounced anti-tumor response. amin et al reported the data from combinations of sunitinib or pazopanib with nivolumab at the american society of clinical oncology (asco) 2014 annual meeting.23 the pazopanib plus nivolumab arm was discontinued due to safety issues; however, sunitinib (50mg, 4weeks on/2 weeks off) was successfully combined with nivolumab 5mg/kg every 3weeks (q3w), and dose expansion was subsequently completed in previously untreated arcc patients. orr was 52% (17/33) for nivolumab in combination with sunitinib, and 45% (9/20) for nivolumab in combination with pazopanib. median duration of response (dr) was 37.1weeks (95% confidence interval [ci]: 18.1-80.0+), and mpdl3280a, another human mab that targets pd-l1, has shown orr of 13% and stable disease (sd) 24 weeks in 32% of patients with previously treated rcc when administered as a single agent. results from the combination of bevacizumab 15mg/kg q3w with mpdl3280a (20mg/kg) were presented by mcdermott et al at the european society for medical oncology (esmo) 2014 annual meeting.24 data were limited, but in previously untreated arcc patients, there were 4of 10 (40%) patients who had partial responses (prs). five additional patients had a best response of sd, and almost all (9out of 10) responding patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis. these data, although preliminary, demonstrate the benefit of combining an anti-pd-1 or pd-l1antibody with an anti-vegf pathway agent in arcc patients. the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (ctla-4), showed acceptable safety and encouraging antitumor activity in patients with metastatic rcc. patients were randomized to receive nivolumab 3mg/kg + ipilimumab 1mg/kg (arm n3+ i1) or nivolumab 1mg/kg+ipilimumab 3mg/kg (arm n1 + i3) intravenously (iv) q3w for 4 doses, then nivolumab 3mg/kg iv q2w until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. confirmed objective response (or) was observed in 9/21patients in arm n3+ i1 and in 11/23patients in arm n1+ i3. the median pfs was 36.6 weeks and 38.3weeks in arm n3+ i1and in arm n1+ i3, respectively.25 avelumab (msb0010718c) is a fully human mab of the immunoglobulin (ig) g1isotype that specifically targets and blocks pd-l1.26 avelumab is the proposed international nonproprietary name (i"
" osteoarthritis is a common joint condition that affects millions of people around the world. osteoarthritis happens when the cartilage in the joint wears down through overuse, injury or patient age. cartilage is the rubbery material that acts as padding, or a cushion, between the bones in the joint and stops the bones from rubbing together. when the cartilage wears down, the joint can become stiff and painful. osteoarthritis often affects the knees and hips but can be seen in other joints. researchers did this study to compare the long-term pain relief and joint safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (also known as nsaids) with tanezumab in patients with osteoarthritis of the hips or knees. joint safety is a measure of how well the bone and joint are doing and whether there are any safety problems. doctors often prescribe nsaids like naproxen, celecoxib, or diclofenac to help patients with their osteoarthritis. tanezumab is an investigational drug, which means it is not approved for use in the countries where the patients in this study live. it is a new type of drug that is being studied to see if it may be able to help patients with osteoarthritis pain. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY  Background Tanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the actions of nerve growth  factor (NGF). The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor (NGFI) class may offer an important  breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the  treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions.  The completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies conducted to date have demonstrated that  tanezumab is efficacious and generally safe and well tolerated for the treatment of pain due  to osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain. In addition, completed Phase 1/2 studies suggest  tanezumab is also efficacious and generally safe for the treatment of neuropathic, visceral,  and cancer pain. In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Division of Analgesia, Anesthetic,  and Addiction Products (DAAAP) placed tanezumab (June/July 2010) and subsequently the  entire NGFI class (December 2010) on partial clinical hold due to adverse events initially  described by investigators as osteonecrosis that in some cases resulted in total joint  replacement. Pfizer voluntarily imposed the partial clinical hold on study conduct in all  countries. Extensive analyses of the reports of osteonecrosis and other total joint replacements were  conducted.1  On March 12, 2012, the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee reviewed these  results as well as those prepared by the FDA.2,3  The committee endorsed continued clinical  development of the NGFI class of compounds with additional measures to minimize the risk  and further protect subject safety. On August 28, 2012, the FDA lifted the partial clinical  hold on tanezumab allowing the resumption of clinical studies for osteoarthritis and all other  chronic pain conditions.  Using recommendations from discussions with European agencies [United Kingdoms  Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Germanys Paul Ehrlich  Institute (PEI) and Spains Agency on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (AEMPS)]  as well as the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee and interactions with FDA, risk mitigation  measures were developed and are incorporated in the design and objectives of the current  study.  The FDA placed another partial clinical hold on the tanezumab clinical development program  as well as all anti-NGF antibody studies in 2012 due to concerns about adverse changes in  the sympathetic nervous system of mature animals. Only studies in patients with cancer pain  were allowed to continue.  In animal studies in rats and non-human primates, tanezumab treatment for up to 6 months,  with doses producing greater systemic exposure than observed with clinical doses, was  associated with lower sympathetic ganglion volume and lower average size of  post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons when compared to control animals. All effects were  completely reversible following a dosing-free recovery period. In a separate cardiovascular function study in non-human primates, functional changes in the cardiovascular system  controlled by the sympathetic nervous system were not observed.  Although evidence of clinically important effects on the sympathetic nervous system have  not been identified in previously completed tanezumab studies, per agreement with the FDA,  this and other clinical studies of tanezumab will incorporate additional safety measures to  monitor for and manage subjects who may develop evidence of clinically important  sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to characterize the long-term joint safety risks of  tanezumab using a composite endpoint (includes adjudication outcomes of rapidly  progressive osteoarthritis (type-1 and type-2), subchondral insufficiency fracture (or  SPONK), primary osteonecrosis, or pathological fracture and 2) demonstrate the analgesic  superiority of tanezumab relative to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) administration of tanezumab at doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg  and 10 mg was shown to reduce pain and improve function in a dose-related manner in prior  Phase 3 studies of osteoarthritis. No further study of the tanezumab 10 mg dose will be  conducted in subjects with osteoarthritis as this dose did not provide any added efficacy  benefit over the 5 mg dose. However, the 5 mg dose is expected to provide added efficacy  benefit over the 2.5 mg dose. Tanezumab doses of 2.5 mg and 5 mg will be studied in this  protocol.  The 56-week duration of the study precludes the use of a placebo comparator and as such, an  active control has been included in the study design. To facilitate inclusion of an active  control group that will serve as a benchmark for evaluation of the long-term safety and  efficacy of tanezumab, subjects entering the current study must be receiving a stable dosing  regimen of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) therapy (naproxen,  celecoxib, diclofenac, aceclofenac, loxoprofen, ibuprofen, meloxicam, nabumetone, sulindac  or ketoprofen), be tolerating their NSAID regimen and be taking this medication regularly  during the 30-day period prior to the Screening visit. Subjects randomized to receive NSAID  in the current study will receive them at protocol specified doses [naproxen 500 mg twice a  day (BID), diclofenac extended release (ER) 75 mg BID or celecoxib 100 mg BID]. The  doses selected for the NSAID treatments being utilized in this study correspond to maximal  or near maximal labeled doses for the treatment of osteoarthritis.  The study will include a number of assessments to permit further characterization of the  pathophysiology of orthopedic events that may be observed during conduct of the study.  These assessments are described in the main body of the protocol. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Primary Objectives:  Characterize the long-term risk of joint safety events in subjects with osteoarthritis of  the knee or hip who receive tanezumab 2.5 mg or tanezumab 5 mg SC versus NSAID  treatment (naproxen 500 mg BID, celecoxib 100 mg BID, or diclofenac ER "
" chronic low back pain is pain in the lower back that lasts for 3 months for more. doctors can prescribe medicines to manage this pain, but these medicines may not work well for all patients, so researchers are looking for additional treatment options. tanezumab was evaluated in patients with chronic low back pain. tanezumab is not approved for use in patients. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about how tanezumab works to treat chronic low back pain symptoms. the researchers wanted to answer this question:  did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in chronic low back pain symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo? a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine.

The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor (NGFI) class may offer an important  breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the  treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions.  The completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies conducted to date have demonstrated that  tanezumab is efficacious and generally safe and well tolerated for the treatment of pain due  to osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain. In addition, completed Phase 1/2 studies suggest  tanezumab is also efficacious and generally safe for the treatment of neuropathic, visceral,  and cancer pain.  In 2010, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Division of  Analgesia, Anesthetic, and Addiction Products (DAAAP) placed tanezumab (June/July 2010)  and subsequently the entire Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor (NGFI) class (December 2010) on  partial clinical hold due to adverse events initially described by investigators as osteonecrosis  that in some cases resulted in total joint replacement. Pfizer voluntarily imposed the partial  clinical hold on study conduct in all countries. Extensive analyses of the reports of osteonecrosis and other total joint replacements were  conducted.1 On March 12, 2012, the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee reviewed these  results as well as those prepared by the FDA. 2,3 The committee endorsed continued clinical  development of the NGFI class of compounds with additional measures to minimize the risk  and further protect subject safety. On August 28, 2012, the FDA lifted the partial clinical  hold on tanezumab allowing the resumption of clinical studies for chronic low back pain,  osteoarthritis and all other chronic pain conditions.  Risk mitigation measures were developed using recommendations from discussions with  European agencies [United Kingdoms Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Germanys Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) and Spains Agency on Medicinal  Products and Medical Devices (AEMPS)] as well as the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee  and interactions with FDA and are incorporated in the design and objectives of this study.  The FDA placed another partial clinical hold on the tanezumab clinical development program  as well as all anti-NGF antibody studies in December 2012 due to concerns about adverse  changes in the sympathetic nervous system of mature animals. Only studies in patients with  cancer pain were allowed to continue.  In animal studies in rats and non-human primates, tanezumab treatment for up to 6 months,  with doses producing greater systemic exposure than observed with clinical doses, was  associated with lower sympathetic ganglion volume and lower average size of  post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons when compared to control animals. All effects were  completely reversible following a dosing-free recovery period. In a separate cardiovascular  function study in non-human primates, functional changes in the cardiovascular system  controlled by the sympathetic nervous system were not observed.  Although evidence of clinically important effects on the sympathetic nervous system have  not been identified in previously completed tanezumab studies, per agreement with the FDA,  this and other clinical studies of tanezumab will incorporate additional safety measures to  monitor for and manage subjects who may develop evidence of clinically important  sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.  This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose of tanezumab 5 mg and  10 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) seven times at 8-week intervals. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superior efficacy of tanezumab 10 mg and 5 mg  administered SC every 8 weeks compared to placebo at Week 16. The study will provide  additional experience with the tanezumab 5 mg and 10 mg doses which have been shown to  provide efficacy benefits with a favorable safety profile in a previous Phase 2 clinical trial.  In addition, the study will evaluate the long term safety profile of tanezumab treatment for  chronic low back pain compared to tramadol Prolonged Release (PR), a medication  commonly utilized for the treatment of chronic low back pain. In order to optimize the potential benefit-risk relationship, the study will be conducted in  subjects with moderate to severe chronic low back pain without comorbid symptomatic  osteoarthritis who have had inadequate pain relief or are unable to take most conventional  pharmacological treatment options for low back pain.  STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Primary Objective:  Demonstrate superior analgesic efficacy of tanezumab 10 mg and 5 mg administered  subcutaneously (SC) every 8 weeks compared to placebo at Week 16. Secondary Objectives:  Evaluate the long-term safety of tanezumab 10 mg and 5 mg SC administered every 8 weeks (7 administrations);  Estimate the long-term analgesic efficacy of tanezumab 10 mg and 5 mg SC  administered every 8 weeks (7 administrations) up to Week 56;  Compare the analgesic efficacy of tanezumab 10 mg SC administered every 8 weeks  relative to an active comparator (oral tramadol PR) at Week 16.  Primary Endpoint:  Change from Baseline to Week 16 in the daily average Low Back Pain Intensity (LBPI) score as measured by an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale for tanezumab vs  placebo. "
" this study was done to find out if an experimental vaccine might prevent meningococcal b disease. meningococcal disease is an infection that causes the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord to become swollen and inflamed. it is caused by a germ called meningococcus. there are different types of the meningococcal germ: types a, b, c, and y. the type b meningococcal germ causes more meningococcal disease than any other type of meningococcal germ. while the likelihood of getting meningococcal b disease is very low, children under the age of 4 years are more likely to get it than any other age group. vaccines are given to prevent people from getting infections, and they work by helping people to fight off germs. while there are vaccines available to prevent other types of meningococcal disease, there isnt one available worldwide to prevent meningococcal b disease. the vaccine given in this study is an injectable called bivalent rlp2086. this study tested bivalent rlp2086 to see if it will help people fight off the meningococcal b germ and provide protection (immunity) against the disease. this could only be done by testing the vaccine in healthy people who have never had an infection with meningococcal disease before. as this disease is most common in babies and toddlers, the vaccine was tested in this age group. this study was done to see if toddlers made immune system proteins, called antibodies, after receiving bivalent rlp2086. antibodies help the body to fight off diseases, in this case, group b meningococcal disease. researchers also wanted to see what side effects toddlers have after receiving bivalent rlp2086 compared to a pediatric hepatitis a virus (hav) vaccine. bivalent rlp2086 is being compared to hav because hav is already widely used and the side effects of hav are well known. ","protocol summary neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, adolescents, and young adults in developed countries. in particular, neisseria meningitidis serogroup b (mnb) is responsible for approximately two-thirds of the cases of observed meningococcal infections in europe, with a case-fatality rate of 6% to 8% from 1999 to 2006. australian national surveillance data show the peak incidence of disease in children aged 4 years or less, with a secondary peak in adolescents and young adults; approximately 85% of all cases are attributed to serogroup b disease. a recombinant, multicomponent mnb vaccine (bexsero) is licensed in europe, canada, australia, chile,and the united states. trumenba (bivalent recombinant lipoprotein 2086 vaccine[bivalent rlp2086]), developed by pfizer, is approved in the united states for use in individuals 10 through 25 years of age for active immunization to prevent invasive meningococcal disease (imd)caused by mnb. recommendations for mnb vaccinationare under considerationin various countries. however, to date, no broadly effective vaccine against mnb disease is available worldwide. general availability of a safe and immunogenic mnb vaccine remains an unmet medical need, and a successful vaccine will provide substantial improvement in prevention of meningococcal infection and a reduction in the burden of disease. bivalent rlp2086 is targeted to a conserved, surface-exposed lipoprotein, lipoprotein 2086 (lp2086), a meningococcal virulence factor that binds human factor h. n meningitidis serogroup b recombinant lipoprotein 2086 (rlp2086) has been expressed in escherichia coli and formulated in a bivalent vaccine composed of 1subfamily a strain and 1 subfamily b strain of rlp2086. this studywill describethe safety, tolerability,and immunogenicity of bivalent rlp2086 administered at 2 dose levels (60 g and 120 g) in 2 age strata (12 to <18 and 18 to <24months old), given in a month 0, 2, and 6schedule. the younger age stratum will be substratified into toddlers 12 to <15 and 15 to <18 months of age. within each age stratum, examination of the 120-g dose level will proceed only after the 60-g dose level is shown to be safe and tolerable in a sentinel cohort. this study will be conducted in 2 stages:  stage 1 includes visit 1 to visit 10.  stage 2 will assess the duration of the immune response to bivalent rlp2086; hence, only those subjects randomly assigned tobivalent rlp2086 (irrespective of dose level) will be eligible for stage 2. for eligible subjects, stage 2 commences at visit 11 (approximately 24months)and concludes at visit 13 (approximately 48months) after vaccination 3. bivalent rlp2086 has previously been studied in toddlers aged 18 to36 months using the earliervaccine formulation at doses up to 200 g. it has also been studied in children, adolescents,and adults with results in these populations that have demonstrated a satisfactory safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity profile. this study,with the final formulation of final protocol amendment 2, 19 april 2016 formulation of the vaccine in toddlers aged 18 to <24months and to provide dataabout the use of the vaccinein toddlers aged 12 to <18months. in addition,the duration of mnb-specific immune response, measured by serum bactericidal assayusing human complement (hsba),will be assessed for up to 4 years. analysis of the primary immunogenicity endpoints will includethe following:  proportions of subjects achieving an hsba titer  the lower limit of quantitation (lloq) 1month after the third vaccination, for each of the 4 primary mnb test strains in healthy toddlers aged 12 to <18 months at study entry.  proportions of subjects achieving an hsba titer  lloq 1 month after the third vaccination, for each of the 4 primary mnb test strains in healthy toddlers aged 18 to <24months at study entry. objectives primary immunogenicity objectives  to describe the immune response as measured by hsba performed with 4 primarymnb strains, 2 expressing an lp2086 subfamily a protein and 2 expressing an lp2086 subfamilyb protein, measured 1month after the third vaccination with bivalent rlp2086, in healthy toddlers aged 12 to <18 months at study entry.  to describe the immune response as measured by hsbaperformed with 4 primary mnb strains, 2 expressing an lp2086 subfamily a protein and 2 expressing an lp2086 subfamilyb protein, measured 1month after the thirdvaccination with bivalent rlp2086, in healthy toddlers aged 18 to <24 months at study entry. primary safety objective  to evaluate the safety profile of bivalent rlp2086 compared to a control (pediatric hepatitis a virus [hav] vaccine), as measured by local reactions, systemic events, adverse events (aes), serious adverse events (saes), newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions, medically attended events, and immediate aes in healthytoddlers 12 to <18 months and 18 to <24 months of age at study entry, and in both age strata combined. seco"
" juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia) is the most common type of arthritis in children. the term idiopathic means of unknown origin, and the term juvenile means that disease symptoms start before a person is 16 years old. this disease causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. jia is an autoimmune disease, which means that patients with jia have an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as the joints. jia can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked, so researchers are looking for new treatment options for polyarticular course jia. the study drug, tofacitinib, is an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been approved to treat adults with other types of arthritis. the body normally makes special proteins called cytokines that trigger activity in the immune system. in patients with jia, the body makes too many cytokines, which causes the immune system to become overactive. researchers think that the study drug works by lowering the amount of cytokines in the body, which helps to calm the activity of the immune system and decrease jia symptoms. the main purpose of this study was to find out if the study drug works to treat polyarticular course jia. some patients in this study also received placebo to find out if the study drug works in comparison with receiving no treatment at all. a placebo looks just like the medication, but doesnt have any medication in it. researchers wanted to know:  did the study drug work to prevent jia flares, improve jia symptoms, and ease or reduce overall disability compared to placebo? to answer this question, researchers looked at how many patients had disease flares by the end of the study after being treated with the study drug, compared to patients who received placebo. a flare is a sudden, temporary episode of pain and inflammation which is usually associated with tiredness, stiffness or joint swelling. researchers also looked at how many patients had 30%, 50%, and 70% improvement in their jia symptoms and if there was any change in their overall disability by asking the patients or their parents certain questions.

" breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women and there were over 2 million new cases world-wide in 2018. lots of different types of breast cancer exist, so a range of treatment options are needed. one treatment option for a specific type of advanced or metastatic breast cancer is ibrance (palbociclib). metastatic means that the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. ibrance (palbociclib) treatment was first approved for use in 2015. the researchers did this study so that they could offer patients with specific types of advanced breast cancer treatment with palbociclib if this treatment was not commercially approved or if patients were not eligible for clinical trials. this study ended when palbociclib became commercially available in participating countries and doctors were able to prescribe this treatment for their patients. "," 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Mechanism of Action/Indication Palbociclib is being developed for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive), HER2-negative(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative) breast cancer (BC). 1.2. Background and Rationale HR-positive/HER2-negativeBC is the most common subset of breast cancer.1 Most patients are diagnosed at an early stage and remain relapse-free if treated with a prolonged course of endocrine therapy. However, about onethird of patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative tumors, diagnosed initially with early stage disease, experience disease recurrence.2 The fundamental problem is that endocrine agents are only partially effective, typically causing cell cycle arrest and tumor dormancy rather than true cure. The role of estrogens in BC etiology and progression is well established. Modification of estrogen activity or synthesis represents the treatment of choice for postmenopausal women with HR-positiveadvanced breast cancer(ABC), particularly for those with slowly progressive disease and limited tumor-related symptoms.3 Studies of estrogen receptor (ER)-positiveBC cell lines indicate that estrogens4 and antiestrogens5 act on sensitive populations of cells in early to mid-G1 phase. G1/S transition is under the control of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)activated by specific complex formation with regulatory cyclins. Conversion of androgens to estrogens via aromatase enzyme action represents the main source of estrogens in postmenopausal women. Letrozole is an oral nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor that is approved worldwidefor the first line treatment of postmenopausal women with HR-positiveABC. Letrozole is administered orally in a continuous regimen at a 2.5-mg daily dose. In a multicenter Phase 3 study in patients with HR-positiveor HR-unknown ABC, letrozole was superior to tamoxifen for time to progression, time to treatment failure, overall objective response rate, and overall clinical benefit response.6 Multiple clinical studies have shown that letrozole is well tolerated. Palbociclibis an oral, selective, CDK 4/6 inhibitor that has been under investigationin clinical trials in multiple indications. Palbociclibinhibits cell proliferation by preventingcell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and has demonstrated antitumor activity in multiple preclinical models, includingER-positiveluminal breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, preclinical exploration using a BC cell line panel demonstratedthepresence of retinoblastoma (Rb)proteinand upregulation of cyclin D1 as well as decreased CDKN2A (p16) beingassociated with sensitivity to palbociclibas well as with its effects upon cell cycle and growth inhibition. These gene expression findings were also associated with the luminal subtype versus basal-like subtype ofBC. These results, together with published data ontheknowninteraction of estrogens and CDKs and the important role of cell cycle-related proteins in the genesis and maintenance of BC, led to the initiation of a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial (A5481003study; PALOMA-1) investigating the antitumor activity of palbociclib in combination with letrozole and single-agent letrozole in the first-line treatment of ER-positive/HER2-negativeABC patients. The final analysis of this study demonstrated aconsistent trend of clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS, the primary endpoint) and response based secondary endpoints,7 and the study results led to the approval of palbociclib for advanced BC by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 03 February 2015. 1.3. Palbociclib Oral palbociclibis a novel, first-in-class highly selective reversible inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 that is being studied for use in the treatment of cancer. The compound inhibits cell proliferation bypreventingprogression of the cell cycle from G1 into the S phase. 1.3.1. Preclinical Data Palbociclibinhibits purified CDK4-catalyzed phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein with an IC of less than 20 nm, and also tumor growth of several types of human xenograft 50 tumors (SF-295, MDA-MB-435, Colo-205, and others)grown in mice. Treatment of cultured tumor cells with palbociclibcauses growth arrest that is accompanied by the inhibition of specific retinoblastoma (Rb)phosphorylation by CDK4 or CDK6 on residues serine -780 and -795 of Rb. Consequently, the phosphorylation status of these sites serves as specific biomarkers of CDK4/6 inhibition by palbociclib. Estimated steady-state plasma concentrations of 1000 ng/mL resulted in 80% to 90% inhibition of phospho-Rb formation and 50% reduction of tumor growth. Reduction in phospho-Rb was rapidly reversible as plasma palbociclibconcentrations declined. Palbociclibwas tested in vitro on molecularly characterized human BC cell lines. Results from these experiments indicate that those cell lines that are more sensitive to palbociclib (IC <150 nm)have low levels of CDKN2A (p16) and high levels of Rb1, while resistant 50 cell lines show the opposite characteristics. Sensitive cell lines in this panel represent mostly the luminal ER-positivesubtype.8 The combination of palbocicliband aromatase inhibitors has not been tested in preclinical models. However, the combination of palbociclibwith tamoxifenhas recently been tested in vitro in ER-positivehuman BC cell lines indicating a synergistic interaction7 and provides a biologic rationale for evaluating the combination of palbociclib with antihormonal therapy in the clinic. Palbociclibpreclinical data indicate that it may be expected to haveadirect effect on growth arrest as well as potential secondary cytotoxic activity. 1.3.1.1. Ocular Preclinical Data Preliminary results from an ongoing 27-week repeat-dose oral toxicity study with palbociclib in rats identified a potential nonclinical safety finding related to the eye. Animals were"
" what are bone metastasis and metastatic bone pain? bone metastasis happens when cancer has spread from its original site to a bone. bone metastasis is the most common cause of cancer pain. metastatic bone pain happens when bone metastasis causes pain. metastatic bone pain is called mbp. what is tanezumab? tanezumab is a study medicine that has not been approved for use in patients. researchers think it could help lessen mbp. tanezumab was injected under the skin using a needle. what was the purpose of this study? researchers wanted to know: did tanezumab help participants lessen mbp? mbp can last for a long time and has a negative impact on well-being. while there are treatments for cancer pain, good control of mbp remains a challenge. patients who have mbp may need to take opioids. opioids are a kind of medicine for pain relief. they are given for pain that is rated as medium to worst. but, opioids alone may give poor control of mbp. researchers wanted to learn if tanezumab could lessen mbp in participants who were taking opioids. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Tanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the actions of nerve growth  factor (NGF). The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor (NGFI) class may offer an important  breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the  treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions. Information  regarding development of tanezumab in non-cancer patient populations can be found in the  tanezumab investigator brochure2 and in publically-available documents prepared for the  United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Arthritis Advisory Committee  meeting on March 12, 2012.3 4,5. The rationale for treatment of tanezumab in subjects with metastatic bone pain is provided by the rich innervation of bone by NGF-responsive neurons, 33 the pathologic elevation of NGF  and NGF-responsive neurons in bone metastases,33 results of preclinical studies  demonstrating metastatic bone pain efficacy with the murine precursor antibody to  tanezumab (MAb 911) and results of tanezumab clinical studies in musculoskeletal and  visceral pain conditions. The efficacy of tanezumab in subjects with painful bone metastasis has been evaluated in  Study A4091003, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group  study in subjects with cancer pain due to bone metastasis who were receiving background  treatment with opioids.  In addition, subjects who had been randomized and treated in  Study A4091003, and who wished to receive open-label tanezumab therapy, could roll over  to Study A4091029, a safety extension study designed to investigate the safety and  maintenance of effect of tanezumab 10 mg.   In Study A4091003, a total of 59 patients were  treated with either a single intravenous (IV) dose of tanezumab 10 mg (N=29) or placebo  (N=30). In Study A4091029, a total of 41 patients were treated with tanezumab 10 mg IV. A positive outcome for the primary efficacy endpoint for Study A4091003 (ie, a statistically significant change from Baseline to Week 6 in the daily average pain intensity) was not  achieved, although the mean decrease from Baseline in the tanezumab 10 mg IV treatment  group was numerically greater than that for the placebo treatment group. The change from  Study A4091003 Baseline in average pain was maintained up to Week 24 in A4091029 for  all subjects. For the 6 subjects who had received placebo in Study A4091003, the average  pain score in A4091029 subsequently worsened from Week 24 to Week 40 (back to the  Study A4091003 Baseline pain level). However for subjects who had received tanezumab  10 mg in Study A4091003, the improvement in average pain was further maintained to  Week 40 of Study A4091029. Although an acceptable safety profile was seen in the previous studies in this patient  population, efficacy has not yet been robustly demonstrated, hence further evaluation of  benefit-risk is required in Study A4091061. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Primary and Secondary Objectives The primary objective of Study A4091061 is to demonstrate superior analgesic efficacy of  tanezumab 20 mg subcutaneous (SC) versus matching placebo SC at Week 8 in subjects with  cancer pain predominantly due to bone metastasis receiving background opioid therapy.  The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of tanezumab 20 mg SC versus matching  placebo SC in subjects with cancer pain predominantly due to bone metastasis receiving  background opioid therapy. Primary and Secondary Endpoints The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline to Week 8 in the daily average  pain intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score in the index bone metastasis cancer pain  site. The secondary endpoints are as follows: Efficacy Measures  Change from Baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 16 and 24 in the daily average pain  intensity NRS score in the index bone metastasis cancer pain site.  Change from Baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 in the daily worst pain  intensity NRS score in the index bone metastasis cancer pain site.  Change from Baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 in the weekly average  pain intensity NRS score in non-index cancer pain sites.  Change from Baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 in the weekly worst pain  intensity NRS score in non-index cancer pain sites.  Change from Baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 in the daily average pain  intensity NRS score in the non-index visceral cancer pain sites.  Change from Baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 in the daily worst pain  intensity NRS score in the non-index visceral cancer pain sites."
" a neutrophil is a type of white blood cell that fights infections in the body. certain chemotherapy medicines that are used for treating cancer can cause the number of neutrophils in the body to be too low. this is known as chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, or cin. patients with cin are at increased risk for fever and serious infections. there are medicines that can be used to treat cin. one medicine that is used is called neulasta. neulasta may increase the number of neutrophils in the blood. this study was designed to study a new medicine being developed for cin. this medicine is called hsp-130 (pf-06881894), and it is similar to neulasta. the reason for studying hsp-130 is to give patients another treatment option. hsp-130 is still being studied and has not been approved for use outside of clinical studies. for this study, researchers were interested in learning how hsp-130 affects the body, when given as a single dose or as multiple doses. this information is important to help determine the right dose of hsp-130. the study was for women with breast cancer that had not spread to other parts of the body. it was divided into 2 parts. in the first part of the study, researchers wanted to answer this question:  what effect did hsp-130 have on the number of neutrophils in patients blood, if they were not getting chemotherapy? for the second part of the study, researchers wanted to answer this question:  how many days did patients have severely low neutrophil counts (neutropenia) during their first chemotherapy cycle?

" osteoarthritis is a common disease of the joints that can happen when the cartilage, a protective tissue that covers the joints, begins to wear down over time. this can cause symptoms such as pain, tenderness, stiffness, and loss of flexibility in the affected joints. it can also cause bone spurs, or extra pieces of bone, to form around the joints. there is currently no cure for osteoarthritis, but doctors can prescribe medicines to manage pain and other symptoms. these medicines may not work well for all patients with osteoarthritis, so researchers are looking for additional treatment options. tanezumab is being studied as a possible treatment option for osteoarthritis. because it is still being tested, tanezumab has not been approved for use in patients. the main purpose of this study was to learn more about how tanezumab works to treat osteoarthritis symptoms. the researchers wanted to answer this question:  did patients who received tanezumab have an improvement in osteoarthritis symptoms, compared to patients who received placebo? a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. a placebo is also known as a dummy drug. ","protocol summary background tanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the actions of nerve growth factor (ngf). the nerve growth factor inhibitor (ngfi) class may offer an important breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions.1 the completed phase2 and phase3 studies conducted to date have demonstrated that tanezumab is efficacious and generally safe and well tolerated for the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain. the primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superior efficacy of tanezumab 5 mg and 2.5 mg administered subcutaneously (sc) every 8 weeks versus placebo at week 24 in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. the 2.5mg dose was shown to provide efficacy benefits with a favorable safety profilewhen administered intravenouslyin previous phase3 clinical trials.the 5 mg dose is expected to provide added efficacy benefit over the 2.5 mg dosebased on data from previous studies. objectives and endpoints primary objective  demonstrate superior efficacy of tanezumab 5 mg and 2.5 mg administered subcutaneously (sc) every 8 weeks versus placebo at week 24. secondary objective  evaluate the safety of tanezumab 2.5 mg sc and 5mg sc. primary endpoints the co-primary efficacy endpoints are:  change from baseline to week 24 in the western ontario and mcmaster university osteoarthritis index(womac)pain subscale;  change from baseline to week 24 in the womac physical function subscale;  change from baseline to week 24 in the patients global assessment of osteoarthritis. secondary endpoints efficacy measures  womac pain subscalechange from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 32.  womac physical function subscale change from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 32.  patients global assessment of osteoarthritis (5 point likert scale) change from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,16, and 32.  outcome measures in rheumatology  osteoarthritis research society initiative (omeract-oarsi)responder index at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32.  cumulative distribution of percent change from baseline in the womac pain subscale score to week 16 and24 (endpoint for summary only).  treatment response: reduction in the womac pain subscale of30%, 50%, 70% and 90%, at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32.  treatment response: reduction in the womac physical functionsubscale of 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32.  cumulative distribution of percent change from baseline in the womac physical functionsubscale score to week16and24 (endpoint for summary only).  treatment response: improvement of 2 points in patients global assessment of osteoarthritis at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32.  average pain score in the index knee or hip change from baseline to weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32.  womac stiffness subscale change from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 32.  womac average score change from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32.  womac pain subscale item: pain when walking on a flat surface, change from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32.  womac pain subscale item: pain when going up or downstairs, change from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32.  work productivity and activity impairment questionnairefor osteoarthritis (wpai:oa) impairment scores change from baseline to weeks 8, 16 and 24.  eq-5d-5lhealth state utility and five items (mobility; self-care; usual activities; pain/discomfort; anxiety/depression) change from baseline to weeks 8, 16 and24.  patient reported treatment impact assessment-modified (mprti) at weeks 16 and 24.  health care resource utilization at baseline, and weeks 32and 48.  incidence and time to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy.  usage of rescue medication (incidence and number of days of use) during weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32.  usage of rescue medication (amount taken) during weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24. safety measures  adverse events.  standard safety assessments (safety laboratory testing [chemistry, hematology], sitting vital signs, electrocardiogram (ecg; 12-lead).  joint safety adjudicationoutcomes.  total joint replacements.  orthostatic (supine / standing) blood pressure assessments.  survey of autonomic symptom scores.  neurologic exam (neuropathy impairment score [nis]).  anti-tanezumab antibody assessments.  physical examinations. tertiary endpoints pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  plasma tanezumab concentrations.  serum ngf concentrations.  serum and urine osteoarthritis biomarker concentrations."
" ovarian cancer is the name for cancer that originates in the ovary, which is the female reproductive organ that produces eggs and sex hormones. ovarian cancer is a major cause of cancer death in women. epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type of ovarian cancer, and it originates in the cells that cover the outer surface of the ovary. researchers are looking for treatments for ovarian cancer. avelumab is a medicine that may work by targeting a protein called programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1) found on the cancer cell. pd-l1 is involved in the bodys immune system response to cancer. when this study was started, avelumab was being tested for use in women with advanced ovarian cancer. although avelumab is approved in other types of cancer, it is not approved for use in ovarian cancer. for women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, the standard treatment includes a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. chemotherapy is often used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might remain. it can also be used before surgery. this approach is usually effective, but in many cases the cancer comes back. the main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab) both during and/or after standard chemotherapy treatment would increase the amount of time it takes for ovarian cancer to worsen (progress). the study also evaluated the overall safety of avelumab alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale Ovarian cancer (OC) is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer and the fifth most common cause of cancer mortality in women. Fewer than 40% of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are cured.1 The incidence of ovarian cancer increases with age and is most prevalent in the eighth decade of life. The median age at the time of diagnosis is 63 years, and 70% of patients present with advanced disease.2 Although expectations for long-term survival can be very high if the cancer is identified and treated early, women who are diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer continue to have poor long-term survival due to refractory, resistant, or recurrent disease and most will die within 5 years. Carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel is thecurrent standard of care in the first-line epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)treatment setting following debulking surgeryfor patients with stage IC or higher, as well as selected stage IA-B patients (those with high grade or clear cell histology). Chemotherapy is administered for a total of 6-8cycles.3 Complete response is achieved in approximately 75% of patients, but most patients ultimately succumb to the disease with median progression-free survival (PFS)of approximately 18months.4 Therefore, there remains a high unmet need for newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and combination regimens able to modify the natural history of the disease. Recently, the dose-dense frontline chemotherapy regimen of weekly paclitaxel combined with Q3W carboplatin has been increasing in usage.5,6 The current standard of care in the frontline maintenancetreatment setting is region-dependent. Some patients receive bevacizumabin combination with chemotherapy, followed by one year of bevacizumabmaintenancein regions where bevacizumab is approved in this setting. For a significant number of newly diagnosed patients, the standard of care remains a platinum doublet chemotherapy followed by observation. Programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1, also called B7-H1 or CD274) has a known role in the suppression of T-cell responses. The PD-1receptor is expressed on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. By interaction with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, PD-1delivers a series of strong inhibitory signals to inhibit T-cell functions.7,9,10 Avelumab*(MSB0010718C), a fully human antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype, specifically targets and blocks PD-L1, the ligand for PD-1receptor. In preclinical studies, the combination of avelumab with chemotherapy(gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, 5FU) showed improved anti-tumor activity over single-agent chemotherapy.11 Preliminary data from the ongoing ovarian cancer Study EMR 100070-001, which is being conducted by Merck KGaA/EMD Serono (EudraCT number 2013-002834-19, NCT01772004),showed an overall response rate (ORR)of 10.7% (8/75) and stable disease in an additional 44% (33/75) of patients with advanced ovarian cancer.12 *Avelumab is the proposed International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for the anti-PD- Preliminary subgroup analysis demonstrated increased activity in patients with lower tumor burden, lower number of prior therapies, and platinum sensitivity.12 Therefore, avelumab has the potential to change the natural history of disease in the maintenance setting following frontline chemotherapy, when tumor burden is small. Patients with minimal residual disease are thought of as the ideal candidates for immunotherapy approaches in ovarian cancer.13 In addition, there are emerging data supporting the rationale for combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy.14,15 Chemotherapy has been shown to have immunostimulatory properties by stimulating the release of neoantigens and adjuvants by dying cells, increasing susceptibility to immune attack, and preferentially reducing immunosuppressive cells such as T regulatory cells.16,17,18 In summary, avelumab demonstrated promising antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with ovarian cancer and has the potential to improve the durability of response to platinum-based therapy in the frontline setting when combined with chemotherapy and in the maintenance setting. Study Objectives Co-Primary Objectives: 1. To demonstrate that avelumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance (Arm C) is superior to platinum-based chemotherapy alone followed by observation(Arm A) in prolonging progression free survival (PFS) in patients with previously untreated epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). 2. To demonstrate that platinum-based chemotherapy alone followed by avelumab maintenance (Arm B) is superior to platinum-based chemotherapy alone followed by observation(Arm A) in prolonging PFS in patients with previously untreated EOC. Secondary Objectives  To compare Arm C and Arm B to Arm A in patients with previously untreated EOC, with respect to overall survival (OS).  To evaluate the anti-tumor activity ineach treatment arm.  To evaluate the overall safety profile in each treatment arm.  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of paclitaxel and carboplatin alone and in combination with avelumab.  To evaluate the PK of avelumab alone and in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel (Arms B and C).  To evaluate the immunogenicity of avelumab alone and in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel (Arms B and C)."
" ibuprofen and acetaminophen are 2 medications commonly used for relieving pain and fever. both of these medications can be bought without a doctors prescription (over the counter), but they work in slightly different ways. ibuprofen works by blocking chemicals called prostaglandins that the body makes when it is injured or in pain. researchers think that acetaminophen works by blocking certain prostaglandins that are found in the central nervous system. some patients might not get enough pain relief from taking either ibuprofen or acetaminophen alone. also, taking higher doses of ibuprofen or acetaminophen can cause unwanted medical problems, such as liver problems or stomach damage and bleeding, without giving patients greater pain relief. the main purpose of this study was to find out whether a new study drug that combines low doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen together in the same tablet (study drug) could relieve pain better than placebo (looks just like the study drug, but with no medicine). for this study, the dose was 2 tablets that provided ibuprofen 250 mg and acetaminophen 500 mg. researchers wanted to know:  would patients who took the study drug have more pain relief after dental extraction, compared to patients who took the placebo? dental extraction means having teeth removed. to answer this question, researchers asked patients to rate their pain, using a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale Ibuprofen (IBU) and acetaminophen (APAP) are the two most widely used non-prescription analgesic/ antipyretic drugs both in the United States and globally. Ibuprofen, a traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), decreases the synthesis of pain-and inflammation-promoting prostaglandins via non-selective inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2).1 Both drugs have been extensively studied, and their efficacy and safety profiles in humans are well-established. IBU and APAP do not share metabolic pathways, which diminishes the likelihood of drug-drug interactions.4 Pharmacokinetic studies5,6 have demonstrated that there are no alterations in drug levels when the two analgesics are administered together, which is consistent with a lack of drug-drug interactions. Pfizer Consumer Healthcare (PCH) conducted a proof-of-concept (POC) dental pain study (B5061001) to determine the minimum dose of IBU and APAP fixed-dose combination that was superior to IBU 400 mg. Three IBU/APAP fixed dose combinations (FDCs)were evaluated for overall analgesic efficacy: 200 mg/500 mg, 250 mg/500mg, and 300mg/500mg, provided as two tablets, compared to IBU 400mg and placebo in the third molar extraction model of dental pain. The results indicated that all active treatments were significantly better than placebo for all endpoints. Furthermore, the 200mg/500mg FDC formulation was numerically better compared to IBU 400 mg for the primary and most of the secondary endpoints. As anticipated, the overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was comparable across all treatment groups with no meaningful differences observed in any system organ class (SOC). There were no safety concerns observed and all treatments were well tolerated. Previous-published studies7,8 have also shown that FDC IBU 200 mg/APAP 500 mg was statistically superior to APAP 1000 mg and nearly significantly superior to IBU 400mg, suggesting a synergistic analgesic effect. This potential synergistic analgesic effect would suggest lower doses of each medication can be used in combination to provide superior analgesia compared to maximum amounts of either medication alone. Based on these results, PCH proposes to continue the development of a non-prescription IBU/APAP 250 mg/500 mg FDC (administered as two tablets of 125 mg/250 mg IBU/APAP)to support the overthe counter (OTC) approval of an FDC of IBU and APAP tablet that would provide superior analgesia and antipyresis compared to the maximum single OTC dose of either monocomponent alone. Objectives and Endpoints The objective of the study is to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety ofFDC IBU/APAP 250 mg/500 mg dosed every 8 hours compared to placebo in a 48-hour period following extraction of 3 third molar teeth. Primary Efficacy Endpoint  SPID[11] (sum of pain intensity difference scores) from 0-24 hours (time-weighted sum of PID[11] scores based on the 11-point numerical Pain Severity Rating[PSR] scale). Secondary Endpoints  SPID[11] (time-weighted sum of Pain Intensity Difference scores PID[11] based on the 11-point Numerical PSR scale) from 0-8, 6-8, 8-16, 0-16, and 0-48hours;  Duration of reliefafter first dose, as measured by the time from first dose to rescue medication or second dose whichever occurs first;  Time to onset of meaningful relief for the first dose."
" ulcerative colitis (or uc) is a long-term inflammatory medical condition that affects the large intestines (also known as the colon). the exact cause of uc is not known. it is thought that uc is caused by an overactive immune system, which is normally responsible for fighting infections. medicines are available that lower the activity of the immune system, but some patients with uc do not get better when taking these medicines. some patients who do get better when taking these medicines still have their uc get worse over time. researchers are looking for new treatments that can help treat patients with uc. pf-06480605 is an investigational medicine, and is a type of medicine that is called a monoclonal antibody. monoclonal antibodies are special proteins made by cells of the immune system that bind to and block the activity of other proteins. pf-06480605 blocks the activity of an inflammatory protein called tl1a, which is thought to make uc worse. by blocking this protein, researchers hope to lower inflammation in the large intestines and help patients with uc get better. researchers are studying pf-06480605 to see if it can safely treat moderate to severe uc. to test the effectiveness of this medicine, the researchers asked:  do patients treated with pf-06480605 have their uc improve after 14 weeks? to measure improvement, the researchers used a test called the mayo endoscopic subscore to measure how severe each patients uc was.  what medical problems do patients with uc have when they are treated with pf-06480605? ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: The investigational product (IP), PF-06480605, is currently being developed for the  treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PF-06480605 is a fully human neutralizing antibody against Tumor Necrosis Factor-like  Ligand 1A (TL1A), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of cytokines.  PF-06480605 contains three mutations in the Fc region to reduce effector function. Its  mechanism of action is to neutralize the binding and subsequent signaling of TL1A to its  functional receptor Death Receptor 3 (DR3). The TL1A/DR3 pathway has been implicated in the regulation of pathogenic Th1, Th2, Th9 and Th17 T-cells, and of NK and NK-T cell responses, in immune-mediated diseases. The  TL1A expression on antigen presenting cells (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells) and  DR3 expression on effector cells (ILC2, T-cells, NK and NK-T cells) is highly dependent on  pro-inflammatory conditions. Moreover, data from nonclinical species and humans implicate  TL1A in the pathophysiology of IBD. 1 This multicenter, single arm (non-placebo controlled), two-stage study will be the first use of  PF-06480605 in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). The objectives of  this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy (based  on Mayo endoscopic subscore) of PF-06480605. The current non-clinical toxicology package available will support a 12 week treatment  period. To mitigate the need for a placebo arm, endoscopic improvement, a more objective endpoint, with lower placebo rates than clinical disease activity scores, was selected as the  primary endpoint. All colonoscopies will be read by a Central Reader who will be blinded to  study treatment. An induction period (12 weeks of dosing with primary endpoint at  Week 14) greater than the traditional 8 weeks was chosen to increase the likelihood of  achieving endoscopic improvement. Objectives and Endpoints Primary Objectives  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06480605 in subjects with moderate to  severe UC.  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06480605 in induction of endoscopic improvement (as  assessed by Mayo endoscopic subscore) at Week 14 in subjects with moderate to  severe UC. Secondary Objectives  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06480605 in induction of remission at Week 14  (defined as a total Mayo score 2 with no individual subscore >1) in subjects with  moderate to severe UC.  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06480605 in induction of endoscopic remission at  Week 14 (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0) in subjects with moderate to  severe UC.  To describe the PK of PF-06480605 in subjects with moderate to severe UC.  To evaluate the immunogenicity of PF-06480605 in subjects with moderate to severe  UC.  To evaluate disease and pathway related biomarkers (ie, high sensitivity C-reactive  protein [hsCRP] and fecal calprotectin), and serum total soluble TL1A (sTL1A). Primary Endpoints  Safety and tolerability of PF-06480605: treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs),  withdrawal due to adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be  reported.  Endoscopic improvement at Week 14 (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0  or 1, and without friability)."
" parkinsons disease is a disease of the nervous system that affects movement. patients with parkinsons disease can have many symptoms, such as weakness, tremor, stiff muscles, and slowed movements. these are known as motor symptoms. the symptoms of parkinsons disease usually develop slowly over several years. doctors arent sure exactly what causes parkinsons disease, but it occurs when certain nerve cells in the brain die. these nerve cells are found in the part of the brain that controls movement, and they make a chemical called dopamine. many medicines used to treat parkinsons disease work by increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain, which could help decrease parkinsons symptoms. pf-06649751 was studied as a possible treatment for parkinsons disease. the main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of pf-06649751 in patients with parkinsons disease who were at an early stage of the disease. researchers wanted to answer this question:  did motor symptoms decrease in patients who received pf-06649751, compared to patients who received placebo? a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale In Parkinsons disease, motor dysfunction can be mitigated via pharmacologicactivation of direct striatal output pathways containing dopamine-1 receptors (D1R)and/orindirect striatal output pathways containing dopamine-2 receptors (D2R). L-Dopa therapy acts through both pathways and effects an improvement inmotor symptoms, which unfortunately diminishes over time.1 As Parkinsons disease progresses, motor fluctuations reflect this diminished effectiveness, while dyskinesias emerge as manifestations of excessive dopaminergic stimulation. As a consequence,the clinical response to L-Dopais graduallyconfinedtoa relentlessly narrowing therapeutic window. Agonists at the D2 and D3 receptors (D2/D3R), such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine,arealsoapproved for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinsons disease.2 However, the maximal efficacy observed is considered inferior to L-Dopa. Efforts to develop selective D1R agonists have been ongoing for decades. Unlike D2/D3R agonists, D1R agonists may produce L-Dopa like efficacy through selective stimulation of the direct pathway. Development of a novel pharmaceutical agent that improves motor function without associated motor fluctuations or dyskinesias will provide an important new treatment option for patients with Parkinsons disease who are at increasing risk of experiencingthese manifestations of the conditionlike the patients at early stage of the disease. PF-06649751 is a potent and highly selective dopamine D1/D5 receptor partial agonist being evaluated for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinsons disease. PF-06649751 (0.02-0.15mg/kg, subcutaneous administration (SC)) was tested for its ability to improve parkinsonian symptoms in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of Parkinsons disease in monkeys. Treatment with PF-06649751 dose-dependently improved both parkinsonian disability and bradykinesia scores, and this effect was maintained over three consecutive days of dosing. In monkeys primed to exhibit dyskinesias by prior chronic treatment with L-Dopa, PF-06649751 (0.1 and 0.15mg/kg) reduced disability as effectively as an optimal dose of L-Dopa but with a longer duration of action and a lower level of dyskinesia. A total of 104healthy subjects (88 receiving PF-06649751) have participatedin the completed single ascending dose (B7601001; n=18), multiple ascending dose (B7601002; n=77), and single dose plus trimethobenzamide hydrochloride (TMB; B7601007, n=9) Phase1 trials. Additionally PF-06649751 has been administered to 45 Parkinsons disease patients in one open-label multiple ascending dose study (B7601005) and 18 Parkinsons disease patients have been assigned to study treatment with PF-06649751 or placebo in one double-blind, single ascending dose study (B7601009). The results of study B7601001, B7601002,and B7601007 and the possible risks associated with the administration of PF-06649751 are summarized in the Investigators Brochure (IB). This study is intended to complement other Phase 1 and 2 clinical investigations, by providing safety and efficacy experience in a population of patients with early stage Parkinsons disease. Study Objectives Primary Objective  To evaluate the effect of PF-06649751 administered once dailyon motor symptoms in subjectswithearly stage Parkinsons disease.

" many treatments for cancer work by trying to help the bodys immune system attack and kill cancer cells. however, these treatments do not work for all patients, and some only work for a short time before the patients cancer gets worse. researchers think that combining different medications that help the immune system fight cancer in different ways could help patients cancer get better. arry-382 is a study drug that has not been approved by the united states food and drug administration (fda). arry-382 is taken by mouth once a day. arry-382 is thought to work by helping the immune system slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. pembrolizumab is approved by the fda for the treatment of patients with many different types of cancer, and is given through a needle into a vein (iv). pembrolizumab also works by helping the immune system slow or stop the growth of cancer cells, but in a different way than arry-382. studies in animals found that combining these 2 types of medicines helped the immune system do a better job of slowing the growth of tumors. this study was divided into 2 parts, or phases. the main purpose of the first phase of the study (phase 1) was to determine the best dose of arry-382 to use in phase 2 when given with the drug pembrolizumab. to do this, the researchers asked,  what dose-limiting toxicities, or dlts, did patients have when taking arry-382 with pembrolizumab? dlts are certain medical problems caused by taking arry-382 with pembrolizumab which require the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the medicine temporarily or permanently. phase 2 of the study was designed to see whether arry-382, when taken together with the drug pembrolizumab, had a beneficial effect on the patients cancer (improved symptoms, reduced rate of tumor growth or decreased the size of tumors in the body). to do this, the researchers asked,  how many patients had their cancer get better when taking arry-382 with pembrolizumab? the researchers also monitored the patients for any medical problems that they had during the study.

" what is cancer? cancer is the name for a group of diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. most types of cancer cause solid tumors to form, which are masses of these abnormal cells. what is talazoparib? talazoparib (talzenna ) is known as a parp inhibitor. parp inhibitors are drugs  that inhibit (stop) the normal activity of certain proteins called poly (adp-ribose) polymerases, also called parps. parps can be found in all normal and cancer cells, and are involved in the repair of dna. mistakes in the dna can happen when cells divide. if the mistakes are not repaired, the cell will usually die and be replaced. clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other parp inhibitors, may reduce tumor size and slow tumor growth in patients with certain types of cancer. talazoparib is given in a capsule and is taken by mouth once daily at around the same time every day. what was the purpose of this study? talazoparib is now approved in the united states, the european union, and other countries for the treatment of people with a type of cancer known as metastatic breast cancer with brca mutations. this study was done to learn more about the safety of talazoparib when used long term. researchers wanted to know: what medical problems did participants have? ","SYNOPSIS Title of Study: A Single-Arm, Open-Label, Multicenter, ExtendedTreatment, Safety Study inPatients Treated WithTalazoparib Protocol Identifier: MDV3800-13(C3441010) Phase of Development: 2 Number of Patients: Approximately 150 Study Centers: Approximately 50 (international) Study Objective: Toobtainadditional safety data onlong-termtalazoparib use Methods:This is a single-arm, open-label, extended treatment, safety study in patients treated with talazoparib (also known as MDV3800, BMN 673, PF-06944076,) as a single agent or in combinationwith another agent in qualifying originating clinical studies sponsored by Medivation/Pfizer. The safety and tolerability of long-term talazoparib use will be evaluated, and the data collected will be limited to safety assessments. The study provides access to single-agent talazoparib for qualifying patients who may benefit from continuing therapy with talazoparib. Eligible patients must have received talazoparib in a qualifying study and have no ongoing grade 3 or 4talazoparib-related toxicities. Patients must receive their first dose of talazoparib in this protocol within 2months after their last dose of talazoparib in the originating study and may not receive any intervening antineoplastic therapies before starting this study. Patients will have clinic visits approximately every4 weeks for the first 24 weeks and then approximately every 8 weeks thereafter (additional visits for laboratory testing every 2 weeks through week 9 and every 4 weeks thereafter)or as clinically indicated (patients enrolling from study PRP-001 may continue the last visit schedule they tolerated in that studyeg,if a PRP-001 patient is on an every 4 week schedule in the originating study, the patient is required to complete the week5 and week9 visits but not the Complete Blood Count (CBC) assessments atweek 3 and week 7; afterwards, these patients would follow the schedule of activities in Appendix1). Additional clinic visits and laboratory testing may be necessary to monitor safety (eg, fordose modification, hematologic toxicity, pregnancy testing). The maximum starting dose of talazoparib will be 1 mg/day or the last tolerated dose administered in the originating study. Talazoparib capsules will be administered by mouth once daily with orwithout food at approximately the same time of day. Patients receiving talazoparib as combination treatment in the originating study will receive talazoparib as a single agent in this extended treatment study. Talazoparib administration may continue as long as the investigator considers treatment to be providing clinical benefit or until other study discontinuation criteriaare met(Section5.3). The addition of any other antineoplastic therapy and the concurrent use of investigational agents during the study are prohibited. Study assessments will include adverse events, local clinical laboratory tests, concomitant medications, physical examinations, and vital signs (and weight). Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry) will be performed every 4 weeks through week 25 and every 8 weeks thereafter during the study. Complete blood count (CBC) tests will be completed every 2 weeks through week 9 and every 4 weeks thereafter. Women of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test every 4 weeks. Safety follow-up will be through and including 30 days after the last dose of talazoparib. Study Schematic: Keyassessments: laboratory tests,physical examinations,adverse events.

" diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (or dlbcl) is a kind of non-hodgkin lymphoma. it is the most common type of blood cancer. dlbcl happens when cells of the immune system, known as b-cells, grow and multiply uncontrollably. dlbcl occurs mostly in adults and is a fast-growing (aggressive) lymphoma. while there are treatments available for dlbcl, some patients cancer does not get better or gets worse over time. researchers are looking for new and better treatments that can be combined with other medicines to help keep patients dlbcl from getting worse over time. avelumab and utomilumab were investigational treatments for dlbcl when this study began. both of these treatments are a type of protein called monoclonal antibodies, and they are thought to work by helping the cells of the immune system fight cancer cells. although avelumab is approved for use in other types of cancer under the brand name bavencio, it is not approved for use in dlbcl. the medicines rituximab, azacitidine, and bendamustine are commonly used to treat dlbcl, but these medicines may not work well for all patients. patients whos dlbcl did not get better with approved cancer treatments are said to have refractory dlbcl. patients whose dlbcl got better after treatment but later got worse are said to have relapsed dlbcl. this study was divided into 2 parts, or phases. the main purpose of the first phase of the study (phase 1) was to learn about the effects of avelumab when given with other investigational or approved cancer therapies. this information would determine the best treatment combination to use in the second phase of the study (phase 3). to do this, the researchers asked:  how many dose-limiting toxicities, or dlts, did patients have when taking avelumab with other therapies? dlts are certain medical problems caused by taking avelumab which require the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the medicine temporarily or permanently.  how many patients had their dlbcl get better when taking avelumab with other therapies? to do this, the researchers looked to see if the patients tumors got smaller after taking the study medications. "," Study B9991011 is a multi-center, international, randomized, open-label, 2-component (Phase1b followed by Phase3), parallel-arm study of avelumab in combination with various agents for the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Agents that will be tested include: (i) Utomilumab, a novel fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody agonist of 4-1BB (CD137, TNFRSF9), (ii) Azacitidine, a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and epigenetic agent which has been shown to have potential immune priming activity through various mechanisms that include the induction of Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PD-L1 on tumor cells as well as the induction of tumor neo-antigen expression, (iii) Rituximab, a CD20 antagonist antibody, and (iv) Bendamustine, an alkylating chemotherapy agent, which is one of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended agents for the salvage therapy of patients with DLBCL who are ineligible for high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).1 The treatment regimens in the study include avelumab combined with: (i) Rituximab plus utomilumab, (ii) Azacitidine plus utomilumab, or (iii) Rituximab plus bendamustine. Avelumab will be administered as a 1 hour intravenous (IV) infusion once every 2weeks of each 28-day cycle. In order to mitigate infusion related reactions, a premedication with an antihistamine and with paracetamol (acetaminophen) approximately 30 to 60minutes prior to each dose of avelumab is mandatory (for example, 25-50mg diphenhydramine and 500-650mg paracetamol [acetaminophen] IV or oral equivalent). This may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines, as appropriate. Premedication prior to rituximab is mandatory; if avelumab is administered more than 1hour after rituximab then the premedication must be repeated. The line should be flushed, according to local practice, between infusions, and a new administration set should be used for avelumab. Site staff should make every effort to target the timing of avelumab infusion to be as close to 1hour as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, time windows of minus 10minutes and plus 20minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 50-80minutes). The exact duration of infusion should be recorded in both source documents each 28-day cycle. Avelumab must be administered at least 1hour after the end of utomilumab administration until the patient is no longer achieving clinical benefit. If Cycle1 and 2dosing administration is well tolerated; Cycle3 and subsequent cycles may decrease administration of utomilumab and avelumab from at least 1hour apart to 30-60minutes apart. Utomilumab is administered for as long as the patient is benefitting. Treatment through progression of disease is permitted if the Investigator and Sponsor agree and the patient has provided written consent. Azacitidine 40 mg/m2(SC) will be administered in the morning on Days 1 -5 of each 28-day cycle, until the patient is no longer achieving clinical benefit. Rituximab is administered in this study at the dose of 375mg/m2up to 8cycles maximum as an IV infusion in the morning of each 28day cycle on Day1. Rituximab infusion must be completed at least 1hour prior to utomilumab and bendamustine. Rituximab should not be administered as an IV push or bolus. Premedication with acetaminophen and an antihistamine should be administered 30minutes before each IVinfusion. Premedication prior to rituximab is mandatory; if avelumab is administered more than 1hour after rituximab, then the premedication must be repeated. The first infusion should be initiated at a rate of 50mg/hr. In the absence of infusion toxicity, the rate of infusion may be increased by 50mg/hr increments every 30minutes, to a maximum of 400mg/hr. Subsequent infusions of rituximab should be initiated at a rate of 100mg/hr. In the absence of infusion toxicity, the rate of infusion may be increased by 100mg/hr increments at 30minute intervals, to a maximum of 400mg/hr. Bendamustine is administered in the Phase1b (Treatment ArmC) and in the Phase3 investigational arm (in the event that Treatment ArmC advances to the Phase3 component of the study) at 90mg/m2IVinfusion up to 6cycles maximum. Intra-patient dose escalation is not permitted. Note that in the Phase3 Investigators Choice option (ArmE), bendamustine is administered at a higher dose of 120mg/m2on Days1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle, for up to 6cycles. Gemcitabine is administered at 1000mg/m2IV infusion up to 6cycles maximum on Day2 and Day17 of each 28day cycle as part of the Investigators Choice option (ArmE) in Phase3. Gemcitabine must be administered at a fixed dose rate of 16.7mg/m2/minute over 60minutes. This prolonged administration schedule has been shown to achieve superior intracellular drug concentration as compared with the 30minute IV schedule. Oxaliplatin is administered at 100mg/m2IV infusion up to 6 cycles maximum on Day2 and Day17 of each 28-day cycle as part of the Investigators Choice option (Arm E) in Phase3."
" what is ulcerative colitis? ulcerative colitis (or uc) is a long-term inflammatory medical condition that affects the large intestines (also known as the colon). symptoms include cramping, constipation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and fatigue (feeling very tired). the exact cause of uc is not known. it is thought that uc is caused by an overactive immune system, which is normally responsible for fighting infections. medicines are available that lower the activity of the immune system, but some people with uc do not get better when taking these medicines. some people who do get better when taking these medicines still have worse uc over time. researchers are looking for new treatments that can help treat patients with uc. what are ritlecitinib and brepocitinib? ritlecitinib is a small molecule oral medication (swallowed). small molecules can move easily through the cell membrane to interact with other molecules, such as enzymes, inside a cell. ritlecitinib prevents (inhibits) certain enzymes from working. enzymes are protein molecules in cells which speed up chemical reactions in the body. the enzymes that ritlecitinib inhibits are known as janus kinase 3 (jak3) and the tyrosine-protein (tec) kinase family. both of these enzymes help control inflammatory pathways in the cell. they also cause molecules known as cytokines to be released. cytokines cause inflammation. this inflammation is usually used by the immune system to fight infections that may be caused by viruses or bacteria. in people with uc, the bodys immune system causes inflammation even although they are healthy. brepocitinib is another small molecule oral medication. it inhibits enzymes known as janus kinase 1 (jak1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (tyk2). these enzymes control signals to the immune system cells that produce cytokines. by stopping the function of jak1 and tyk2, brepocitinib may prevent the abnormal immune system response and inflammation in people with uc. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of the study was to find out if ritlecitinib or brepocitinib was more effective at relieving uc symptoms. in addition, both study medications were compared to placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medication. researchers wanted to know: did the participants taking ritlecitinib or brepocitinib have more relief from their uc symptoms? ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: The Janus kinase (JAK) family kinases mediate signal transduction via interactions with  type I and type II cytokine receptors. Upon binding of the cytokine to its receptor, the  associated JAKs are activated, and phosphorylate each other and the receptor. The  phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for the signal transducers and activators of  transcription (STAT) family (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and  STAT6) of transcription factors. The STATs are then phosphorylated by the co-localized  JAKs, which stabilize homo- or heterodimeric STAT complexes that translocate the nucleus  where they bind to specific gene promoters and activate transcription of a range of target  genes. PF-06651600 (ritlecitinib) is an orally bioavailable small molecule that selectively inhibits JAK3 by irreversibly blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site without  significantly inhibiting the other three JAK isoforms (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2).  PF-06651600 also inhibits irreversibly the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular  carcinoma (TEC kinase) family (BTK, bone marrow tyrosine kinase on chromosome  X (BMX), (interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase) ITK, TEC, and tyrosine kinase expressed in  T cells (TXK)), with high selectivity over the broader kinome. The selective inhibition of  JAK3 will lead to modulation of -common chain cytokine pathways, such as IL-7, IL-9,  IL-15 and IL-21, which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis  (UC). Furthermore, in vivo PF-06651600 will spare signaling of key immunoregulatory cytokines, such as IL-10, IL-27 and IL-35, which have been shown to be critical to maintain  immune homeostasis in the digestive tract. Finally, TEC kinase inhibition will impact cluster  of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T and natural killer (NK) cells cytotoxic functions, which play a  role in the pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Taken together, it is  hypothesized that PF-06651600 could be efficacious in the treatment of UC. PF-06700841 (brepocitinib) is an orally bioavailable, small molecule, potent dual inhibitor of  human tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (TYK2) and JAK1. JAK1 inhibition will impact the  signaling of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-gamma and cytokines  signaling through the -common chain receptor such as IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21, while  the inhibition of TYK2 will block the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines  interferon-gamma and IL-17 through upstream inhibition of the IL-12/Th1 and  IL-23/Th17 pathways. Taken together, it is hypothesized that dual inhibition of both  TYK2 and JAK1 could be efficacious in the treatment of UC. Both PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 are under development as induction and chronic  therapy for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

" plaque psoriasis is a disease that can cause a red, scaly rash to form on the skin. the rash may be painful or itchy. plaque psoriasis can also affect other parts of the body, such as the joints or nails. these problems are because the immune system, whose job is to attack foreign invaders like viruses and other germs, mistakenly attacks the body instead. there is no cure for plaque psoriasis at this time, but common treatments include medicines that may control pain, reduce inflammation, and help prevent the immune system from attacking the body. pf-06700841 is a medicine that is being studied as a possible treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. pf-06700841 may help to stop the immune system from attacking the body, and reduce inflammation. because it is still being tested, pf-06700841 has not been approved for use in patients. the main purpose of this study was to find out how pf-06700841 works to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, compared to a placebo. a placebo looks just like the medicine, but doesnt have any medicine in it. researchers wanted to know:  at week 12 of the study, did patients who took pf-06700841 have an improvement in psoriasis symptoms, compared to patients who took placebo? to answer this question, the researchers used a tool called the pasi (psoriasis area and severity index) to measure plaque psoriasis symptoms. the pasi looks at the redness, thickness, and scaling of the rash, as well as how much of the body is covered by the rash. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale PF-06700841 is a dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor with good selectivity profile over other human kinases. Based on its cytokine inhibition profile, PF-06700841 is expected to target the TH17 pathway directly by inhibiting TYK2 and indirectly by inhibiting JAK1, and to provide therapeutic benefit in the treatmentof plaque psoriasis. In afirst in human clinical trial of PF-06700841, psoriasis subjects who received active treatment with PF-06700841 once daily for 28days had clinically meaningful decreases in disease activity. Preliminary safety and pharmacodynamic results from that trial support further development of PF-06700841 in plaque psoriasis. This multicenter study is being conducted to provide additional PF-06700841 safety and tolerability data, and to further explore the clinical efficacy of PF-06700841 in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Additionally, the study is intended to enable selection of oral dose and dosing regimen for the future clinicaldevelopment of PF-06700841.

" rheumatoid arthritis, or ra, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. ra is an autoimmune disease, which means that patients with ra have an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as the joints. ra can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes unchecked, so researchers are looking for new treatment options for ra. pf-06651600 is a medicine that is being studied as a possible treatment for ra. because it is still being tested, pf-06651600 has not been approved for use outside of research studies. the main goal of this study was to learn more about the use of pf-06651600 in patients with ra. researchers wanted to know:  at week 8 of the study, did patients who received pf-06651600 show an improvement in ra, compared to patients who received placebo? a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. to answer this question, the researchers used a tool called the simple disease activity index (sdai) to assess ra signs and symptoms. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: PF-06651600 is a potent, Janus kinase (JAK)3 selective, covalent inhibitor. It is an orally bioavailable small molecule that selectively inhibits JAK3 by irreversibly blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site without significantly inhibiting the other three JAK isoforms (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2). The molecule also has a high specificity against the broad human kinome. This JAK3-selective inhibition will lead to modulation of -common chain cytokine pathways, such as IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21, some of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). PF-06651600will spare inhibition of key immuno-regulatorycytokines, such as IL-10, IL-35 which play a protective role in RA. Inhibition of JAK2 cytokine signaling, implicated to be associated with adverse effects such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia14 will also be spared, thus making JAK3-selective inhibitors an attractive therapeutic modality. JAK3 is also expressed only in the hematopoietic cells and thus the rationale for improved therapeutic index of PF-06651600 in RA over pan-JAK inhibition. This multicenter, placebo controlled study will be the first determination of safety and efficacy of PF-06651600 in subjects with moderatetosevere activeRA who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate (up to approximately 50% of subjects may also have had an inadequate response to 1 anti-TNFbiologic DMARD).

" hemophilia is a disease that is inherited, which means it runs in families, and it mainly affects boys and men. people with hemophilia have problems with their blood not clotting. after an injury, someone with hemophilia will bruise more easily and, if cut, will bleed for longer. sometimes the bleeding can happen inside the body and this internal bleeding can be serious as it can cause damage. doctors prescribe medicines called factor replacement therapy to help the blood to clot in people with hemophilia. these treatments work by replacing the clotting factors that are missing from the blood of a person with hemophilia. clotting factors are proteins in the blood that help stop bleeding after in injury as well as prevent bleeding from happening. there are many different clotting factors in the blood and these are numbered using roman numerals. people with hemophilia a are missing factor viii (8) and people with hemophilia b are missing factor ix (9). this means factor viii is given in factor replacement therapy to people with hemophilia a and factor ix is given to people with hemophilia b. factor replacement therapy is given by infusion and the medicine is prepared in a syringe and then injected or pushed through a patients skin into a vein. a vein is a tube that carries blood around the body. other treatments are also available that can be given by injection, or a shot, subcutaneously, to prevent or reduce the number of bleeding episodes (also known as bleeds). subcutaneously means the injection is given just underneath the skin. marstacimab (pf-06741086) is a new kind of treatment being studied for hemophilia. it works in a different way to other treatments to help blood to clot. the treatment is given subcutaneously and, over time, the medicine is able to reach the bloodstream where it may help to prevent or reduce the number of bleeding episodes. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Study B7841002 is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multiple ascending dose clinical study in  subjects with severe hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors to Factor VIII (FVIII) or  Factor IX (FIX). This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics  (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy of multiple subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous  (IV) doses of PF-06741086, a monoclonal antibody that targets tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).  TFPI is an antagonist of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. PF-06741086, through its  neutralization of TFPI, is expected to increase coagulation activity. Study B7841002 will  assess the effect of PF-06741086 on various measures of coagulation, including the number  of acute bleeding episodes during a 3-month treatment period as a measure of prophylaxis  efficacy. Satisfactory safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy data from this study are  intended to support the development of PF-06741086 as a monotherapy for prophylactic  treatment to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia  A or B with or without inhibitors.  Subjects with severe hemophilia A or B (defined by factor VIII or factor IX activity 1%),  including subjects with inhibitors to factor VIII or factor IX (positive inhibitor test result [above the upper limit of normal]), who receive bypass agents as primary treatment for  bleeding episodes) will be recruited into B7841002. Subjects with inhibitors who are  currently treated with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC, eg, FEIBA) and  cannot substitute treatment with recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, eptacog alfa [activated]) as  their standard of care for treatment of acute bleeding episodes (at a dose level of  approximately 90 g/kg) for the duration of the study are not eligible. Subjects must be on  an episodic (on-demand) treatment regimen at the time of study enrollment and also have a  documented history of at least 6 acute bleeding episodes in the 6 months prior to study enrollment. Subjects must washout from any factor replacement or bypass agent therapy  prior to screening and prior to study treatment. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be assigned to a PF-06741086 treatment cohort,  defined by a specific dose level, dose frequency and route of administration. Subjects will be  treated with PF-06741086 for up to 3 months, with a maximum of 5 months expected for  overall study participation. Approximately 24 subjects (4 treatment cohorts with 6 subjects  per cohort) are planned to be treated. The planned number of subjects, cohorts, dose levels, dose frequencies and route of administration may change depending on the results from each  cohort dosed in the study. Subjects will be required to attend weekly clinic visits during the first month of the study  (Day 1 to Day 29). An additional two clinic visits at Day 2 and Day 4 will be required for  PK/PD blood draws. Through Day 29 (at a minimum), data will be reviewed to determine if  PF-06741086 is safe and well tolerated. Dosing of subjects in any cohort may be stopped if  the B7841002 protocol-specified stopping criteria are met, or if available data indicate that  the current dose is not safe and well tolerated. If available safety, tolerability and PK data  through Day 29 are permissive for dose escalation, a cohort at a higher dose level (SC or IV  administration) may be opened for enrollment. Alternatively, a cohort at a lower dose level  may be opened if data are supportive. In addition, if the dose level under review is safe and well tolerated through Day 29,  treatment will continue for the subjects in that respective cohort during the subsequent 2 months (Day 30 to Day 85). During this period, clinic visits at Day 30 and Day 33 will be  required for PK/PD blood draws for all cohorts. Subjects in the SC cohorts will receive treatment on Day 36, Day 43, Day 50, Day 57, Day 64, Day 71, Day 78, follow-up on  Day 85, and end-of-study procedures on Day 113. Subjects in the IV cohort will return to the  clinic for treatment on Day 57, follow-up on Day 85, and end-of-study procedures on  Day 113. Follow-up beyond Day 113 may be required for any subjects that test positive for  an anti-drug or neutralizing antibody during the study. There is no formal statistical hypothesis planned for testing in B7841002. There is no formal  sample size calculation informing cohort sample size or overall study sample size. The  cohort sample sizes and overall study sample size are based on clinical considerations to  balance the need to minimize exposure of study subjects to the test article with the need to  provide adequate safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy data at each dose level and/or route  of administration. Additional subjects and/or cohorts may be enrolled in the event that the  number of dosing cohorts or size of dosing cohorts is increased to fully explore the dose  range and/or clinical profile at the respective dose levels. Safety endpoints will include treatment emergent adverse events (graded by the NIAID DMID severity scale), infusion/injection site reactions, laboratory parameters that may be  modulated due to coagulopathy (eg, prothrombin time [PT]/INR, activated partial  thromboplastin time [aPTT], fibrinogen, antithrombin III [ATIII], platelet counts) and  parameters to screen for possible thrombotic events (eg, cardiac troponin I). PK and PD  endpoints include concentrations of PF-06741086 in plasma, non-compartmental PK  parameters, measures of target binding by PF-06741086 (ie, TFPI level) or downstream  pharmacological activities of TFPI inhibition (ie, dilute PT, thrombin generation,  prothrombin fragment 1+2, and D-dimer). Prophylaxis efficacy will be assessed by collecting the number of acute bleeding episodes per subject during the treatment period of  3 months and determining the annualized bleed rate (ABR) for comparison against historical  data. These data will be summarized descriptively for each cohort and the overall study. Demonstration of safety, tolerability and a PK/PD/efficacy profile that is supportive for  long-term chronic treatment on an acceptable dosing schedule will allow for progression of  PF-06741086 to subsequent investigations in patients with severe hemophilia A or B."
" rheumatoid arthritis, or ra, is a disease that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the joints. ra is an autoimmune disease, which means that patients with ra have an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the body, such as the joints. ra can cause permanent damage to the joints if it goes untreated, so researchers are looking for new treatment options for ra. patients in this study were treated with pf-06650833, which is an investigational drug. this means it is not approved for use in people with ra and is a new type of drug that is being studied for the treatment of ra. some of the patients in this study were also treated with tofacitinib. this is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system in people with ra. it is an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been approved, and is available by prescription, to treat adults with active, moderate to severe ra that did not respond well to medications known as disease- modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (dmards) like methotrexate. researchers did this study to see if taking pf-06650833 helped with the symptoms of ra by reducing inflammation. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Rationale: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by joint  inflammation and destruction, progressive disability and adverse psychological effects.  There is currently no cure for RA. The purpose of treatment is to control disease activity,  alleviate signs and symptoms, maintain physical function, optimize quality of life, reduce the  rate of joint damage, and, if possible, induce complete remission.  Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) partially fulfill these goals, but often fall  short of adequate minimization or prevention of progressive joint damage and optimization  of quality of life, and are not infrequently associated with clinical tolerability and/or safety  issues. Biologic DMARDs, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (TNFi), are more  efficacious than conventional synthetic DMARDs and successfully halt or slow joint damage.  Additional approved therapeutics include tocilizumab (interleukin (IL)-6 receptor  neutralizing antibody) and, in the US and more than 40 countries worldwide, tofacitinib (a  small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor). Despite the considerable list of approved  treatments for RA, there are significant numbers of patients who do not achieve remission or  indeed adequate reduction in disease activity. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PF-06650833, a selective, reversible  inhibitor of IL-1 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), as a treatment of RA. Background information on PF-06650833 can be obtained from the current version of the  PF-06650833 Investigators Brochure, which is the single reference safety document (SRSD)  for information relating to PF-06650833. Primary Objectives:  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06650833 at 12 weeks, in subjects with  moderate-severe active RA who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). Secondary Objectives:  To assess the safety of PF-06650833 for 12 weeks in subjects with RA.  To explore the dose  response relationship for efficacy in RA.  To assess other signs of clinical efficacy over 12 weeks.  To assess the effect of PF-06650833 on patient reported outcome measurements"
" what is cloistridioides difficile infection? cloistridioides difficile (previously called clostridium difficile and also known as c. difficile) is a germ or bacteria that can be found in the bowel of some people. c. difficile infections can range from a person not showing any symptoms or having mild diarrhea, to more serious complications such as severe diarrhea and life-threatening damage to the bowel. c. difficile infection mostly affects people who have recently been treated with antibiotics, have had to stay in a healthcare setting (such as a hospital or nursing home) for a long time, are over 65 years old, or have a weakened immune system because of other illnesses. the immune system is what defends the body from germs like c. difficile. what is c. difficile vaccine (pf-06425090)? vaccines work by helping the body to fight infections and prevent diseases. the c. difficile vaccine used in this study (pf-06425090) is an investigational vaccine which means it has not been approved for general use. there are currently no approved vaccines to prevent c. difficile infection. in this study, the c. difficile vaccine was given as 3 doses of 200 micrograms each. each dose was given by injection into a muscle. previous studies have already shown that pf-06425090 can produce an immune system response against c. difficile in humans when given as 3 doses at dose levels up to 200 micrograms. what was the purpose of this study? there were 2 main purposes for this study. one purpose was to learn about the safety of the c. difficile vaccine. the second purpose was to see if the c. difficile vaccine helped to prevent c. difficile infection in adults aged 50 years and older. researchers wanted to know: 1. did the c. difficile vaccine help to reduce the number of new episodes of c. difficile infection? 2. how many participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days of vaccination or placebo injection? 3. how many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, vomiting, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days of vaccination or placebo injection? 4. how many participants had medical problems during the study? what happened during the study? how was the study done? this study compared 2 groups of participants to find out if people given the c. difficile vaccine reacted differently compared to people given a placebo (saline injection). a placebo does not have any medicine in it but looks just like the medicine being tested. the study participants and researchers did not know who received the c. difficile vaccine and who received placebo. this is known as a blinded study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups similar, which then makes comparing the results between the groups more fair. a total of 17,535 participants joined the study; 8766 were assigned to the c. difficile vaccine group and 8769 participants were assigned to the placebo group. the figure below shows what happened during the study. figure 1. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Indication Pfizers investigational Clostridiumdifficilevaccine (PF-06425090) is a prophylactic vaccine that is currently being investigated for the prevention of primary C difficileinfection(CDI) in adults 50 years of age and older.

Systemic events (fever, vomiting, headache, fatigue, new or worsening muscle pain, and new or worsening joint pain), as self-reported on e-diaries for up to 7 days following each dose of investigational product.  Nonserious AEs from signing of the informed consent document (ICD)to 1month after receipt of thethird dose of investigational product.  SAEs from signing of the ICD to 6monthsafter receipt of the third dose of investigational product. a. Each subject may contribute only once to the primary endpoint. Study Design This is a Phase 3, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy, safety,and tolerability of aluminum hydroxide(AlOH)-containing C difficile vaccine (200g total toxoid) administered as a 3-dose regimen at Months 0, 1, and 6 in adults 50 years of age and older. Subjects will be randomly assigned in parallel in a 1:1ratio to receive C difficilevaccine (200g total toxoid) or placebo (saline). This is an event-driven studywith a total target of 66first primary CDI cases (meeting case definition 1 in the per-protocol-3 population); the total enrollment number may vary depending on the incidence rate of the primary endpoint, true underlying vaccine efficacy (VE),and potential early stop for efficacy or futility. Investigational Products Clostridium difficileVaccine The investigational C difficilevaccineis toxoid based. C difficiletoxin A and toxin B are inactivated by a combination of genetic mutations and chemical treatments. The vaccine is provided as a sterile lyophilized powder in a dosage strength of 200g/dose (total for toxoids A and B). The vaccine will be reconstituted with AlOHdiluent immediately before use as instructed in the investigational product (IP) manual. The AlOHdiluent is supplied as a 1-mg aluminum/mL (as AlOH) liquid suspension. Placebo The placebo will consist of a sterile normal saline solution for injection (0.9% sodium chloride injection, in a 0.5-mL dose) and will be provided by the sponsor to each study site. Statistical Methods The VE is defined as VE = 100 (1  IRR), where IRR is the infection rate ratio, the calculated ratio of first primary CDI incidence between the C difficilevaccine group and the placebo group. Three(3)formal interim analyses areplanned to check both efficacy and futility after 30, 40 and 50cases of first primary CDI have occurred from 14 days after receipt of the third dose of investigational product. Onlytheprimary efficacy endpoints will be examined during theseinterim analyses. With 30 cases of first primary CDI at the first planned interim analysis, if there are 6or fewer cases observed in the C difficilevaccine group, the null hypothesis (H )will be rejected,the 03 C difficilevaccine will be deemed efficacious,and a full analysis of the data will be conducted. If there are 11or more cases observed in the C difficilevaccine group, futility may be declared, and the study may be terminated.

" what is metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer? prostate cancer is the name for cancer that starts in the prostate, which is a small, walnut-sized gland that lies at the base of the bladder in men and is part of the male reproductive system. prostate cancer is a common cancer in men, and it is often a slow-growing cancer with few symptoms. metastatic means that the cancer has spread to a part of the body beyond the prostate. in earlier stages of the disease, male hormones, or androgens, are usually stimulating prostate cancer cells to grow. castration-resistant means that the prostate cancer continued to worsen despite receiving treatment that reduces androgen production from the testis. what is talazoparib? talazoparib (talzenna) is known as a parp inhibitor. parp inhibitors are drugs that stop the normal activity of certain proteins called poly (adp-ribose) polymerases, also called parps. parps are proteins that are found in all normal and cancer cells, and that are involved in the repair of dna. parps are needed to repair mistakes that can happen in dna when cells divide. if the mistakes are not repaired, the cell will usually die and be replaced. cells with mistakes in their dna that do not die can become cancer cells. this is known as a dna-repair defect. parp inhibitors selectively kill specific cancer cells through a mechanism called synthetic lethality, in which loss of function in 2 genes together causes cell death, but a loss of function in either gene alone would not. clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other parp inhibitors, may reduce tumor size and slow tumor growth in some men with prostate cancer. talazoparib is given in a capsule and is taken by mouth once daily at around the same time every day. what was the purpose of this study? the main purposes of this study were to learn more about the safety and about the possible effectiveness of talazoparib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and dna-repair defects. researchers wanted to know: how many participants had a partial or complete response to talazoparib treatment? what medical problems did participants have or report during the study? "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Overview Talazoparib (also known as PF-06944076, MDV3800) is being investigated for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with DNA damage repair deficienciesin men whose disease has previously progressed on novel hormonal therapy (NHT: enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate) for the treatment of mCRPC andwho were previously treated with taxane-based chemotherapyfor metastatic disease. Background and Rationale Castration-resistant prostate cancer represents a lethal transition in the progression of prostate cancer, with most patients ultimately succumbing to the disease. Prior to the recent approval of novel hormonal therapies (NHT) (enzalutamide, abiraterone acetate/prednisone),the only approved therapiesfor metastatic CRPC weredocetaxel, cabazitaxel and sipeleucel-T. The approval of NHTs in metastatic CRPC previously treated with docetaxel (De Bono et al, 2011; Scher et al, 2012) represented a therapeutic advance for these patients. Poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase 1(PARP1) and PARP2 play important roles in DNA repair(Schreiber et al, 2006; Curtin, 2005). Inhibition of PARP catalytic activity results in synthetic lethality whereby persistent single-strand DNA breaks lead to irreparable double-strand DNA breaks in cells with defective homologous recombination mechanisms. Moreover, PARP inhibitors also trap the PARP enzyme on DNA to a variable extent, including that of tumor cells, thereby preventing DNA replication and transcription. Talazoparib is a potent, orally bioavailable, small molecule PARP inhibitor in development for the treatment of a variety of human cancers. Single-agent treatment with talazoparib demonstrates potent antitumor effects in tissue culture studies, mouse tumor xenograft models, and in Phase1studies in patients with solid tumors. Talazoparib has also been shown to enhance the cytotoxic effects of DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Talazoparib in preclinical models demonstrates potent cytotoxic effects from PARP trapping. Proof of concept that a PARP inhibitor may treat advanced metastatic CRPC with DNA damage repair deficiency was established in a Phase2study (TOPARP-A) with olaparib, which enrolled men heavily pre-treated with taxane-based chemotherapy and NHT(Mateo et al, 2015). Thus, the current study was designed given the results of TOPARP-A forthe treatment of late stage metastatic CRPC for which there are no approved treatments tested in the target population ofthis study. Objectives Primary Objective:  To evaluate the efficacyof single agent talazoparib in DNA damage repair (DDR) +metastatic CRPC, as measured by best objective response rate (ORR). Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate efficacy with respect to the following parameters:  Time to objective response;  Duration of response;  Proportion of patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)decrease 50%;  Proportion of patients with conversion of circulating tumor cell (CTC) count;  Time to PSA progression;  Radiographic progression-free survival (PFS);  Overall survival.  Toevaluate the safety of talazoparib in this patient population.  To evaluate the following patient-reported outcomes:  Time to deterioration in painas assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF);  Change from baseline in pain per BPI-SF;  Change from baseline in general health statusas assessed by the European Quality of Life 5-Domain 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L).  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of talazoparib. CCI STUDY DESIGN This is an international, phase 2, open-label, soft tissueresponse rate study of talazoparib (also known as PF-06944076, MDV3800, BMN 673), a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor in development for treatment of cancer. PARP inhibition has been shown to produce clinical responses in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), particularly in patients with DNA damage repair deficiencies. PARP inhibitors are thought to induce cell toxicity by inhibiting PARP catalytic activity as well as by trapping"
" atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that can cause many symptoms, such as itching, redness, and a rash that is scaling or oozing. the symptoms can look different on different people. atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema. there is no known cure for this condition. people with atopic dermatitis often have this condition for many years, and may have flare ups, when their symptoms worsen for a time. researchers are looking for treatments for atopic dermatitis. crisaborole is a medicine that is used to treat atopic dermatitis. it is applied to the skin as an ointment. crisaborole may improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis by decreasing inflammation in the skin. inflammation is the bodys immune system response, which can lead to symptoms such as redness. the main goal of this study was to learn more about how crisaborole works by taking skin samples to analyze for biomarkers, which are special substances in the skin related to inflammation. researchers wanted to answer these main questions:  did atopic dermatitis biomarkers change in areas of skin that were treated with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin that were treated with plain ointment?  did symptoms of atopic dermatitis improve in areas of skin that were treated with crisaborole, compared to areas of skin that were treated with plain ointment? "," Background and Rationale: Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory, highly pruritic, chronic eczematous condition that usually occurs in people who have a personal or family history of other atopic conditions such as asthma or allergic rhinitis.1,6 The majority of patients (up to 90%) with AD present with mild to moderate disease7 Manifestation of the disease includes intense pruritus, erythematous papules, excoriation, exudation, and lichenification.8 Continuous scratching during exacerbations can lead to lichenification, excoriations, and serious skin infections. AD is often associated with significant morbidity, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Currently, there is no cure for AD. AD is a chronic disease with treatment focused on the management of flares and maintenance of remissions. Crisaborole, also referred to as PF-06930164 and AN2728, is a low molecular weight benzoxaborole anti-inflammatoryphosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor that is expected to penetrate into the skin to the sites of inflammation. PDE-4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. The specific mechanism(s) bywhich crisaborole exerts its therapeutic action is not well defined, but it is thought that crisaborole reduces the production of several pro-inflammatorycytokines implicated in the pathophysiologyof atopic dermatitis (AD). Supporting evidence of the safety and efficacy of crisaborole in subjects 2years and older represent a major advancement in the treatment of AD given the challenges of managing this common, chronic dermatologic condition and the treatment-limiting effects of currently available therapies. All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant in the two Phase3 registration studies. Across the Phase3 development program, crisaborole demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, with no crisaborole treatment-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)and with the majority of Adverse Events (AEs)being mild anddeemed unlikely or not related to investigational product. Objectives and Endpoints Primary Objective(s):  To evaluate the efficacy of crisaborole ointment 2% vs vehicle in subjects with mild to moderate AD.  To evaluate change in key skin biomarkers of AD in target lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle. Secondary Objective(s):  To evaluate change in other skin biomarkers of atopic dermatitis in target lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle. treated with crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle.  To evaluate changes in AD clinical sign and symptom severity in target lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle.  To assess the safety and local tolerability of crisaborole ointment 2% in subjects with mild to moderate AD.

" nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is a condition where there is a high amount of fat in the liver in people who drink few alcoholic drinks or do not drink alcoholic drinks. the liver is an organ in the body that cleans the blood. if not treated, nafld can cause damage to the liver and develop into a more serious condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash). in nash, the liver contains a high amount of fat, is inflamed or swollen, and/or scarred. this condition may be described as a stiff liver. if not treated, nash can worsen and, in some people, the liver may stop working and a liver transplant could be needed. pf-05221304 is a new investigational drug that is being studied to see if it could be used in the future to treat people with nash. an investigational drug is one that is not approved for sale in this country where the clinical study is taking place. this study looked at different doses (or amounts) of pf-05221304 to see what happens to the amount of fat in the liver after treatment. this study should help decide what dose of pf-05221304 could be used in future clinical studies in nash. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: The current study is the first clinical trial proposed with PF-05221304 in adult subjects with NAFLD.

" what is ulcerative colitis? ulcerative colitis (uc) is a long-term inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. uc affects the mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. people with uc experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as active disease or flares. these periods of active disease are characterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and presence of blood in the stools, as well as sense of urgency. active disease is often followed by periods of remission (time with no symptoms) that vary in length from weeks to years. there is no known cure for uc. treatment can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of uc and can even lead to long-term remission. medication is the most common treatment for uc and biologic therapies like infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are often used. a biologic therapy is a treatment that has been developed from a natural source, such as a component found in the body, but then updated in the laboratory so that it can be used to treat a disease. biologics are usually produced using biotechnology methods. some people do not respond to these biologics or the treatment can stop working after a while. other medicines that can be used with the biologic therapy are needed. what is pf-06687234? at the time this study started, pf-06687234 was an experimental treatment being developed for people with uc that could be used with infliximab. pf-06687234 is given by a subcutaneous injection weekly. subcutaneous means the injection is given under the skin. this study was the first time pf-06687234 was used in participants with uc. this study was stopped early after the researchers looked at data and saw that pf-06687234 was not working as well as they hoped. what was the purpose of this study? researchers did this study to learn if pf-06687234 could help participants with uc achieve remission as well as if this treatment was safe. researchers wanted to know:  did the participants taking pf-06687234 and infliximab achieve remission?  is treatment with pf-06687234 safe and well tolerated? ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: Pfizer has exclusively in-licensed F8IL10 (Dekavil) from Philogen S.pA., Siena, Italy, for  development in inflammatory disorders. In nonclinical or clinical studies sponsored by  Philogen or conducted using Philogen manufactured material, the product is identified as  F8IL10. In nonclinical and clinical studies conducted by or for Pfizer using Pfizer  manufactured material, the investigational product is identified as PF-06687234. PF-06687234 is comparable to F8IL10. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine with wide-ranging effects on the anti and  pro-inflammatory functions of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.  IL-10 can enhance T regulatory cell function, block dendritic cell maturation, and induce  down-regulation of Th1 cytokines and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II  antigens, and increase B cell survival, proliferation, and antibody production. At the  molecular level, IL-10 can modulate the NF-B and janus kinase signal transducers and  activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathways. A critical role for IL-10 in  inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathophysiology is strongly supported by human genetics,  as complete loss of IL10, IL10RA and IL10RB results in severe early onset IBD.4  Taken  together, IL-10-based therapies could have significant utility in treatment of IBD. PF-06687234 is a fully human single chain variable fragment (scFv)-cytokine fusion protein  consisting of the scFv F8 (specific to the Extra-Domain A of fibronectin, selectively expressed in newly formed blood vessels during inflammatory responses) fused to the  anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. PF-06687234 is designed to enrich IL-10 delivery to  inflamed tissues, potentially leading to higher local concentrations, greater clinical efficacy,  and decreased systemic toxicity and is currently being investigated in subjects with ulcerative  colitis (UC).

" streptococcus pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections of the lung (pneumonia), brain lining (meningitis), blood (bacteremia), or ear (otitis). these infections may be very serious in young children and older adults. streptococcus pneumoniae is also known as s. pneumoniae or pneumococcus. currently there are 100 known types of s. pneumoniae. this study is about a vaccine called the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or 20vpnc. a vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight off germs. 20vpnc may help to prevent infections caused by s. pneumoniae. it is called 20-valent because 20vpnc prevents 20 of the most common types of s. pneumoniae. 20vpnc is an investigational vaccine and it was not approved for general use at the time of this study. after a vaccine is injected into a persons body, the body responds to help fight infections and prevent diseases. the response to vaccines includes making antibodies, which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent diseases. in the united states, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or 13vpnc, is currently approved for preventing s. pneumoniae diseases in children and adults. 13vpnc is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 13 types of s. pneumoniae. 20vpnc has the same components found in 13vpnc, plus 7 additional components that may widen protection. the pneumovax 23 vaccine, or ppsv23, is made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 23 types of s. pneumoniae. the main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of 20vpnc in participants aged between 60 and 64 years. the researchers wanted to know if any of the participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site after they were given the vaccine. the researchers also wanted to know about participants who had a fever, felt tired, had headaches, muscle pains, and/or pain in the joints or took medicine for pain or fever after the vaccination. ","protocol summary background and rationale streptococcus pneumoniaeare gram-positive encapsulated cocci that have beenaleading cause of bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (aom) and continue to be a major global public health concern. serious pneumococcal disease may occur at any age; however, children <5 years and adults 65 years of age are at particularly increased risk. individuals with certain comorbidities and immunocompromising conditions are also at risk. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) data estimated that in 2015there were 29,500 cases and 3350 deaths due to invasive pneumococcal disease (ipd) in the united states. in 2008, the world health organization (who) estimated that 1.6million people die from pneumococcal disease each year. spneumoniae remains an important cause of serious disease in the united states and worldwide. the polysaccharide capsule has been identified as an important virulence factor for this pathogen. while more than 95 pneumococcal serotypes differentiated by their capsular polysaccharide compositionhave been identified, only a subset of serotypes aremore commonly associated with severe disease. pneumococcal disease can be prevented with polysaccharide-based vaccines that induce antibody responses with functional (opsonophagocytic) activity and target the capsular serotypes responsible for disease. pneumococcal vaccines, such as the licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (ppsv23), containing free polysaccharides for23 pneumococcal serotypes, elicit a t-cellindependent immune response. these vaccines are poorly immunogenic for many of the serotypes contained in the vaccine in children less than 2 years of age, immunocompromised populations, and older adults. they do not induce memory responses in any population, and have limited or no protection against nonbacteremic disease, including community-acquired pneumonia (cap). pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which contain capsular polysaccharides covalently linked to a protein carrier, elicit a t-celldependent immune response inducing protective responses in young children, older adults, and populations with high-risk conditions. prevnar (7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), which was licensed in the united states in 2000, and prevnar 13 (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [13vpnc]), which was licensed in the united states in 2010, are pneumococcal conjugate vaccines containing 7 and 13, respectively,pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides individually conjugated tocross-reactive material 197 (crm ), a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin. 197 these vaccines target serotypes that caused the majorityof pneumococcal disease in infants and older adultsat the time of their introduction. they have demonstrated efficacy/effectiveness against vaccine-type (vt) ipd, aom, and pneumoniaandthe ability to reduce nasopharyngeal carriage and transmission, resulting in indirect beneficial effects. pfizer is developing a new 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vpnc) candidate to further expand protection against the global burden of vaccine-preventable pneumococcal disease in children and adults over that of prevnar 13. 20vpnc has the same composition as prevnar 13, but contains an additional 7 pneumococcal conjugates toprotect against serotypes responsible for a substantial burden of remaining pneumococcal disease. 20vpnc uses the same platform as prevnar and prevnar 13 and contains components that have undergone extensive clinical research. a phase 1 studyis beingconducted in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age to support further development of 20vpnc. the purpose of the proposed phase 2 study in older adults is to generate a safety and immunogenicity dataset with 20vpnc to support and inform the design of the phase 3 clinical development program for adults. study design this is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind study with a 2-arm parallel design. a total of 440 adults 60 through 64 years of age with no history of pneumococcal vaccination will be enrolled and randomized equally to receive an initial vaccination with either:  a single dose of 20vpnc followed 1 month later by saline (placebo) administration in the active vaccinegroup (20vpnc/saline group), or  a single dose of 13vpnc followed 1 month later by a dose of ppsv23 in the control group(13vpnc/ppsv23 group). 13vpnc will serve as a control for safety, as well as immunogenicity of the 13 serotypes in common with 20vpnc. ppsv23 will serve as a control for immunogenicity of the 7 additional serotypes (8, 10a, 11a, 12f, 15b, 22f, and 33f) in 20vpnc. blood samples will be collected on the day of investigational product administrationprior to each study vaccination(vaccination 1 and vaccination 2), 1 month after vaccination2, and 12 months after vaccination 1for immunogenicity assessments. prompted local reactions at the injection site and prompted systemic events will be coll"
" atopic dermatitis (or ad), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a common skin disorder that causes patches of flaky, red, and very itchy skin. ad occurs in 15%-30% of children and 10% of adults in the united states. some of the current medicines available for ad can only be used for short time periods, or can cause other health problems. researchers are looking for new treatments for ad that can be taken for long periods of time. while researchers think that many things cause ad, it is made worse by the bodys immune system (the bodys defense against infection) causing redness and swelling (inflammation). cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special proteins called cytokines. researchers think that medicines that lower the amount of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with ad. the drug tested in this study was pf-04965842, which now has the generic name abrocitinib. pf-04965842 is an experimental drug that has not been approved for sale yet. pf-04965842 blocks the activity of a protein called janus kinase 1, which acts like an on/off switch for the cells of the immune system. by turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines that are believed to make ad worse. the researchers wanted to ask,  are patients who take pf-04965842 more likely to have their ad improve compared to patients who are treated with a placebo? to do this, researchers used 2 different tests to measure the severity of each patients ad at the beginning of the study. the researchers measured the severity of ad during 12 weeks of study treatment. the difference in severity was used to decide if a patients ad had improved or not. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale:  Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a common, chronic, inflammatory  skin disorder characterized by flaky skin lesions, intense pruritus, and a general deterioration  in the quality of life. Over the past 50 years, AD has become more prevalent, especially in  industrialized, temperate countries such as the United States (US).1,2  Earlier reports indicated  that, in up to 70% of cases, the disease greatly improves or resolves until late childhood,  however more recent findings suggest that disease activity remains manifest for a prolonged  period of time. Based on a total of 7157 patients enrolled in the Pediatric Eczema Elective  Registry (PEER) study, comprising a total of 22,550 person-years, it was concluded that  symptoms associated with AD seem to persist well into the second decade of a childs life  and likely longer.3  At every age, more than 80% of PEER study subjects had symptoms of  AD and/or were using medication to treat their AD. There are a limited number of treatments available for AD. Current treatments for AD  include emollients, topical corticosteroids (eg, betamethasone, clobetasol, fluocinonide),  topical calcineurin inhibitors (eg, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus), and coal tar preparations.  Crisaborole was approved as a topical treatment in December 2016 by the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) for use in patients with mild to moderate AD. Additional treatments  generally reserved for severe AD include phototherapy (eg, ultraviolet A light [UVA] with or  without psoralen, ultraviolet B light [UVB] narrowband or broadband) and systemic agents  (eg, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-), mycophenolate  mofetil, methotrexate [MTX], azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin).4  Of the currently  available therapies, none offers a cure; therefore, the main aims of existing treatments are to  reduce the occurrence of acute flares, to increase the time between relapses, and to reduce  pruritus and the resulting sleep disturbance.5,6 Other systemic agents to treat AD are under clinical development or recently approved.  Dupilumab, an injectable human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL) -4 and  -13, was approved by the FDA in March 2017 and received marketing authorization in  Europe in September 2017, and offers a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of  moderate to severe AD. However, the approved dosing for dupilumab as an initial dose of  2 x 300 mg subcutaneous injections followed by 300 mg every other week injections may  limit the desirability of this route of treatment. Key cytokines implicated in the pathophysiology of AD include IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-31,  and IFN-, require Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) for signal transduction; this suggests that selective  JAK1 inhibitors that modulate the activity of these cytokines represent a compelling approach to the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.7 PF-04965842 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that selectively inhibits JAK1 by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. PF-04965842 has a high degree of  selectivity against other kinases: 28-fold selectivity over JAK2, >340-fold over JAK3 and  43-fold over tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), as well as a good selectivity profile over the broader  range of human kinases. The selective inhibition of JAK1 will lead to modulation ofmultiple cytokine pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AD, including  IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-31 and IFN-. Data from a Phase 2b proof of concept (POC) study  (B7451006) that evaluated subjects with moderate to severe AD have shown positive  efficacy, as well as an acceptable safety profile, sufficient to support further clinical  development in a larger Phase 3 program. Objectives and Endpoints:  Primary Objective  To assess the efficacy of PF-04965842 compared with placebo in subjects aged  12 years and older with moderate to severe AD.  Secondary Objective  To evaluate the effect of PF-04965842 on additional efficacy endpoints and  patient-reported outcomes over time in subjects aged 12 years and older with  moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Safety Objective  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-04965842 in subjects aged 12 years and  older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis following 12 weeks of treatment. Pharmacokinetic Objective   To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-04965842 in subjects aged 12 years and  older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis following 12 weeks of treatment. Endpoints Primary Endpoints:   Response based on the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) score of clear (0) or  almost clear (1) (on a 5-point scale) and a reduction from baseline of 2 points at  Week 12. The baseline will be defined as the IGA score on Day 1 pre-dose;  Response based on the Eczema Area and Severity Index 75% improvement from  baseline (EASI-75) response at Week 12. The baseline will be defined as the EASI  score on Day 1 pre-dose.  Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:   Response based on at least 4 points improvement in the severity of pruritus numerical  rating scale (NRS) from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 12;   Change from Baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis  (PSAAD) total score at Week 12.

" hemophilia is a disease that is inherited, which means it runs in families, and while girls and women can have it too, it mainly affects boys and men. people with hemophilia have problems with their blood not clotting. after an injury, someone with hemophilia will bruise more easily and, if cut, will bleed for longer, but not faster. sometimes bleeding can happen inside the body and this internal bleeding can lead to serious problems. people with hemophilia have low amounts of one of two proteins called factor viii and factor ix. when that protein that is essential to clotting is either missing or doesnt work properly, they are diagnosed with hemophilia. people with low factor viii have hemophilia a, while people with low factor ix have hemophilia b. doctors prescribe medicines called factor replacement therapy to help the blood clot in people with hemophilia. these treatments work by replacing clotting factors viii or ix. people with hemophilia a have the option of using hemlibra, which is treatment for factor viii replacement. some people cannot be treated with factor replacement therapy for long amounts of time as the body can develop inhibitors that stop the treatment from working. thus other types of treatments are needed to help people with hemophilia. another way hemophilia may be treated is to stop the protein called tissue factor pathway inhibitor (tfpi). tfpi acts like a brake and slows the clotting of blood. marstacimab (pf-06741086) is a new type of treatment known as a monoclonal antibody. monoclonal antibodies are copies of certain proteins found in the body that can help treat different conditions. marstacimab works by attaching to tfpi, which removes the brake and lets the blood clot in people with hemophilia a and b with or without inhibitors. marstacimab is given as a subcutaneous injection with a needle just underneath the skin. the medicine eventually enters the bloodstream and is carried around the body where it may help to prevent or reduce the number of bleeding episodes. the purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety of marstacimab at different doses in participants with severe hemophilia. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Study B7841003is a Phase2,open-label study in subjects with severe he mophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors to Factor VIII ( F VIII) or Factor I X ( FI X). This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of long-ter m prophylaxis with P F-06741086, a monoclonal antibody that targets tissue factor path way inhibitor ( T F PI).

" what is acute myeloid leukemia? acute myeloid leukemia is also known as aml and is a common cancer of the blood. aml starts when myeloid cells in the bone marrow begin to grow out of control. the bone marrow is the soft inner part of certain bones, and it is where new blood cells are made. the myeloid cells would normally develop into red blood cells, certain types of white blood cells, and platelets. red blood cells are used to carry oxygen from the lungs around the body to where it is needed. these red blood cells also take carbon dioxide back to the lungs so it can be breathed out. white blood cells are used to fight infections. platelets help to stop bleeding when blood vessels are damaged. while aml starts in the bone marrow, it often spreads to other areas of the body. what is glasdegib? this study investigated the use of glasdegib, which is new type of treatment known as a hedgehog or smoothened (smo) inhibitors. glasdegib is designed to reduce or stop the growth of cancer cells. at the time this study began, glasdegib was an investigational (or experimental) drug. an investigational drug is one that is not approved for sale in the country where it is being used. during this study, the us food and drug administration (fda) gave their approval for glasdegib to be used with low dose cytarabine to treat newly diagnosed aml. this was in november 2018. the european medicines agency (ema) gave their approval in june 2020. glasdegib is sold in these countries as daurismo. the other treatments used in this study are cytarabine, daunorubicin, and azacitidine. these are all licensed cancer treatments for aml and are often described as chemotherapy. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this research study is to compare the effects of the study drug, glasdegib, with a placebo, to find out how well glasdegib worked in combination with chemotherapy to help participants live longer. two different types of chemotherapy were tested in this study:  intensive chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin. these treatments are often used to treat patients with aml in the us and europe, but this type of chemotherapy is quite aggressive. this means the medicines are strong and quite toxic and not all patients with aml are suitable for this intensive chemotherapy.  standard chemotherapy with azacitidine. this is one of the medicines used to treating patients with aml in the us and europe if the patient is not suitable for intensive chemotherapy. researchers wanted to know: did the participants taking glasdegib with chemotherapy live longer compared to participants not taking glasdegib? ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Indications Glasdegib is being studied in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of adult patients  with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are not candidates for  intensive induction chemotherapy (Non-intensive AML population). Glasdegib is being studied in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin for the treatment  of adult patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (Intensive AML population).  Background and Rationale Glasdegib is a selective, orally administered inhibitor of smoothened (SMO), which  demonstrates potent and selective inhibition of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in vitro and  significant antitumor efficacy in vivo. The Hh signaling pathway regulates cell  differentiation and self-renewal in the developing embryo, and is typically silenced in adult  tissues. Aberrant Hh signaling may result from mutations in key pathway genes,  non-mutational mechanisms related to the secretion of Hh ligands, or from cells in the tumor  microenvironment. Aberrant Hh signaling has been identified in a variety of human  leukemia and leukemic stem cells (LSCs).1-3 Upregulation of Hh pathway components has  been observed in chemo resistant AML cell lines in vitro, and pharmacological inhibition of  the Hh pathway resulted in decreased multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR-1) or P-glycoprotein  (P-gp) expression in these cells.4  The SMO inhibitors, vismodegib (Erivedge ) 5 and  sonidegib (Odomzo ) 6 have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the treatment of  patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma. Glasdegib is being developed for indications in  myeloid malignancies. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous cancer of the hematopoietic system characterized by increased blast counts, pancytopenias causing infections and bleeding, and  reduced survival. AML is characterized by multiple genetic mutations at the time of  diagnosis that evolve with treatment, resulting in treatment resistance, disease relapse, and reduced survival. It is estimated that there will be 21,380 new cases and 10,590 deaths from  AML in the United States (US) in 2017. 7 Incidence rates in Europe are similar to rates in the  United States.8  AML is a disease of older people and is uncommon before the age of 45.  The average age of a patient with AML is about 67 years.  Existing standards of care, such as anthracycline + cytarabine or hypomethylating agents like  decitabine and azacitidine, can induce complete remissions in 5-70% of patients; however,  remissions are not durable and disease relapse occurs in up to 60% of patients.9  For AML patients unable to receive intensive chemotherapy, existing standard treatments like low-dose  cytarabine (LDAC) are associated with response rates <20% and median overall survival  (mOS) times of 5-6.5 months. Hypomethylating agents, although not approved in the US specifically for AML, have shown improved overall survival (OS) vs LDAC in AML patients  not suitable for intensive chemotherapy. Midostaurin (Rydapt ) is indicated for use in  combination with standard 7+3 cytarabine and daunorubicin induction, and with cytarabine  consolidation therapy, for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who are FLT3 mutation-positive. Approval in 2017 was based on the Phase III RATIFY (Cancer and  Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 10603) clinical trial resulting in a 23% reduction in the risk of  death compared with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval  [CI], 0.63, 0.95; 2 sided p=0.016). 10  Event-free survival (EFS) was significantly higher for  Rydapt plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone (EFS median of 8.2 months compared  to 3.0 months, HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.66, 0.93 and 2 sided p=0.004). The most frequent  adverse events (AEs) were febrile neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, headache,  musculoskeletal pain, petechiae, device-related infection, epistaxis, hyperglycemia and upper  respiratory tract infections.  Reducing the incidence of disease progression to prolong survival remains the highest unmet  medical need in the treatment of AML patients.11-13 Glasdegib has shown activity in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML with improved  response rates and improved OS. In the safety lead-in cohort of the B1371012 study, 12 patients with previously untreated  intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS (n=7) AML with 20-30% blastsand multi-linage dysplasia  (n=3), erythroleukemia (n=1) or CMML (n=1) were treated with glasdegib in combination  with azacitidine. Patients were treated for a median 94.0 days. One patient had a glasdegib  dose reduction 98 days after start of treatment. As of March 2017, 5 out of the 12 patients responded. 3 patients with CR (all AML) and 2 patients with marrow CR. 14 The number of  CRs observed with glasdegib and azacitidine appears favorable in the context of the  15-17% CR rate seen with azacitidine alone. In the randomized Phase 2 cohort of Study B1371003, patients with previously untreated  AML or high-risk MDS who were not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy using  established criteria15 were stratified into good/intermediate risk vs poor risk by genetics and  were randomized 2:1 to receive in an open-label fashion, LDAC + glasdegib vs LDAC alone.  In AML patients (78 and 38 randomized to LDAC + glasdegib and LDAC, respectively),  mOS for LDAC + glasdegib was 8.3 vs 4.3 months for LDAC alone (and OS HR=0.463,  with p-value=0.0002) with 94 observed deaths. Glasdegib has demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS when combined with LDAC vs  LDAC alone in elderly AML patients not suitable for intensive chemotherapy, with no new  significant safety signals identified to date in a prospective randomized trial. In the ongoing single-arm Phase 2 cohort of Study B1371003, patients with previously untreated AML or high-risk MDS received intensive chemotherapy (7+3) in combination  with glasdegib in an open-label fashion. The 7+3 regimen consists of 7 days of cytarabine  and 3 days of daunorubicin. Based on investigators assessment, CR rate for AML patients  was 47% (80% CI 38.3-55.6) and Complete Remission/Complete remission with incomplete  hematologic recovery (CR/CRi) rate was 55% (80% CI 46.7-62.7). The mOS for AML pts  (n=64) was 16.3 months with 37 observed deaths. "
" what is breast cancer? breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. in 2012, about 1.7 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer and over 522,000 women died due to the disease. some people carry changes or mutations in their dna in genes called breast cancer susceptibility (brca) genes 1 and 2, or brca1 and brca2. brca gene mutations can be inherited by a child from one of their parents (germline). when a persons brca1 or brca2 genes contain mutations, it can cause breast cancer. researchers are looking for treatments for breast cancer patients with brca mutations. what is talazoparib? talazoparib (talzenna) is known as a parp inhibitor. parp inhibitors are drugs that are believed to inhibit (stop) the normal activity of certain proteins called poly (adp-ribose) polymerases, also called parps. parps are proteins (made from genes which are part of dna) that are found in all normal and cancer cells that are involved in the repair of dna. parps are needed to repair mistakes that can happen in dna when cells divide. if the mistakes are not repaired, the cell will usually die and be replaced. cells with mistakes in their dna (like cells with brca1 and brca2 gene mutations) that do not die can become cancer cells. clinical trials have shown that the use of talazoparib, as well as other parp inhibitors, may reduce tumor size and slow tumor growth in patients with certain types of cancer with brca1 or brca2 mutations. talazoparib is given in a capsule and is taken by mouth once daily at around the same time every day. what was the purpose of this study? talazoparib is now approved in the united states, the european union, and other countries for the treatment of people with a certain type of breast cancer (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [her2]-negative), who have an abnormal inherited brca gene, and their cancer has spread beyond the original tumor (locally advanced) or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). this study was done to see if talazoparib treatment followed by surgery could result in a pathologic complete response (complete disappearance of cancer in the breast or underarm lymph node tissues at surgery) in participants with early breast cancer (original location) who have inherited a brca1 or brca2 gene mutation in her2 negative breast cancer. researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of talazoparib. they monitored the participants for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study. researchers wanted to know: how many participants had a pathologic complete response (complete disappearance of cancer at surgery) after 24 weeks of treatment with talazoparib followed by surgery? "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Overview Talazoparib (also known as PF-06944076, MDV3800, BMN 673) is being investigated for the treatment of germline breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2, (gBRCA1/2), mutation-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. Background and Rationale Breast cancer is a biologically diverse and genetically heterogeneous disease.1,2 Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1(BRCA1) and breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2)are key components in the repair pathway for deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) double strand breaks,3 and mutations in these genes account for 20% to 25% of hereditary breast cancers and 5% of all breast cancers.4 A substantial portion of patients with gBRCA mutated breast cancer have hormone receptor-positive disease, including 2030% of gBRCA1 carriers and 45 72% of gBRCA2 carriers.5 Approximately 15% of all breast cancers are triple negative. They can be defined by the lack of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. They are more commonly associated with younger women, pre-menopausal women of African American race and BRCA1 mutation carriers. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are generally more aggressive in nature and associated with visceral and soft tissue disease. The incidence of BRCA1 and 2 mutations in patients with TNBC has been reported to be between 9.6 to 10.6%.6,7 In a study of 469TNBC patients, gBRCA1/2 mutation prevalence was also shown to vary by race: Ashkenazi Jewish (50 %), Caucasian (33.3 %), Asian (28.5%), African Americans (20.4%),and Hispanic (20 %). The prevalence of genetic mutations also differed by age at diagnosis, with most patients <40 years (43.8 %) of age. Various studies have demonstrated that TNBCs are associated with a poorer prognosis than luminal breast cancers. A Canadian series, including approximately 1600 triple negative cancers conducted by Dent, R et al8 demonstrated worse long term outcomes in terms of distant recurrence and death in triple negative tumors compared to non-triple negative tumors. The standard of treatment for neoadjuvant treatment is variable, but mostly focuses on the use of anthracycline-taxane regimens. Other regimens used include adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC). Cyclophosphamide methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) is another option which offers less toxicity; however, it has a longer duration of therapy. Platinum therapies have also shown efficacyin HER2 negative breast cancer, in particular germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (gBRCA) mutant tumors, as these tumors have defects in homologous recombination (hR), rendering them more susceptible to deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) cross linking agents such as platinums. Retrospective neoadjuvant subject series have suggested that primary breast cancer in BRCA1 carriers is platinum- sensitive and relatively unresponsive to anthracyclines and/or taxanes9 while other studies have found that BRCA1 is relatively responsive to anthracyclines and/or taxanes while BRCA2 disease is less responsive than sporadic primary breast cancer to these drug classes.10 The GeparSixto (NCT01426880) and CALGB (NCT00632853) trials examined the efficacy of adding platinum to neoadjuvant regimens in triple negative breast cancer. In GeparSixto, the pathological complete response (pCR) rates (breast/axilla) increased from36.9% to 53.2%; in the BRCA subgroup, an increase in pCR by 25% (probability value [p]=0.008) was observed. The CALGB/Alliance trial showed an increase in pCR with the addition of carboplatin for breast/axilla (54% vs 41%; p=0.0029). Since these studies were underpowered for long term outcome, it is difficult to assess long term benefit. Therefore, the role for platinum therapy in TNBC still remains unclear and warrants further investigation in larger trials with examination of long term outcomes. There have been studies resulting in improved disease-free survival (DFS) in patients who achieved pCR with platinum agents and BRCA mutation. Frasci et al11 reported that in TNBC patients treated with eight cisplatin-epirubicin-paclitaxel weekly cycles, 62%showed pCR in both breast and axilla, and the projected 5-year DFS was 90%and 56%in pCRs and non-pCRs, respectively. The BRCA1 gene is expressed in several tissues, such as breast and ovarian tissue. Currently, more than 1600 mutations have been identified in the BRCA1 gene, and the majority of them promote frameshifts resulting in missense or non-functional protein. Women with BRCA1 mutations have an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, while men have a higher risk, to a lesser extent, of developing prostate cancer.12 BRCA2 does not share a high degree of sequence homology with other known genes, and the generated protein is comprised of regions with domains that are undefined.13 Currently, more than 1800 mutations have been identified in BRCA2, that include frameshift deletions, insertions, or nonsense mutations that lead to premature truncation of proteins. It has been demonstrated that BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes perform a critical role in the response to cellular damage through activation of specific DNA repair processes and play an important part in DNA repair and as transcriptional regulators.14 Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) catalytic activity contributes to the process of synthetic lethality-defined as a combination of two DNA repair pathway defects which may be lethal to the cell-resulting in single-strand breaks that require homologous recombination DNA repair for survival. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) induce synthetic lethality in tumor cells containing mutations and/or deletions in genes involved in homologous replication or other DNA pathways, including BRCA1 and BRCA2. Clinical trials have shown that PARPi are beneficial in the treatment of patients with breast cancer that are carriers of germline BRCA mutations. In a phase 1 trial, olaparib (NCT00516373; 10 to 600 mg twice a day) treatment of solid tumors of patients with breast cancer with no gBRCA mutations vs. patients with breast cancer with gBRCA mutations, resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 15% and 33%, respectively15in a phase2 trial (NCT00494234) of single-agent olaparib in patients with breast cancer with BRCA1/2 mutation and advanced disease, investigated two dose levels (cohort 1: 400 mg twice daily [bd] and cohort 2: 100mg bd) and demonstrated an ORR of42% and 25%, respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.7 and 3.8 months for cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. A phase I study of niraparib (NCT00749502; 30 to 400 mg once a day) for treatment of solid"
" ankylosing spondylitis (as) is a disease that can cause pain and swelling (inflammation) in the joints around the spine. this is because the immune system, whose job is to attack foreign invaders like viruses and other germs, mistakenly attacks the joints instead. patients with as may have pain and stiffness in the lower back, buttocks, or neck, along with mild fever and fatigue. there is no cure for as at this time, but common treatments for as include medicines that control pain, reduce inflammation, and prevent the immune system from attacking the joints. tofacitinib is an oral (taken by mouth) medicine that may reduce the activity of the immune system. it is being studied as a possible treatment for adults with as, but is not approved for this use outside of research studies like this one. in this study, researchers wanted to learn more about the use of tofacitinib in people who had not been helped by or could not tolerate other drugs for as, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) and/or tumor necrosis factor (tnf) inhibitors. researchers did this study to find out if tofacitinib, when compared to placebo, reduced as symptoms and improved a patients ability to perform physical activities (improved physical functioning). researchers wanted to answer this question:  does tofacitinib 5 mg given twice per day improve pain, inflammation, and physical functioning in patients with as who were not helped by other drugs, compared to placebo? ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is prevalent among spondyloarthropathies, a group of arthritic  conditions affecting the spine. This under recognized disease is often not diagnosed for  many years and typically presents in people between 20 and 40 years of age leading to  progressive disability and adverse effects on quality of life. Tofacitinib inhibits signaling of cytokines that are integral to lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and function and may thus  result in suppression of multiple aspects of the immune response. This forms the basis of the  rationale to investigate the effect of tofacitinib in active AS. This study is a follow-up to the A3921119 Phase 2b study of tofacitinib in active AS.

" respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is a virus that can cause an infection with symptoms that are similar to a bad cold, such as cough, fever, sore throat, and runny nose. this infection can be very serious in infants and young children. this study is about a vaccine called the respiratory syncytial virus stabilized prefusion f subunit vaccine, or rsvpref. a vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight off germs. rsvpref may be able to help prevent infections caused by rsv. rsvpref is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by rsv. this study is the first time this vaccine has been tested in people. to learn about the safety of this rsvpref vaccine, the researchers asked these questions:  what percentage of participants had local reactions (redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site) within 14 days after vaccination 1?  what percentage of participants had systemic events (nausea, headache, muscle pain, diarrhea, tiredness, joint pain, vomiting, or fever) within 14 days after vaccination 1?  what percentage of participants had medical problems within 1 month after vaccination 1?  what percentage of participants had serious medical problems or medical problems that required treatment from a doctor within 12 months after vaccination 1?  for some participants only, the researchers were also interested in the percentage of participants that had medical problems within 1 month after vaccination 2. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Indication The respiratory syncytial virus stabilized prefusion F subunit vaccine (RSV vaccine) is being developed for 2 indications:  Maternal:Prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract disease in infants by active immunization of pregnant women.  Older adult: Prevention of RSV-associated moderate to severe lower respiratory tract disease in adults 60 years of age and oldervia active immunization. Primary Objective: Primary Endpoints: To describe the safety and tolerability of an RSV Sentinel and expanded cohorts: vaccine given alone or concomitantly with seasonal  Local reactions within 14 days after inactivated influenzavaccine (SIIV). Vaccination1.  Systemic events within 14 days after Vaccination1.  Adverse events (AEs) within 1 month after Vaccination 1.  Medically attended AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) through 12 months after Vaccination 1. Expanded cohort:  AEs within 1 month after Vaccination 2. Study Design This is a Phase 1/2 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding first-in- human (FIH) study. The study will describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicityof up to 6 different RSV vaccine candidates CCI at 3 escalating dose levels of 60 gCCI 120 g CC and 240 gCCI I of the prefusion RSV F antigen, with or without aluminum hydroxide (Al[OH] ) 3 when administered alone or concomitantly with SIIV. This study will utilize a sentinel cohort (Phase 1) and an expanded cohort (Phase 2). The age groups will run in parallel. In the sentinel cohort (Phase 1), subjects willbe enrolled into 2 age groups:  Male and female subjects 18 to 49 years of age.  Male and female subjects 50 to 85 years of age. In the expanded cohort (Phase 2), subjects will be enrolled into 2 age groups:  Male and female subjects 18 to 49 years of age.  Male and female subjects 65 to 85 years of age. A single doseof RSV vaccine will be given to sentinel-cohort subjects to assess 3 escalating dose levels of the RSV vaccine candidate with or without Al(OH) . The first 4 subjects 3 vaccinated at the first site will be in the 18-to 49-year-old age group. These subjects must be observed by blinded site staff for at least 4 hours after vaccination for any acute reactions. Vaccination of the remaining subjects in both age groups will commence no sooner than 48hours after the fourth subject received his or hervaccination. The expanded cohort will assess the concomitant use of SIIV when given to subjects receiving 1 of 3 dose levels of the RSV vaccine candidate with or without Al(OH) .3 Subsequently, at approximately 12 months after Visit 1, selected subjects in the expanded cohort will be invited to participate in the revaccination stage. Subjects in the 240-g dose group who received an initial dose of theRSV vaccine with or without Al(OH) will be 3 revaccinatedwith the same dose and formulation of theRSV vaccine alone or concomitantly with SIIV. The SIIV or placebo assignment and the vaccination scheme will be the same as for the first year of the study. As a control, the placebo group will also be revaccinatedwith placeboaloneand thenfollowed by SIIV alone. Subjects will receive 2 intramuscular injections at Visit 7 and 1 intramuscular injection at Visit 8. The safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the second dosewill be evaluated. Inclusion Criteria Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study: 1. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document (ICD) indicating that the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study. 2. Healthy adults who are determined by medical history, physical examination, and clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in the study. Note:Healthy subjects with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, can be included. 3. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, vaccination plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures."
" the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vpnc) may help prevent pneumococcal disease caused by the bacteria, or germ, streptococcus pneumoniae. this germ is also known as s. pneumoniae, pneumococcus, or pneumococci. s. pneumoniae can spread from person to person through coughing and sneezing. sometimes the s. pneumoniae can cause pneumococcal disease. this can include infections in the ear and/or in the sinuses, which are the spaces in the bones behind the nose as well as more serious conditions such as meningitis or pneumonia. meningitis happens when s. pneumoniae infect the coverings around the brain and spinal cord, and pneumonia happens when the pneumococcal infection is in the lungs. when given the 13vpnc vaccine, a persons immune system makes antibodies against 13 different sugars in the vaccine. these sugars are like the ones found on the surface of s. pneumoniae, with a different sugar on the surface of each strain or type of s. pneumoniae. the immune system is what defends the body from germs like s. pneumoniae. antibodies are germ-fighting proteins that can recognize 13 common strains of s. pneumoniae that cause people to become sick. once the immune system recognizes the pneumococci, the immune system can then kill the pneumococci and stop an infection from developing in someone who has been vaccinated. this will only happen if the infection is caused by 1 of the 13 most common types of s. pneumoniae that the vaccine protects against. 13vpnc is a vaccine that has been approved for sale in many countries, including europe and japan where it is sold as prevenar 13 and the united states where it is known as prevnar 13. in japan, the 13vpnc vaccine can be given to infants and children under 6 years and to people who are aged 65 years and older. this vaccine is not currently licensed for use in people aged 6 to 64 years in japan. the researchers did this study to learn more about how this vaccine works in japanese people aged 6 to 64 years. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniaeis a major global public health concern. While the burden of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is predominantly borne by the very young, very old, and immunocompromised, manifestations of pneumococcal disease are a considerable cause of morbidity and mortality in all age groups. In Japan, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) was approved for children aged (cid:116)2 months to<6 years in 2013 and for adults aged (cid:116)65 years in 2014. 13vPnC has not been approved for individuals between the ages of 6 and 64 years in Japan,which is in contrast to the situation in the United States,countries in Europe,and many other countries globally where 13vPnC is approved for these ages. This situation is despite the fact that the 6- to 64-year age group has a not-insignificant proportion of individuals with underlying medical conditions who are considered to be at increased risk for developing pneumococcal disease (PD) based on the epidemiological data in Japan. Furthermore, the 5- to 64-year age group represented 27% of reported IPD cases in Japan in 2013,andmany IPD patients are individuals with underlying medical conditions. Pfizer-sponsored clinical studies conducted outside Japan in healthy individuals and in immunocompetent individuals with underlying stable medical conditions aged 6 years and older demonstrated that a single dose of 13vPnC was safe and well tolerated. In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of 13vPnC have been confirmed in overseas clinical studies involving immunocompromised populations, ie,subjects with sickle-cell disease (SCD), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects, and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Furthermore, more than 642 million doses of Prevenar 13(cid:147)/Prevnar 13(cid:147)(13vPnC) have been administered to individuals across the age spectrum globally and more than 15milliondoseshave been administered in Japan to children aged <6 years and adults aged (cid:116)65 years, without specificsafety concerns. Therefore,the unmet medical need for protection against PD that could be provided by 13vPnC, the large database of safety data from clinical studies in Japan and globally,and the extensive postmarketing experience support the conduct of the present study, Phase 3 StudyB1851172,in Japan. This study will assess the safety, tolerability,and immunogenicity of a single dose of 13vPnC in Japanese individuals aged 6 to 64 years who are considered to be at increased risk of pneumococcal diseaseand who are naive to pneumococcal vaccine. Final Protocol, 20March 2018 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Primary Objective: Primary Endpoints: (cid:120) To assess the safety and tolerability of a singledose of (cid:120) Number and proportion of subjects reporting local 13vPnC as measured by the incidence of local reactions, reactions (redness, swelling, pain at injection site) and systemic events, adverse events (AEs), and serious severity of the local reactions occurring within the adverse events (SAEs). 7-day period following study vaccination in the 6-to <18-year age group.

STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of single dose of 13vPnC in Japanese subjects aged 6 to 64 years who are considered to be at increased risk of pneumococcal disease and who are naive to pneumococcal vaccines. Approximate Duration of Subject Participation Subjects will participate in the study for approximately 1 month (29to 43days)."
" what is advanced cancer? this study looked at participants with different types of advanced cancer, including metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mpdac). pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pancreatic cancer. the pancreas is an organ located near the stomach that plays a role in the breakdown of food and helps to regulate blood sugar levels. cancer occurs when cells in the body divide without control, sometimes these cells form masses called tumours. cancer is called metastatic when it spreads to other parts of the body. metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to be cured or controlled with treatment. what are avelumab, binimetinib, and talazoparib? avelumab, binimetinib, and talazoparib are all medications made to help patients fight cancer in different ways. all three medications have been approved in the united states and europe for treating different types of cancer. avelumab is an intravenous (iv) cancer treatment, received at a clinic. binimetinib and talazoparib are both taken by mouth. researchers think that using combinations of these medications may help stop cancers from growing. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this study was to learn if combinations of avelumab, binimetinib, and talazoparib were safe for study participants with advanced cancer. all three drugs together had never been given before as a combination treatment. if the medications were safe, the researchers would then ask if participants with advanced cancer taking only 2 of the study medications or participants taking all 3 study medications saw their cancer get better. researchers wanted to know:  was there a combination of doses of avelumab and binimetinib or binimetinib and talazoparib that could be given safely for more studies in the future? ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY  Background and Rationale: Avelumab (MSB0010718C) is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Avelumab selectively binds to  PD-L1 and competitively blocks its interaction with programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1),  thereby interfering with this key immune checkpoint inhibition pathway. In March 2017,  avelumab received accelerated approval by the United States (US) Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) as the first approved treatment for metastatic merkel cell carcinoma  (MCC) followed by approvals in Japan, Australia, European Union, Switzerland, and Israel.  In May 2017, avelumab received accelerated approval by the US FDA for the treatment of  patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (UC) with disease progression  during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of neoadjuvant  or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy. In January 2018, avelumab was approved  for the same indication in Israel. Avelumab is currently being investigated as a single-agent  and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies in patients with locally advanced or  metastatic solid tumors and various hematological malignancies.  Binimetinib (MEK162) is an oral potent small molecule mitogen-activated protein kinase  kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor currently being developed by Array BioPharma for the treatment  of B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase (BRAF)-mutant melanoma (in  combination with encorafenib, a novel oral BRAF kinase inhibitor) and BRAF-mutant  colorectal cancer (CRC) (in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab). The US FDA  and European Medicines Agency approved the use of binimetinib and encorafenib for the  treatment of BRAF-mutant, unresectable or metastatic melanoma on 27 June 2018 and 20  September 2018, respectively. MEK is a key protein kinase in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK  signaling pathway, which regulates several key cellular activities including proliferation,  differentiation, migration, survival and angiogenesis. Inappropriate activation of this  pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers, particularly through mutations in BRAF  and RAS gene family members (including Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) and  neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS). Talazoparib (PF-06944076) is a potent, orally bioavailable poly (adenosine diphosphate  [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, which is cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines  harboring gene mutations that compromise deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair, an effect  referred to as synthetic lethality. Talazoparib is currently being investigated as a single-agent  and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies, including avelumab (Pfizer Study B9991025). In a Phase 3 trial in patients with breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)  -positive locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer (protocol no.  673-301 [EMBRACA]), single-agent talazoparib demonstrated superior progression-free  survival (PFS) versus physician choice chemotherapy.40  Median PFS was 8.6 months  (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.2, 9.3) for patients treated with talazoparib and 5.6 months  (95% CI: 4.2, 6.7) for those treated with chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR): 0.54 (95% CI:  0.41, 0.71), p<0.0001]. Based on this study, the US FDA and European Medicines Agency  approved the use of talazoparib for the treatment of adult patients with germline breast cancer  susceptibility gene (gBRCA)-mutated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer on 16 October 2018 and 20  June 2019, respectively.  Combinations of avelumab, binimetinib and talazoparib are expected to produce additive or  synergistic anti-tumor activity relative to each drug used as a single-agent. Studies suggest  that oncogenic RAS signaling upregulates PD-L1 expression via the MEK-extracellular  regulated signal kinase (ERK) pathway, 41,47 and that inhibition of MEK in combination with  checkpoint blockade promotes T-cell and anti-tumor activity. 42  Consistent with this, the  combination of binimetinib with an anti-PD-1 antibody improved anti-tumor activity and  survival as compared to single-agent controls in a KRAS-mutant tumor model.43  Emerging  data also indicate that the combination of PARP and MEK inhibition has synergistic antitumor activity. Combined treatment with the PARP inhibitor talazoparib and MEK inhibitor  selumetinib induces synergistic cytotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo in multiple RAS-mutant  tumor models across tumor lineages where RAS mutations are prevalent.44  The effects of the  combination are independent of BRCA1/2 and p53 mutation status, suggesting that the  synergistic activity is likely to be generalizable. In conclusion, the above rationale supports the clinical investigation of combinations of  PD-L1, MEK, and PARP inhibition in patients with locally advanced or metastatic KRAS- or  NRAS-mutant tumors where there are few effective therapeutic options.  The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and early signs of efficacy of  combinations of avelumab, binimetinib and talazoparib in patients with metastatic pancreatic  ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) and other locally advanced or metastatic KRAS- or  NRAS-mutant solid tumors. The combinations to be studied include avelumab and  binimetinib, binimetinib and talazoparib, and all 3 study drugs combined. The primary tumor  type of interest for this study - mPDAC - was selected based on the high frequency of RAS  mutations in this tumor type, 39,46 as well as an unmet medical need which is foreseen to  continue into the future. Given the high frequency of KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer (ie, over 90%), 39,46 these patients will not be preselected based on KRAS/NRAS mutation  status. Study Objectives and Endpoints: Primary Objectives  Phase 1b: To assess the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of the doublet and triplet  combinations in patients with mPDAC in order to determine the recommended  Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combinations.  Phase 2: To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of the doublet and triplet combinations based on the Investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria  in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in patients with mPDAC and other  KRAS- or NRAS-mutant advanced solid tumors.

" what is vitiligo? vitiligo is a chronic skin disorder that causes a patchy loss of skin color. this loss of skin color could be focused in one area of the body for some people (called segmental vitiligo) or could be located over various areas of the body for other people (called non-segmental vitiligo). melanin is the name for a pigment that is found in the skin and is responsible for skin color. melanin is made by certain types of cells in the body called melanocytes. in people with vitiligo, the skin loses these melanocytes, resulting in the patchy loss of skin color. what are ritlecitinib and brepocitinib? ritlecitinib and brepocitinib are investigational treatments that are being studied for active, non-segmental vitiligo. an investigational treatment is one that is still being studied and is not approved for use outside of research studies. ritlecitinib and brepocitinib may block the activity of certain cells and molecules that are responsible for the loss of melanocytes in the skin. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and effects of ritlecitinib and brepocitinib in people with active, non-segmental vitiligo. researchers wanted to know: during part 1, did participants have an improvement in facial vitiligo after taking study treatment for 24 weeks? "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale The janus kinase (JAK)family, including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine-protein kinase2(TYK2), is a group of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via interactions with Type1 and Type2 cytokinereceptors which are critical for leukocyte activation, proliferation, survival and function.35,36 Upon binding of the cytokine to its receptor, the associated JAKs are activated, and phosphorylate each other and the receptor. The phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for the signal transducer and activator of the transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. The STATs are phosphorylated and subsequently translocate to the nucleus where they bindto specific gene promoters to activate transcription of a range of target genes.35,36 PF-06651600 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits, by irreversibly blocking the ATP binding site, JAK3 and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC)kinase family (brutons tyrosine kinase [BTK], bone marrow-expressed kinase [BMX], inducible T-cell kinase [ITK], TEC, resting lymphocyte kinase [RLK/TXK]), with high selectivity over the other three JAK isoforms, JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, as well as over the broader kinome. PF-06651600 is currently being investigated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, and Crohns disease and will be investigated in vitiligo. Considering the pathogenesis of vitiligo and mechanisms of action for PF-06651600, the hypothesis is to determine if PF-06651600 will have a clinically meaningful effect on treating active non-segmental vitiligo. PF-06700841 is a dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor with a good selectivityprofile over theother human kinases including JAK2. TYK2/JAK1 play critical roles in interferon gamma (IFN) signalingthat regulate the signal transduction pathways triggered by several cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo.21 Study Objectives and Endpoints Study Objectives and Endpoints during Dose Ranging Period Primary Objectives: Primary Endpoints:  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06651600  Percent change from baseline incentral read dose/dosing regimens at Week24 in adult facial-vitiligo area scoring index (facial-VASI) at subjects with active non-segmental Week24. vitiligo.

" atopic dermatitis (ad), also called atopic eczema, is a common skin condition that causes very itchy, red, flaky patches of skin. ad occurs in 10% of adults in the united states. there are currently few approved treatment options in the usa to treat ad, such as dupilumab. these treatments can cause other health problems, or can only be used for short periods of time. researchers are searching for new treatments for ad that can be taken for long periods of time. while researchers think that many things cause ad, it is made worse by the bodys immune system (the bodys defense against infection) causing redness and swelling (inflammation). cells in the immune system cause inflammation by making special proteins called cytokines that send signals around the body. researchers think that medicines that lower the amount of cytokines that the body makes could help treat patients with ad. the drug tested in this study was pf-04965842, which now has the generic name abrocitinib. pf-04965842 is an experimental drug that has not been approved for sale yet. pf-04965842 blocks the activity of a protein called janus kinase 1, which acts like an on/off switch for the cells of the immune system. by turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer cytokines that are believed to make ad worse. in order to measure the safety and efficacy of abrocitinib treatment for ad, it was compared to treatment with placebo or treatment with the drug dupilumab (dupixent). a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine. dupilumab is a medicine that is approved for treating ad. dupilumab blocks the activity of two cytokines, il-4 and il-13 that are believed to make ad worse. the researchers wanted to ask,  are patients who take abrocitinib more likely to have their ad improve compared to patients who are treated with a placebo at 12 weeks?  are patients who take abrocitinib more likely to have their ad improve compared to patients who are treated with dupilumab at 16 weeks? to do this, researchers used 2 tests to measure the severity of each patients ad at the beginning of the study. while the data in this report was collected in the first 16 weeks, the researchers measured the severity of ad during the 20 weeks of study treatment. the difference in severity was used to decide if a patients ad had improved or not. ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by flaky skin lesions, intense pruritus, and a general deterioration in quality of life. Over the past 50 years, AD has become more prevalent, especially in  industrialized, temperate countries such as the United States (US).1,2  AD is one of the most  common, chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, impacting 15-30% of all children in the  US and many have disease that persists into adulthood with a lifetime prevalence of those  affected in childhood reported to be 34%.3  Earlier reports indicated that, in up to 70% of  cases, the disease greatly improves or resolves by late childhood, however more recent  findings suggest that disease activity remains manifest for a prolonged period of time. Based  on a total of 7157 patients enrolled in the Pediatric Eczema Elective Registry (PEER) study,  comprising a total of 22,550 person-years, it was concluded that symptoms associated with  AD seem to persist well into the second decade of life and likely longer.4  At every age, more  than 80% of PEER study subjects had symptoms of AD and/or were using medication to treat  their AD. Of the currently available therapies, none offers a cure; therefore, the main aims of existing  treatments are to reduce the occurrence of acute flares, to increase the time between relapses,  and to reduce pruritus and the resulting sleep disturbance.5,6 Non-medicated topical therapies include emollients. Medicated topical therapy for moderate  to severe AD include topical corticosteroids (TCS) (eg, betamethasone, clobetasol, fluocinonide), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (eg, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus), and coal  tar preparations. TCS are limited in terms of the treatment duration (eg, corticosteroid use is  limited to 2 to 4 weeks) and the body region of treatment, due to consistent skin toxicities, as  well as having risks associated with their broad immunosuppressive actions. TCI have a  limited role as a second-line treatment, due to their limitations in the duration and the body  region of treatment, inhibition of tumor surveillance in the skin, and safety concerns with  malignancies. Crisaborole was approved as a medicated topical therapy in December 2016  by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with mild to moderate AD.  Additional treatments generally reserved for severe AD include phototherapy (eg, ultraviolet  A light [UVA] with or without psoralen, ultraviolet B light [UVB] narrowband or  broadband) and systemic agents (eg, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, recombinant interferon  gamma (IFN-), mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate [MTX], azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin).7 There are a limited number of approved systemic treatments for moderate to severe AD and  in the USA, the only approved systemic drugs are corticosteroids and dupilumab.  Dupilumab, an injectable human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL) -4 and -13, was approved by the FDA in March 2017 and received marketing authorization in Europe in  September 2017, for the treatment of moderate to severe AD. Treatment with systemic  corticosteroids has known and well documented adverse effects. Treatment with dupilumab  has the risk of injection site reactions, allergic reactions, eye and eyelid inflammations and  cold sores. Another potential limitation of dupilumab is the possibility for the development  of antidrug antibodies, which may result in loss of efficacy over time and the development of  safety concerns such as serum sickness-like reactions. Furthermore, dupilumab is delivered  via subcutaneous injection, which may not be a method of administration tolerated well by all patients. During a 1-year, randomized, double-blinded study with dupilumab, in the  dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (marketed maintenance dose) plus TCS group, the  estimated difference from placebo of the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) response  rate and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 response rate were 26% and 46%,  respectively. The placebo response rate for IGA and EASI-75 was 12% and 23%,  respectively. 8  The development of potential treatments with further improvements in efficacy remains desirable. In Europe, cyclosporine is approved for use in patients with  severe AD when systemic therapy is required. Cyclosporine use is associated with several  undesirable side effects and due to its narrow therapeutic index, occasional therapeutic drug  monitoring is recommended. Known adverse effects include infections, renal toxicity,  hepatotoxicity, skin malignancies, lymphoma and other malignancies.  The predominant unmet medical need is for an oral therapy with an acceptable safety profile,  for long-term use, which is effective for moderate to severe AD. Patients with moderate to  severe AD require other systemic treatment options beyond those which are currently approved. PF-04965842 is an oral tablet, providing a more convenient route of  administration compared with the subcutaneous injection required for dupilumab and so it  does not have the potential risk of injection site reactions. Unlike dupilumab, PF-04965842  is a small molecule and there is no anticipated immunogenicity for PF-04965842, and so it is  unlikely to generate antidrug antibodies. Key cytokines implicated in the pathophysiology of AD include IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-31, and IFN-, and require Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) for signal transduction; this suggests that  selective JAK1 inhibitors that modulate the activity of these cytokines represent a  compelling approach to the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.8 PF-04965842 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that selectively inhibits JAK1 by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. PF-04965842 has a high degree of selectivity in vitro against other kinases: 28-fold selectivity over JAK2, >340-fold over JAK3  and 43-fold over tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), as well as a good selectivity profile over the  broader range of human kinases. The selective inhibition of JAK1 will lead to modulation of  multiple cytokine pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AD, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-31 and IFN-. Data from a Phase 2b proof of concept (POC) study (B7451006) that evaluated subjects with moderate to severe AD have shown positive  efficacy, as well as an acceptable safety profile, sufficient to support further clinical  development in a larger Phase 3 program"
" streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections of the lung (pneumonia), brain lining (meningitis), blood (bacteremia), or ear (otitis). these infections may be very serious in young children and older adults. streptococcus pneumoniae is also known as s. pneumoniae. there are 100 types of s. pneumoniae. this study is about a vaccine called the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or 20vpnc. a vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight off germs. 20vpnc may help to prevent infections caused by s. pneumoniae. it is called 20-valent because 20vpnc is intended to prevent 20 of the most common types of s. pneumoniae. 20vpnc is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by s. pneumoniae, although studies are ongoing to assess how well 20vpnc works. after a vaccine is injected into a persons body, the body responds to help fight infections and prevent diseases. the response to vaccines includes making antibodies, which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent diseases. in the united states, 2 vaccines are currently approved for preventing s. pneumoniae diseases. pneumovax 23 vaccine, or ppsv23, is an older vaccine made up of components to prevent diseases caused by 23 types of s. pneumoniae. it has some limitations. the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or 13vpnc, is made up of similar, but more active, components to prevent diseases caused by 13 types of s. pneumoniae. 20vpnc has the same components found in 13vpnc, plus 7 additional active components that may widen protection. it is currently recommended that upon consultation with their health practitioner, adults 65 years and above in the united states receive 1 dose of 13vpnc, followed by 1 dose of ppsv23 1 year later. the purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and about the antibody response to 20vpnc. to learn about the antibody response, researchers asked this question:  one month after receiving 20vpnc, did participants aged 65 or older who had previously received 13vpnc and/or ppsv23 have antibody responses against the 20 types of s. pneumoniae contained in the vaccine? to learn about the safety of 20vpnc in adults aged 65 or older who previously received 13vpnc and/or ppsv23, researchers asked these questions:  what percentage of participants had significant medical problems within 1 month after being vaccinated?  what percentage of participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 10 days after being vaccinated?  what percentage of participants had fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after being vaccinated?  what percentage of participants had newly diagnosed chronic medical problems or serious medical problems within 6 months after being vaccinated? "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale Streptococcus pneumoniaeare gram-positive encapsulated cocci that have been a leading cause of bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) and continue to be a major global public health concern. Serious pneumococcal disease may occur at any age; however, children <5 years and adults 65 years of age are at particularly increased risk. Individuals with certain comorbidities and immunocompromising conditions are also at risk. S pneumoniaeremains an important cause of serious disease in the United States and worldwide. Globally, pneumococcal pneumonia was estimated to cause approximately 1,517,000 deaths in 2015 and, across all ages, accounted for approximately 55% of deaths due to lower respiratory tract infections. The polysaccharide capsule has been identified as an important virulence factor for this pathogen. While more than 95 pneumococcal serotypes differentiated by their capsular polysaccharide composition have been identified, only a subset of serotypes are more commonly associated with severe disease. Pneumococcal disease can be prevented with polysaccharide-based vaccines that induce antibody responses with functional (opsonophagocytic) activity and target the capsular serotypes responsible for disease. Pneumococcal vaccines that contain free polysaccharides, such as the licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) formulated with capsular polysaccharides for 23 pneumococcal serotypes, elicit a T-cellindependent immune response. These vaccines are poorly immunogenic for many of the serotypes contained in the vaccine in children less than 2 years of age, immunocompromised populations, and older adults. They do not induce memory responses in any population, and have limited or no protection against nonbacteremic disease, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which contain capsular polysaccharides covalently linked to a protein carrier, elicit a T-celldependent immune response inducing protective responses in young children, older adults, and populations with high-risk conditions, as well as memory responses and protection against nonbacteremic disease. Prevnar/Prevenar (7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [7vPnC]), which was licensed in the United States in 2000, and Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [13vPnC]), which was licensed in the United States in 2010, are pneumococcal conjugate vaccines containing 7 and 13 capsular polysaccharides, respectively. Hereafter these will be referred to as Prevnar or Prevnar 13 (or 13vPnC). The pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides in those vaccines are individually conjugated to cross-reactive material 197 (CRM ), a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin. These vaccines 197 target serotypes that caused the majority of pneumococcal disease in infants and older adults at the time of their introduction. They have demonstrated efficacy/effectiveness against vaccine-type (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), AOM, and pneumonia and the ability to reduce nasopharyngeal carriage and transmission, resulting in indirect beneficial effects. Pfizer is developing a new 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC) candidate to further expand protection against the global burden of vaccine-preventable pneumococcal disease in children and adults over that of Prevnar 13. 20vPnC has the same composition as Prevnar 13, but contains an additional 7 pneumococcal conjugates to protect against serotypes responsible for a substantial burden of remaining pneumococcal disease. 20vPnC uses the same platform as Prevnar and Prevnar 13 and contains components that have undergone extensive clinical research. Safety and immunogenicity data from a 20vPnC Phase 1 study conducted in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age and from a Phase 2 study in adults 60 to 64 years of age demonstrate the vaccine induces immune responses to the 20 vaccine serotypes and has a safety profile consistent with other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. These data support clinical development in adult and pediatric populations. See the 20vPnC investigators brochure for additional details. CCI The purpose of the study is to describe the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC administered to adults 65 years of age who have been previously vaccinated with various pneumococcal vaccines to provide data in this population. Study Design This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label study will be conducted at investigator sites in the United States and at least 1 European country. A total of ~875 adults 65 years of age will be enrolled into 3different cohorts based on their prior pneumococcal vaccination history. Subjects who have received PPSV23 1 to 5 years previously, but have not been vaccinated with 13vPnC, will be assigned to Cohort A and will be randomized (2:1) to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC. Subjects who have received 13vPnC 6 months previously, but have not been vaccinated with PPSV23, will be assigned to Cohort B and will be randomized (2:1) to receive either 20vPnC or PPSV23. Subjects who have previously received 13vPnC followed by PPSV23 (PPSV23 vaccination must have been given 1 year prior to vaccination in this study) will be assigned to Cohort C and will receive 20vPnC. On Day 1 (Visit 1), subjects will be assessed for eligibility, have blood drawn for immunogenicity assessments in the 20vPnC group and for vaccine research in all subjects, and receive the study vaccination. Subjects will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination and adverse events (AEs) occurring during that time (immediate AEs) will be recorded. Subjects will also receive safety follow-up and electronic diary (e-diary) instructions at the visit. Prompted systemic events (fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain,"
" non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) is the most common type of lung cancer. in some patients with nsclc, the patients liver may not work properly. doctors often describe this as hepatic impairment. hepatic is a latin word for things that are related to the liver and impairment means something that is not working properly. the liver is a large organ in the body that has many different jobs including cleaning the blood and making different proteins and chemicals, as well as acting as a store for other chemicals and energy. if the liver is not working properly, it can mean a patient is not able to take certain types of drugs. this is because the drug could build up in the body and cause medical problems or that not enough drug is able to get into the blood to treat the patients disease. dacomitinib (vizimpro) is a medicine that has been approved in the united states, japan and the european union as treatment for patients with a certain type of advanced nsclc that is known as epithelial growth factor receptor positive (egfr+). advanced nsclc means the lung cancer has spread to other parts of the body. egfr+ means the tumor has a mutation (or change) in the gene that makes egfr proteins. these are proteins on the surface of cells that can stimulate cancer cells to grow and multiply. dacomitinib works by blocking the activity of a group of proteins called the human epidermal growth factor receptor (her) family that including egfr (also known as her1, her2, and her4) in patients who are egfr+. by blocking the activity of these proteins dacomitinib may be able to help limit the growth and spread of cancer cells. dacomitinib is given as a tablet once a day to be taken by mouth. the researchers wanted to know what could happen to dacomitinib in the blood of participants with severe hepatic impairment (e.g., a liver that is hardly working). they also wanted to know if severe hepatic impairment altered how quickly dacomitinib got into the blood and if the amount of drug in the blood changed. to answer this question, the researchers collected blood samples over several days from participants with severe hepatic impairment and from participants with no hepatic impairment (e.g., livers that were working properly). the researchers then measured the amount of dacomitinib in the samples to see if it was different in participants with severe hepatic impairment compared to participants with properly working livers. as food can change how long it takes a drug to reach the blood, this study looked at what happened to dacomitinib in the blood of participants who had not eaten for at least 10 hours. by doing this, the researchers knew that the food the participant had eaten previously was unlikely to change how much dacomitinib got into the blood and how quickly this happened. ","2. INTRODUCTION Dacomitinib (PF-00299804) is a selective, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive,  irreversible, small-molecule inhibitor of the HER (ERBB) family of receptor tyrosine kinases  (RTKs), including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, HER1), the HER2 receptor  (ERBB2), the HER4 receptor (ERBB4), and their oncogenic variants (eg, EGFR with del  exon 19 or L858R mutations). It is currently approved for the first-line treatment of patients  with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with  EGFR-activating mutations. 2.1. Study Rationale The primary metabolic pathways for dacomitinib in human liver microsomes and human  hepatocytes in vitro are comprised of oxidation and glutathione conjugation. In vitro studies  with human liver microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) (rCYP) enzymes  indicated that the formation of PF-05199265 (O-desmethyl dacomitinib) was mediated  primarily by CYP2D6, while CYP3A was involved in the formation of other minor oxidative  metabolites observed in humans following oral administration of a single dose of  [ 14C]dacomitinib. In the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study in humans  (Study A7471020), following oral administration of a single [14C]dacomitinib dose (45 mg,  100 Ci) to 6 male healthy participants, approximately 79% of the administered radioactive  dose was recovered in feces (approximately 20% unchanged dacomitinib) and 3% in urine (<1% unchanged dacomitinib). Dacomitinib is orally bioavailable with mean absolute  bioavailability of 80%. These data indicated significant hepatic component in the  elimination of dacomitinib and minimal renal excretion of dacomintib. A dedicated hepatic impairment clinical study of dacomitinib (Study A7471018) in  participants with mild or moderate hepatic impairment has been completed. Study A7471018 was a multi-center, Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, single-dose,  parallel group study conducted to evaluate the impact of mild hepatic impairment  (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) on the  pharmacokinetics (PK) of dacomitinib. In that study, a total of 25 men who had normal  hepatic function (n = 8), mild hepatic impairment (n = 8), or moderate hepatic impairment  (n = 9) but were otherwise healthy were enrolled and received a single 30 mg dose of  dacomitinib following an overnight fasting for at least 8 hours. Results demonstrated that  plasma dacomitinib area under the concentration time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) were similar in participants with mild  hepatic impairment and were reduced marginally (by 15% and 20% for AUCinf and Cmax,  respectively) for participants with moderate hepatic impairment relative to participants with  normal hepatic function.  The effect of hepatic impairment on dacomitinib was further evaluated using the National  Cancer Institute (NCI) hepatic impairment classification in a pooled population PK analysis  of 1381 participants, which included 158 participants with mild hepatic impairment (total  bilirubin  upper limit of normal [ULN] and aspartate transaminase [AST] > ULN, or total  bilirubin >1 to 1.5  ULN with any AST), 5 participants with moderate hepatic impairment  (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3  ULN and any AST) and 1 participant with severe hepatic  impairment (total bilirubin > 3  ULN and any AST). Limited data (n=1) were available for  severe hepatic impairment. Participants with mild hepatic impairment had similar  dacomitinib clearance (CL) compared to participants with normal hepatic function.  Dacomitinib CL was higher in participants with moderate hepatic impairment with mean CL of 31.4 L/h (n=5) compared to 20.5 L/h (n=1202) in participants with normal hepatic  function. Hepatic function was not a significant covariate on dacomitinib CL.  Based on the results from both the formal hepatic impairment Study A7471018 and the  pooled population PK analysis, mild or moderate hepatic impairment is considered to not have a clinically relevant effect on dacomitinib PK. Therefore, no dose adjustment of  dacomitinib is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  Insufficient data are however available regarding the use of dacomitinib in patients with  severe hepatic impairment to provide dosing recommendations in this patient population. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of severe hepatic impairment on the single  dose PK of dacominitinib. 2.2. Background  2.2.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology Dacomitinib is a highly selective irreversible small molecule inhibitor of the HER (human  epidermal growth factor receptor) family of tyrosine kinases. The IC50 values against the  human catalytic domains of HER-1, HER-2, and HER-4 (HER-3 does not possess tyrosine  kinase activity) are 2.8 ng/mL (6.0 nM), 21.5 ng/mL (45.7 nM) and 34.7 ng/mL (74 nM),  respectively. Dacomitinib is >500  selective relative to the concentrations required to  inhibit the janus kinase 3 (JAK3), protein kinase b (Akt), insulin-like growth factor  1 receptor (IGF1R), and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) in kinase  assays. The IC50 values are 1676, >18,800, >18,800, and 6298 ng/mL (3566, >40,000,  >40,000, and 13,400 nM), respectively. Dacomitinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of  the HER family through binding at the ATP binding site, which results in covalent  modification of a cysteine in the ATP binding pocket. Dacomitinib exhibited anti-tumor effects in 4 different human xenograft models that express and/or overexpress HER family  members. In these xenograft models, the therapeutic activity ranged from complete  regression to delayed progression. The inhibitory effects on tumor growth generally lasted  throughout compound administration. An active metabolite, PF-05199265, has been  identified which has similar inhibitory and selectivity profiles compared to dacomitinib.  "
" what is moderate to severe plaque psoriasis? moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by red, scaly, raised patches (plaques) that may itch or burn. moderate to severe plaque psoriasis can greatly affect the quality of life for patients. in clinical trials, psoriasis is measured using a tool called psoriasis area and severity index (pasi). pasi measures plaque psoriasis using the following items:  amount of the body (body surface area [bsa]) that has patches (plaques)  redness of patches  thickness of patches  level (degree) of scaling (extra flaky skin) what is pf-06826647? the study medication, pf-06826647, is a medication that researchers think may help with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. pf-06826647 blocks a small protein (called tyrosine kinase 2; tyk2) that may cause inflammation and skin patches. when there are too many tyk2 proteins, inflammation and skin patches develop, as seen in psoriasis. what was the purpose of this study?  the primary purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of multiple dose levels of pf-06826647 versus placebo. efficacy means how well a drug improves a disease or condition. this study measured the proportion (how many out of the total) of participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who had a reduction in their patches by 90% (90 out of 100) from the beginning of the study to week 16. this measurement is called pasi90 (that means 90% or more pasi score reduction) for this study.  this study compared the effects of the study drug, pf-06826647, or a placebo to find out which improves moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  other purposes of this study were to provide additional safety and pharmacokinetic (pk) data. pk data means what amount of pf-06826647 was in the blood at various times.  previous studies of pf-06826647 showed adequate safety and improvement of plaque psoriasis to support progression into additional clinical trials requiring longer term therapy. this study explored whether an oral tablet containing pf-06826647 improves the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe psoriasis.  a placebo was used as the comparator to the study drug. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine.

" atopic dermatitis (or ad), which is also sometimes called atopic eczema, is a common skin condition that causes patches of dry, red, and very itchy skin. ad occurs in up to 36% of children and up to almost 23% of adults worldwide. some of the current medicines available for ad can only be used for short time periods, or can cause other health problems. researchers are looking for new treatments for ad that can be applied to the skin that can also be used for long periods of time. brepocitinib (also called pf-06700841) is an experimental medicine that has not been approved for sale yet. brepocitinib blocks 2 enzymes (special proteins that cause chemical reactions in the body) called tyrosine kinase 2 (tyk2) and janus kinase 1 (jak1). tyk2 and jak1 act like a switch for the cells of the immune system (the bodys defense against infection and inflammation). by turning off this switch, the cells of the immune system are expected to produce fewer chemical signals believed to cause ad. brepocitinib was given in the form of a cream that is applied to areas of skin affected by ad. the main purpose of this study was to explore the effect of multiple doses of brepocitinib on ad. the study also tested whether applying brepocitinib cream once-a-day or twice-a-day had a better effect in treating ad. the researchers asked,  are patients who are treated with brepocitinib cream more likely to have their ad improve compared to patients treated with a vehicle cream? in this study, the vehicle cream was skin cream that looked just like the skin cream containing the study medicine (brepocitinib), but did not have any medicine in it. to answer this question, the researchers used a tool called the easi (eczema area and severity index). the easi measures how severe a patients ad is based on 4 different signs, as well as the total amount of a patients skin affected by ad. the researchers also monitored the patients for any medical problems they had while in the study.

" what is psoriatic arthritis? psoriatic arthritis (psa) is a type of arthritis that affects some people with the skin condition psoriasis. psoriasis causes skin cells to multiply faster than normal which makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales. psa typically causes affected joints to become swollen, stiff, and painful. psa is thought to happen as a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue and causing lasting inflammation. like psoriasis, psa is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse. what is pf-06700841? pf-06700841 is a medicine that has shown potential in previous studies for the treatment of psoriasis. pf-06700841 stops the functioning of enzymes known as janus kinase 1 (jak1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (tyk2). these enzymes control signals to the immune system cells that produce proteins known as cytokines which cause inflammation. this inflammation is used by the immune system to fight infections that may be caused by viruses or bacteria. in people with psa, the bodys immune system begins to attack healthy cells and tissue by causing inflammation. by stopping the function of jak1 and tyk2, pf-06700841 may prevent the abnormal immune system response and inflammation in patients with psa. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of pf-06700841 in participants with active (currently experiencing symptoms) psa after 16 weeks of treatment in comparison with a placebo. after 16 weeks, the purpose of this study was to provide all participants with pf-06700841 to determine the safety and beneficial effect of this medicine after using it for 1 year.  pf-06700841 is a new investigational medicine. a new investigational medicine is one that is currently not approved in a country.  a placebo looks like the study medicine but does not contain any medicine. researchers use a placebo to see if the study medicine works better or is safer than not taking anything. researchers wanted to know: did the participants taking pf-06700841 have better effectiveness in the treatment of psa when compared to placebo?  researchers wanted to determine the american college of rheumatology 20 (acr20) score of participants taking pf-06700841 and compare it to the acr20 score of participants taking placebo after 16 weeks of treatment.  the acr20 score was used to assess and establish the improvement by 20% in tender swollen joints of participants along with a 20% improvement in at least three of the following five factors: o inflammation in joints. o participants treatment response and progress. o doctors observations of participants treatment response and progress. o daily pain in joints. o how much psa interferes with the participants daily activities. whether pf-06700841 caused any medical problems in participants?  researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of pf-06700841.  they monitored the participants for any medical problems that happened while they were in the study. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with heterogeneous manifestations affecting the skin, enthesis, synovium, and characterized by peripheral arthritis, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, psoriasis, and nail disease. PF-06700841 is a potent dual inhibitor of human tyrosine kinase (TYK)2 and Janus kinase (JAK)1 with a good selectivityprofile over the other human kinases including JAK2 and JAK3 (PF-06700841 inhibited the in vitro activities of TYK2, JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC ) of 22.7, 16.8 nM, 76.6 nM and 6490 nM, respectively). 50 PF-06700841 is capable of inhibiting many cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA with signaling pathways mediated by JAK1 and/or TYK2. Given the recent United States (US)and European Union (EU) approvals of tofacitinib (a JAK1/3 inhibitor) for PsA, subjects who will receive PF-06700841 in this study are expected to experience improvement in their disease. Compared to other JAK inhibitors, PF-06700841 will inhibit a similar mix of cytokines, but with relatively deeper inhibition of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, due to TYK2 inhibitory activity. PF-06700841 has demonstrated efficacy in a 4-week Phase1 psoriasis trial and a 12-week Phase2 psoriasis study completed recently. PF-06700841 appears to be generally safe and well tolerated in clinical studies todate. This is a 52 week Phase 2b study designed to evaluate the efficacy at 16weeks and to evaluate the safety and efficacy up to 1 year in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis. Objectives: 1. To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06700841 compared to placebo in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and in subjects with active PsA who are Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitor nave. 2. To evaluate the improvement in signs and symptoms related PsA Core Domain Set in PF-06700841 treated subjects. 3. To evaluate theimprovement in patient reported outcome measures and composite outcome measures in PF-06700841 treated subjects. 4. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06700841. Study Design: This is a Phase2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel treatment group, efficacy and safety study designed to characterize the dose response of PF-06700841 in subjects with active PsA. A total of approximately 196subjects will be randomized in a 4:4:1:1:2:2ratio to one of the six parallel treatment sequences as shown below. For the comparison of eachofthree active treatment regimens (60 mg once daily [QD], 30mg QD and 10 mg QD) versus placebo in the primary endpoint of American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 at Week16, this results in a 2:2:1:2 allocation ratio (in the order of 60mg QD, 30 mg QD, 10mg QD and placebo). The study consists of a screening period of up to 5 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 52weeks (ie,one year), including a placebo controlled phase from Day1 to Week16 visits and an extended active treatment phase from Week17through Week52, and a safety follow-up period of 4weeks from last dose of study drug to last study visit. The total duration of study subject participation will be approximately up to 61weeks, from the screening period through the follow-up period. All eligible subjects must have active PsA despite previous or current treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and/or non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs(DMARDs), or apremilast. Some subjects (up to 30% of study population) may also have been previously treated with no more than one TNF inhibitor (TNFi). Randomization will be stratified by prior TNFi exposure. All subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the six treatment sequences (A-F) shown in the table below. Starting after the Week16 visit, subjects receiving the 60 mg QD dose (sequenceA) or the 30mg QD dose (sequenceB) will continue on their initial dose; while all other subjects,including those from the 10mg QD dose arm (sequences C and D) or the placebo arm (sequences E and F), will be randomly assigned to receive either the 60mgQD dose or 30 mg QD dose until Week 52 as predetermined at randomization. All subjects will receive blinded dosing throughout the 52 weeks study treatment period in order to maintain the study blind.

" what is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with type 2 diabetes mellitus? non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is a condition where too much fat is stored in the liver and where those affected drink little to no alcohol. nafld may worsen into a condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash). nash develops when excess fat contributes to increased inflammation and liver cell death. nash is associated with increased risk of death, scarring and failure of the liver, and liver cancers. conditions that increase the risk of nafld and nash to develop include being overweight, type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm), high blood pressure, and high levels of cholesterol and fats in the blood. participants with t2dm are of special interest and included in this study. what is pf-06835919? pf-06835919 was the drug investigated in this study in participants who have t2dm and may have nafld. pf-06835919 reduces the activity of an enzyme called ketohexokinase (khk). khk speeds up the change of fruit sugar (fructose) to energy used by the body and increases fat production in the liver. fructose increases the risk of too much fat in the liver. pf-06835919 was used as a treatment to lower the activity of khk, reduce liver fat, reduce hba1c, and prevent the development of nash. pf-06835919 is an investigational drug because it is not approved for use in this country. what were the purposes of this study? the primary purposes of the study were to compare the effects of pf-06835919 at 2 doses (150 mg and 300 mg) compared with a placebo to find out if pf-06835919 helps reduce liver fat and hemoglobin a1c (hba1c). the amount of hba1c in the blood shows the average amount of glucose (a type of sugar) over the past 3 months. this study looked at the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 doses of pf-06835919 over a 16-week period. specifically, researchers wanted to know if pf-06835919 reduced liver fat and hba1c at 16 weeks compared to placebo (efficacy). safety means that any medical problems that happened were studied. tolerability means whether a medical problem interfered with a participants usual activities. researchers wanted to know: did pf-06835919 reduce the fat in the liver and hba1c in the blood compared to a placebo? ","2. INTRODUCTION PF-06835919 is a ketohexokinase (KHK) inhibitor that is currently being investigated in  participants with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  (NASH). KHK is an enzyme catalyzing the conversion of fructose and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)  to fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), the first committed step in  fructose metabolism. In humans, Loss-of-function in KHK manifests as Essential  Fructosuria, a rare, asymptomatic genetic condition1 that is only recognized by the  appearance of fructose in the urine after fructose consumption.2,3 PF-06835919 is a potent,  reversible inhibitor of human KHK. In nonclinical experiments, treatment with  PF-06835919 reduces the incidence of fructose-induced hepatic steatosis and genetic deletion  of KHK protects mice from fructose-induced hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and  hepatic steatosis (see investigators brochure [IB] Section 5). Based on initial experience in  short duration clinical trials, inhibition of KHK appears generally safe and well tolerated. In  addition, PF-06835919 treatment has shown the potential to reduce liver fat and biomarkers  of inflammation (see Section 2.2.2). It is anticipated that inhibition of KHK will decrease  hepatic de novo lipogenesis and steatosis, thereby ameliorating the pathogenesis of NAFLD and its progression to NASH. 2.1. Study Rationale  The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of PF-06835919 over a  16-week treatment period, as well as the effect of PF-06835919 treatment on liver fat,  hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and additional pharmacodynamic (PD)/ parameters in  participants with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 2.2. Background  Fructose metabolism, unlike glucose metabolism, is not subject to regulatory feedback  inhibition in normal human biology. As a consequence of unrestrained metabolism, fructose  rapidly generates a number of reactive and signaling metabolites that contribute to metabolic  disease progression. Along with the lack of feedback inhibition, hepatic fructose metabolism  has been shown to reduce liver ATP concentrations after a single intravenous (IV) bolus of  fructose.4 Depletion of ATP leads to the activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)  deaminase5 and subsequent increases in uric acid levels that have been shown to directly  regulate hepatic lipogenesis through generation of mitochondrial oxidative stress.6 Additionally, preclinical studies have demonstrated that fructose rapidly enriches glycolytic  metabolite pools, leading to activation of the Carbohydrate Response Element Binding  Protein (ChREBP), a highly lipogenic transcription factor, that can promote both steatosis  and insulin resistance with carbohydrate over-feeding.7 Post-prandial hypertriglyceridemia is  observed in both rodents and humans following fructose feeding, as fructose both decreases  very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) clearance and promotes de novo lipogenesis. Excessive fructose consumption has been shown to cause features of metabolic syndrome  and NAFLD.8 In humans, supplementation of a normal diet with 25% of the calories as  fructose, but not as glucose, caused hyperlipidemia within 2 weeks.9 Additionally, these  participants developed insulin resistance as evidenced by increased insulin excursion during  an oral glucose tolerance test.9 Increased sugar intake, in the form of carbonated beverages,  has been associated with NAFLD in patients who lack other features of metabolic syndrome,  suggesting that fructose intake independent of metabolic disease can increase liver fat.10,11 In a separate study with participants consuming weight-neutral diets containing 25% of dietary calories as fructose, increased hepatic lipid and decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity were  observed after 9 days of high-fructose consumption.12 Conversely, restricting dietary sugar  intake from 28% to 10% for 9 days improved insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatic lipid in  obese adolescents.13 In a separate study, fructose at 5%, 8.75%, or 12.5% of the daily caloric  intake showed a dose-responsive slight elevation in plasma triglycerides (TG) and elevation  in uric acid.14 In studies with matched calories provided as free glucose, fructose was unique  in its ability to promote insulin resistance, visceral obesity and hyperlipidemia.9 Collectively, these data suggest that the fructose, not glucose, component of dietary sugar is  unique in its ability to promote features of metabolic syndrome, including steatosis, insulin  resistance, and obesity.  NASH is a clinical and histological subset of NAFLD that is associated with increased all-cause mortality, cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, increased cardiovascular mortality,  and increased incidence of both liver-related, and non-liver-related cancers. 15 Prevalence of  NAFLD is estimated at 30-40% of the US population, while prevalence of NASH is  estimated at 3-5% of the United States (US) population.15 Risk factors for NASH include  obesity, insulin resistance, T2DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, as manifested by low  levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated TGs.  There are no therapies currently approved for the treatment of NASH, although a growing  body of evidence demonstrates the urgent need for such therapies.15 NASH is diagnosed  clinically by liver biopsy demonstrating steatosis, inflammation, and cytological ballooning  of hepatocytes, often with varying degrees of fibrosis. The clinical progression of NASH  involves increasing degrees of fibrosis, with cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma  developing in a subset of patients.15 Patients with NASH may be asymptomatic or have  non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, despite having significant disease shown by liver  biopsy. More severe NASH is associated with elevated risk for progression to cirrhosis and  liver-related mortality. 2.2.1. Nonclinical Overview In exploratory and/or pivotal toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs, testes and ovary  (rat), and the cardiovascular (rat, dog) and neuromuscular (dog) systems were identified as  primary targets. Adverse findings identified in the pivotal toxicity studies in rats were  degeneration of spermatids in seminiferous tubules of testes at 100 mg/kg/day (no-observed-adverse-effect level [NOAEL] = 30 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study, 2.8x the  predicted human unbound area under the curve over 24 hours (AUC24) at the highest planned  clinical dose of 300 mg once daily [QD]), and an increased incidence (relative to controls) of  decreased/absent corpora lutea in the ovary at 30 mg/kg/day (NOAEL = 10 mg/kg/day in  "
" what is type 2 diabetes mellitus? type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is a disease where the body does not make insulin or does not respond properly to the insulin in the blood. over time, t2dm can cause higher than normal levels of sugar in the blood (hyperglycemia) which can harm the health of people with t2dm. people with t2dm are more likely to develop problems with their kidneys, heart, eyes, and nerves. what is danuglipron? danuglipron (dah-noog-lih-pron, pf-06882961) is an experimental medicine that is taken by mouth and is not yet approved for use by health authorities. danuglipron stimulates the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and may help lower blood sugar levels by increasing insulin secretion. it also increases the feeling of fullness and lowers food intake. what was the purpose of this study? researchers wanted to see if danuglipron helps lower the glycosylated hemoglobin, or hba1c, levels of participants with t2dm whose blood glucose is not under control with metformin treatment (a medicine approved to treat t2dm) and/or diet and exercise. hba1c is a blood test that measures the level of control of a persons blood sugar. this report describes what happened during the study, what the results of the study are, and how participants can learn more about the study. researchers wanted to know: did taking danuglipron help lower the participants hba1c levels when compared to taking a placebo?

" what is moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis? ulcerative colitis, or uc, is an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon (large intestine). people with uc can have symptoms like abdominal pain, rectal bleeding (blood in stool), and loose stools. the immune system is a network of white blood cells, tissues, and organs that help the body to fight infections. uc is a type of autoimmune disease. in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks its own tissues for unknown reasons, creating abnormal inflammation (redness and swelling). a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes play a crucial role in this immune reaction. for this study, uc disease activity was determined based on frequency of stools, rectal bleeding, and endoscopy results (an imaging test of the colon and rectum). participants in this study had uc that was determined to be moderately to severely active. what is etrasimod? etrasimod is an investigational drug that is being studied for uc. it is believed that etrasimod works by reducing the number of lymphocytes in the blood and therefore reducing the abnormal inflammation in the gut in people with moderately to severely active uc. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety and the effects of etrasimod on clinical remission in participants with moderately to severely active uc, compared to placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medication. clinical remission means that the participant has a normal or almost normal frequency of stools, no rectal bleeding, and normal findings on endoscopy (no disease activity). researchers wanted to know: how many participants achieved clinical remission after taking etrasimod or placebo for 12 weeks? what medical problems did participants have during the study? ","SYNOPSIS Sponsor: Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Name of investigational study drug: Etrasimod (APD334) Protocol number: APD334-302 Protocol title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, 12-Week Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Etrasimod in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis Phase: 3 Regions: North America, South America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa Objectives: Primary: The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of etrasimod when administered for 12 weeks on clinical remission in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Secondary: The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of etrasimod when administered for 12 weeks on clinical response, symptomatic response and remission, endoscopic changes, and mucosal healing in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Safety: The safety objective is to assess the safety of etrasimod after daily doses of 2 mg for 12 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Other: Other objectives include evaluation of etrasimod pharmacokinetics (PK) and the effect of etrasimod on health-related subject-reported outcomes and biomarkers. Study design: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod 2 mg in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. The study consists of a 28-Day Screening Period, a 12-Week Induction Treatment Period, and a 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up Period. The target subject population will include (approximately 50% of subjects in each of the following categories): 1. Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to conventional therapy and are nave to biologic or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy 2. Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to a biologic or JAK inhibitor (subjects in this category may have received prior conventional therapy). Subject eligibility will be determined during a 4-Week (28-Day) Screening Period. Entry criteria will be based on confirmation of moderately to severely active UC, defined by a modified Mayo score (MMS) of 4 to 9, which includes an endoscopic score (ES)  2 and rectal bleeding (RB) score  1. Eligible subjects will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either etrasimod (2 mg once daily) or matching placebo (once daily) in a double-blind fashion for 12 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by (a) nave to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy at study entry (yes or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and (c) baseline disease activity (MMS: 4 to 6 or 7 to 9). At the end of the 12-Week Induction Treatment Period, subjects will undergo the Week 12 study assessments. Subjects will then have the option to enter an open-label extension (OLE) study (APD334-303) following completion of Week 12 study procedures provided they meet all eligibility criteria for the OLE. Subjects must complete Week 12 to be eligible for the OLE. Subjects who do not participate in the OLE study will have 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up visits after the last treatment administration. Number of subjects (planned): Approximately 330 subjects are planned to be enrolled into this study. Eligibility criteria: Inclusion criteria: Subjects must meet ALL of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study: 1.

Synopsis This is a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study in which up to 650 healthy pregnant women 18through 49 years of age will be randomized to receive one of 2 dose levels of bivalent (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] A and B) respiratory syncytial virus stabilized prefusion F subunit vaccine (RSV vaccine) at 120 g (60 g A and 60 g B) and 240 g (120 g A and 120 g B) of the prefusion RSVF antigen, formulated with or without aluminum hydroxide (Al[OH] ), or placebo (1:1:1:1:1 randomization). Assessments will 3 include descriptions of safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in maternal participants as well as safety and characteristics of transplacentallytransferred antibodies in their infants. CCI This study will use stopping rules. An internal review committee (IRC) and an external data monitoring committee (E-DMC) will monitor safety in this study. Approximate Duration of Participant Participation Pregnant women will participate in the study from enrollment during their pregnancy, and for approximately 12 months after delivery of their newborn infants. Pregnant women will be vaccinated at a time of year such that the infant is likelyto be exposed to RSV during the first 6 months of life. Infants will participate from birth to approximately 12 months of age. Approximate Number of Participants Up to 650healthy pregnant women will be randomized. Enrollment will be monitored to help ensure distribution of vaccination across the gestational age range of 240/7and 36 0/7 weeks. Respiratory Syncytial Virus Stabilized Prefusion F Subunit Vaccine  The active ingredients in the RSV vaccine are2 stabilized prefusion RSV Fantigens, in equal amounts from virus subgroups A and B, in a lyophilized dosage form for reconstitution. The vaccine is supplied as a lyophilized cake that is reconstituted by diluent with either sterile water for injection or a sterile suspension of Al(OH) in water 3 for injection. Placebo  The placebo for RSV vaccine will be a sterile normal saline solution for injection (0.9% sodium chloride injection, in a 0.5-mL dose). Data Monitoring Committee This study will usean IRC and an E-DMC. Statistical Methods There is no statistical hypothesis specified in this study. The primary objectives are to describe the safety and tolerability of 2 dose levels of RSV vaccine candidate withor without Al(OH) in maternal participants and to assess the safety of maternal immunization in infant 3 participants born to women 18 through 49 years of age who were vaccinated with 1 dose of RSV vaccine during pregnancy. The safety populations will be used to evaluate the primary objectives. Safety data will be analyzed separately for maternal participants and infant participants. Maternal participants will be analyzed according to the investigational product received, and infant participants will be analyzed according to the investigational product their mothers (maternal participants) received. Immunogenicity data for maternal participants and infant participants will be summarized separately with the exception of maternal-to-infant placental transfer analysis. Participants will be summarized according to the vaccine group to which they (for maternal participants) or their mothers (for infant participants) were randomized. All safety and immunogenicity analyses will be descriptive in nature. An analysis will be performed when the delivery-visit RSV-neutralizing antibody titer data from all maternal and infant participants andthe 1-month-after-birth visit data for infant participants are available. A further analysis will be performed when all data are available from the infant participants 6-month visit. Additional analyses may be conducted before the final analysis to support internal program-level decisions as needed. The final analysis will be performed after all participants have completed the study and when all of the data are available. 1.2. Schema Not applicable."
" respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is a virus that can cause an infection with symptoms that are similar to a bad cold, such as cough, fever, sore throat, and runny nose. this infection can be very serious in infants and young children. this study is about a vaccine called the respiratory syncytial virus stabilized prefusion f subunit vaccine , or rsvpref. a vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight off germs. rsvpref may be able to help prevent infections caused by rsv. after a vaccine is injected into a persons body, the body responds to help fight infections and prevent diseases. the response to vaccines includes making antibodies, which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent diseases. this is part of the bodys immune response. the sponsor of this study is developing rsvpref for use in pregnant women. during pregnancy, vaccinated mothers may pass on antibodies to their baby. so, rsvpref may be able to help to prevent infections caused by rsv in infants if it is given to the mother while she is pregnant. rsvpref is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by rsv. the study participants may have received rsvpref, tdap vaccine (a vaccine against diseases called tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), and/or placebo. a placebo looks like the study vaccine but not does contain any active ingredients. the purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of rsvpref when given alone or together with tdap, and to learn whether giving rsvpref and tdap together changes how well either vaccine works. researchers asked these main questions:  one month after vaccination, did participants who received tdap and rsvpref have a comparable level of tdap antibodies to those who received tdap and placebo?  one month after vaccination, did participants who received tdap and rsvpref have a comparable level of rsv antibodies to those who received rsvpref and placebo? to answer these questions, the researchers measured the amount of antibodies in participants blood 1 month after being vaccinated. to learn about the safety of rsvpref when given together with tdap or placebo, researchers asked these questions:  what percentage of participants had local reactions (redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site) within 7 days after vaccination?  what percentage of participants had systemic events (fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) within 7 days after vaccination?  what percentage of participants had medical problems within 1 month after vaccination?  what percentage of participants had serious medical problems or medical problems that required treatment from a doctor during the study?

The purpose of conducting this trial is to support the application for the interchangeability designation with the FDA, not to re-establish PK equivalence between licensed Humira and PF-06410293. The objectives and design of this study are consistent with recommendations for establishing interchangeability (IC) found in the corresponding guidance.7 A designation of IC for an approved biosimilar drug is granted by the US FDA based on information demonstrating that the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (FDA Guidance, 2019).7 In reference to a biological product, interchangeability means that the biological product may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.7 This study has been designed with input from FDA to deliver sufficient information to support the interchangeability of PF-06410293 with the reference product, Humira.

" what is mri? mri stands for magnetic resonance imaging, and it is a scanning machine that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to look inside the body. to do this, the patient needs to lie very still on a bed that is moved inside the scanner. the scanner looks a bit like a large metal tube and the magnets inside this will slowly move around the patient while the scan takes place. this means mri scanners can make lots of noise and sometimes it can be difficult for children to stay still. if a patient moves during the mri, then the scan may need to be repeated. sometimes special drugs called sedatives are given during the mri that make the patient feel calm and drowsy. this means they are less likely to move during the mri. one drug that can be given is propofol and this is often used as a general anesthesia for operations. the term general anesthesia includes medications that put you in a sleep-like state before surgery or other medical procedures. what is dexmedetomidine? dexmedetomidine or dex is a medicine that is given as an injection to adults and children in hospital. dex is not approved for use in children who need tests like an mri. dex is also known as precedex. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of this study was to see if dex could be used to help children feel calm and drowsy and so remain still during the mri. in this study, the researchers looked to see what would happen with 3 different doses of dex (low, middle, and high dose) and if dex could be given by itself without also needing propofol. researchers wanted to know: did participants taking dex have less need for propofol during the mri to help them remain still?

DEX is currently approved  for sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated adults during treatment in an  intensive care setting and for procedural sedation of adults. The present study is being conducted by Pfizer, Inc under the Pediatric Research Equity Act  (PREA) and is a Phase 3/4 randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging study of the safety and  efficacy of DEX used with propofol (PRO) for procedural sedation of pediatric subjects  1 month to <17 years of age undergoing MRI scans. Objectives  The primary efficacy objective is to assess the efficacy of DEX for pediatric  procedural sedation as measured by the percent of subjects at the high dose level  versus the low dose level in the combined age cohorts who do not require  concomitant PRO to achieve adequate sedation.  The key secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of DEX for pediatric procedural  sedation as measured by the percent of subjects at the high dose level versus the low  dose level in each age cohort who do not require concomitant PRO to achieve  adequate sedation.  Other secondary efficacy objectives include:  Explore the efficacy of DEX at the middle dose level compared to the high dose  level and the low dose level in both the overall sample and in each age cohort as  measured by the percent of subjects who do not require concomitant PRO to  achieve adequate sedation.  Explore the efficacy of DEX by examining the percent of time at the target  sedation score, time to first PRO use, emergence time from sedation, proportion  of subjects at each dose level receiving PRO and amount of PRO required  The safety objective is to assess the safety of DEX used for procedural sedation of  pediatric subjects undergoing an MRI scan"
" what is atopic dermatitis? atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that can cause many symptoms, such as itching, redness, and a rash that is scaling or oozing. the symptoms can look different on different people. atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema. people with atopic dermatitis often have this condition for many years, and may have flare ups, when their symptoms worsen for a time. what is crisaborole? crisaborole is a medicine that is used to treat atopic dermatitis. it is applied to the skin as an ointment twice a day. crisaborole may improve symptoms of atopic dermatitis by decreasing inflammation in the skin. inflammation is the bodys immune system response, which can lead to symptoms such as redness. what was the purpose of this study? the purpose of the study was to see if the symptoms of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis were reduced when crisaborole ointment was applied twice a day to the affected area compared to when a vehicle ointment was used. the vehicle ointment does not have any medicine in it, but it looks and feels just like the crisaborole ointment. crisaborole is a licensed treatment for atopic dermatitis in adults and children in some countries (united states, canada, china, israel, and australia). this study was conducted in china and japan to allow data to be collected in these countries. researchers wanted to know: did the symptoms of atopic dermatitis in adults and children 2 years and older reduce in areas of skin treated with crisaborole, and did the condition get better compared to areas of skin treated with vehicle ointment? ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY  Background and Rationale: Crisaborole, also referred as PF-06930164 and AN2728, is a low molecular weight  benzoxaborole antiinflammatory phosphodiesterase4 (PDE4) inhibitor that penetrates into the  skin to the sites of inflammation. The primary mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of  crisaborole is through inhibition of PDE-4. Crisaborole has demonstrated in vitro inhibition  of a range of cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). Crisaborole  inhibits the release of chemokines that are also important inflammatory mediators.  Crisaborole applied to human skin ex vivo or on AD lesions on a subject reduces expression  of key drivers of atopic inflammation including T-cell derived cytokines IL-13, IL-31, and  interferon gamma (IFN) as well as innate markers of inflammation such as matrix  metalloproteinase (MMP)12. Supporting evidence of the safety and efficacy of this product in patients 2 years and older  represent a major advancement in the treatment of AD given the challenges of managing this  common, chronic dermatologic condition and the treatment limiting effects of currently available therapies. All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant in the two Phase 3 registration studies. Across the development program,  crisaborole demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, with no crisaborole treatment related  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and with the majority of Adverse Events (AEs) being mild  and deemed unlikely or not related to investigational product.  In this China and Japan study, a similar study design to the two global pivotal studies  (AN2728-AD-301 and AN2728-AD-302) will be used to investigate the efficacy and safety of crisaborole ointment, 2% twice daily (BID) in Chinese and Japanese pediatric and adult  subjects (ages 2 years and older) with mild to moderate AD, to support the registration of crisaborole in China and Japan. Objectives and Endpoints: Primary Objectives Primary Endpoint(s)  To evaluate the efficacy of  crisaborole ointment, 2% applied  BID versus Vehicle in Chinese and  Japanese pediatric and adult subjects  (ages 2 years and older) with mild to  moderate AD.  To evaluate the safety and  tolerability of crisaborole ointment,  2% applied BID versus Vehicle in  Chinese and Japanese pediatric and  adult subjects (ages 2 years and  older) with mild to moderate AD.  Efficacy endpoint: Percent Change from Baseline (BL) in  Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) total score at  Day 29.  Safety endpoint: TEAEs (including application site reactions) & SAEs, and clinically significant changes in  vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters Secondary Objectives Secondary Endpoints  To evaluate the effect of crisaborole  ointment, 2% applied BID versus  Vehicle on additional efficacy  endpoints over time in Chinese and  Japanese pediatric and adults subjects  (Ages 2 years and older) with mild to  moderate AD.   To evaluate the effect of crisaborole  ointment, 2% applied BID versus  Vehicle on patient/observer reported  outcomes over time in Chinese and  Japanese pediatric and adults subjects  (Ages 2 years and older) with mild to moderate AD.  Efficacy endpoints  Key secondary efficacy endpoints:  Achievement of Improvement in Investigators  Static Global Assessment (ISGA) (defined as  ISGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1)) at  Day 29.  Achievement of Success in ISGA (defined as an  ISGA score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with  at least a 2 grade improvement from Baseline) at  Day 29  Change from Baseline in Peak Pruritus Numeric  Rating Scale (NRS) at Week 4 - for subjects  12 years.  Other secondary efficacy endpoints:  Success in ISGA over time.  Improvement in ISGA over time.  Percent Change from BL in EASI total score over  time.

" what are streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza? streptococcus pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections of the lung (pneumonia), brain lining (meningitis), blood (bacteremia), or ear (otitis). these infections may be very serious in older adults. streptococcus pneumoniae is also known as s. pneumoniae or pneumococcus. influenza (or the flu) is a respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. the flu may cause symptoms like fever, body aches, or sore throat. the flu can be serious in older adults. what are 20vpnc and siiv? a vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight off germs. after a vaccine is injected into a persons body, the body responds to help fight infections and prevent diseases. the response to vaccines includes making antibodies, which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent disease. the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or 20vpnc, may help to prevent infections caused by s. pneumoniae. it is called 20-valent because 20vpnc may help to prevent 20 of the most common types of s. pneumoniae. 20vpnc is an investigational vaccine and it was not approved for general use at the time of this study. the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (siiv) is commonly known as a flu shot. the siiv used in the study is currently approved in the united states for helping to prevent influenza (the flu) in adults 65 years of age and over. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and the effects of 20vpnc and siiv in participants 65 years and older, when given together or separately. researchers wanted to know: did participants who received 20vpnc and siiv together have antibody responses against s. pneumoniae that were considered to be not lower (noninferior) to those who received 20vpnc separately? did participants who received 20vpnc and siiv together have antibody responses against influenza that were considered to be not lower (noninferior) to those who received siiv separately? how many participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 10 days after vaccination with 20vpnc? how many participants had fever, headache, tiredness, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after vaccination with 20vpnc? how many participants had medical problems within 1 month after each vaccination? how many participants had serious medical problems within 6 months after the last vaccination? how many participants had newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions within 6 months after the last vaccination? "," 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1. Synopsis Pfizer is developing a new 20vPnC candidate to expand protection against pneumococcal disease beyond that covered by current pneumococcal vaccines in children and adults. 20vPnC has the same composition as 13vPnC (Prevnar 13) but contains an additional 7pneumococcal conjugates to protect against serotypes responsible for a substantial burden of remaining pneumococcal disease. 20vPnC uses the same platform and contains the same excipients as 13vPnC. 20vPnC is in late-stage clinical development, and data from Phase 3 studies in adults 18 years of age and above provide evidence that the safety profile is acceptable and similar to 13vPnC, and induces immune responses that are expected to support licensure for an adult (18 years of age) indication. Annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended in a number of countries around the world to prevent influenza in adults, particularly adults with risk factors for increased influenza morbidity and mortality, such as those 65 years of age. Currently,13vPnC is also recommended for vaccination of adults in that same age group, based on shared decision-making between an individual and their healthcare practitioner. Therefore, upon introduction of 20vPnC for immunization of adults, it is possible that it may be administered with influenza vaccine during influenza season. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC and SIIV when given together at the same visit compared to the vaccines given 1 month apart (SIIVfollowed 1 month later by 20vPnC) in adults 65 years of age. Adults in this age group may be nave to pneumococcal vaccine or have received prior pneumococcal vaccines, such as PPSV23, 13vPnC, or both; this study will endeavorto enroll participants with these vaccine histories.

" what is covid-19? a new respiratory disease appeared in wuhan, china in december 2019 and has since rapidly spread to many other countries around the world. in january 2020, the cause of this disease was found to be a new coronavirus; and the disease it causes was named covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). people can get covid-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. covid-19 is mainly a disease of the respiratory system, but it can also affect other organs in the body. covid-19 can cause a wide range of symptoms, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of taste or smell. covid-19 symptoms can sometimes be severe. what are bnt162b2 rna-based covid-19 vaccines? a vaccine is used to help the body to fight off germs. after a vaccine is injected into a persons body, the body responds by making antibodies, which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent disease. this is known as the bodys immune response. the bnt162b2 investigational vaccine does not contain the whole virus, or the parts of the virus that can cause covid-19. instead, bnt162b2 is made up of part of the viruss genetic code, surrounded by fatty particles called lipids. it uses the bodys own cells to produce a spike protein. this spike protein may help the body to produce antibodies to fight against covid-19. at the time this study began, bnt162b2 was an investigational vaccine and it was not approved for general use. bnt162b2 has now been approved for use in japan and other countries. an initial course of bnt162b2 is given as 2 doses, about 3 weeks apart. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety and about the bodys immune response to the bnt162b2 vaccine, in healthy japanese adults. researchers wanted to know: did participants have an immune response against the virus that can cause covid-19? how many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site within 7 days after vaccination? how many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after vaccination? how many participants had any medical problems within 1 month after their second vaccination? how many participants had serious medical problems within 12 months after their second vaccination? how many participants from a clinical laboratory subset had abnormal blood test results 1 and 7 days after their first vaccination and 7 days after their second vaccination? what happened during the study? how was the study done? researchers studied 2 groups of study participants. each participant was planned to receive either 2 doses of the bnt162b2 vaccine or 2 doses of placebo, given about 3 weeks apart. a placebo does not have any vaccine in it, but it looks similar to the study vaccine.  group 1 (119 participants): bnt162b2 vaccine  group 2 (41 participants): placebo this was as an observer blinded study, which means that the researchers and the participants did not know if they received the vaccine or placebo, but the healthcare workers who prepared and administered the study vaccines did know. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. participants were first screened by a doctor to make sure they met the requirements to join the study. this was known as the screening period. participants were in the study for about 12 months, and were expected to attend at least 7 visits at the study center during this time. at these visits, participants received study vaccines, had their blood drawn and other lab samples collected, and were monitored for any medical problems. the study was changed after it started to allow participants who originally received the placebo to receive the bnt162b2 vaccine. these participants were then checked for safety for 6 months after their second dose of the vaccine. the first 24 participants who joined the study (12 participants aged 20 to 64 and 12 participants aged 65 to 85) were also enrolled in the clinical laboratory subset. these participants had additional blood tests done. figure 1 below shows what happened during the study. figure 1. "," 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1. Synopsis Short Title:A Phase 1/2 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of an RNA Vaccine Candidate Against COVID-19 in Healthy Japanese Adults Rationale A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China, was first reported in December 2019. On 08 January 2020, the pathogen causing this outbreak was identified as a novel coronavirus. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. On 12 February 2020, the virus was officially named as SARS-CoV-2, and the WHO officially named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19. On 11 March 2020, the WHO upgraded the status of the COVID-19 outbreak from epidemic to pandemic, which is now spreading globally at high speed. There are currently no licensed vaccines to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. Given the rapid transmission of COVID-19 and incidence of disease globally, including Japan, the rapid development of an effective vaccine is of utmost importance. BioNTech has developed RNA-based vaccine candidates using a platform approach that enables the rapid development of vaccines against emerging viral diseases, including SARS-CoV-2. Each vaccine candidate is based on a platform of nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA, BNT162b). Each vaccine candidate expresses 1 of 2 antigens: the SARS-CoV-2 full-length, P2 mutant, prefusion spike glycoprotein (P2 S) (version 9) (BNT162b2 [variant RBP020.2]: a modRNA encoding P2 S) or a trimerized SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) (version 5) (BNT162b1 [variant RBP020.3]: a modRNA encoding the RBD). A Phase 1/2/3 study (C4591001) conducted in the United States in adults 18 to 85 years of age is intended to investigate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these prophylactic BNT162 vaccines against COVID-19. The 2 vaccine candidates (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) at several dose levels were studied in the C4591001 study, and the vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/3 evaluation in the C4591001 study is BNT162b2 at a dose of 30g. This study is a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate selected based on the data from the C4591001 study, in Japanese adults 20 to 85years of age.

" what is covid-19? a new respiratory disease appeared in wuhan, china in december 2019 and has since rapidly spread to many other countries around the world. in january 2020, the cause of this disease was found to be a new coronavirus; and the disease it causes was named covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). people can get covid-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. covid-19 is mainly a disease of the respiratory system, but it can also affect other organs in the body. covid-19 can cause a wide range of symptoms, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of taste or smell. covid-19 symptoms can sometimes be severe. what are bnt162b2 rna-based covid-19 vaccines? a vaccine is used to help the body to fight off germs. after a vaccine is injected into a persons body, the body responds by making antibodies, which are proteins that fight infections and help to prevent disease. this is known as the bodys immune response. the bnt162b2 investigational vaccine does not contain the whole virus, or the parts of the virus that can cause covid-19. instead, bnt162b2 is made up of part of the viruss genetic code, surrounded by fatty particles called lipids. it uses the bodys own cells to produce a spike protein. this spike protein may help the body to produce antibodies to fight against covid-19. at the time of this study, bnt162b2 was an investigational vaccine and it was not approved for general use. bnt162b2 has now been approved for use in many countries worldwide. bnt162b2 is given as 2 doses, about 3 weeks apart. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of and about the bodys immune response to 4 different batches, or lots, of the bnt162b2 vaccine, given as 2 doses and at 2 different dose levels. three of the lots of were intended for use in the united states (us lot), and 1 lot was intended for use in the european union (eu lot). all 4 lots contained the same components and were made in the same way. the researchers needed to compare the investigational vaccines from the different lots and doses to be sure that they worked the same way and were safe to use. researchers wanted to know: did participants who received vaccines from the 3 us lots have similar immune responses? did participants who received a low-dose vaccine have similar immune responses to participants who received a standard-dose vaccine from the same lot? did participants who received vaccines from the eu lot have similar immune responses to participants who received vaccines from the us lots? how many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site within 7 days after vaccination? how many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after vaccination? how many participants had any medical problems within 1 month after their second vaccination? how many participants had serious medical problems within 1 month after their second vaccination? the researchers also studied a booster (dose 3) dose, given about 3 months after dose 2. the main purpose of this part of the study was to learn about the safety and about the bodys immune response to the booster dose. researchers wanted to know: did participants have an immune response to the booster dose? how many participants had pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site within 7 days after the booster dose? how many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, or joint pain within 7 days after the booster dose? how many participants had any medical problems within 1 month after the booster dose? how many participants had serious medical problems within 1 month after the booster dose? "," 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1. Synopsis Short Title: A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Multiple Production Lots and Dose Levels of BNT162b2 RNA-Based COVID-19Vaccines Against COVID-19 in Healthy Participants Rationale A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China, was first reported in December2019. InJanuary2020, the pathogen causing this outbreak was identified as a novel coronavirus 2019. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30January2020. On 12 February 2020, the virus was officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the WHO officially named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On 11 March 2020, the WHO upgraded the status of the COVID-19 outbreak from epidemic to pandemic, which is now spreading globally at high speed. Based on Phase 2/3 safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data, BNT162b2 was shown to be effective and has been authorized for temporary or emergency use in multiple countries. BNT162b2 is administered intramuscularly as a 2-dose series spaced 21 days apart at a dose of 30 g each. Study C4591001 (NCT04368728) is an ongoingPhase1/2/3 trial designed to generate safety, tolerability,immunogenicity, and efficacydata from a novel RNA-based vaccine candidate. The trial is being conducted in a heterogeneous study population: eligible participants 12 years of age, healthy participants, including those participants with stable chronic medical conditions, as well as HIV-, HCV-,and HBV-positive participants. BNT162b2was selected from the Phase 1 part of this studybased on the overall safety, tolerability,and immunogenicity. Tosupport distribution ofthis vaccine on a wider scale,the studywill evaluate theimmune response across 4 different BNT162b2 lots manufactured at a commercial scale: 3lots of drug substance manufactured in the United States and1lot of drug substancemanufactured in Europe(Arms 1-4) and describe the safety and tolerability of these different vaccine lots in healthy participants. Whilethe 30-g dose was selected based on favorable reactogenicity and immunogenicity in both younger and older participants, Phase 1 immunogenicity and safety data were also robust with the 20-g dose in the younger population. Investigating the noninferiority of a 20-g dose compared with the standard 30-g dose may support the potential use of a lower vaccine dose in the defined population of this study. This will be of value with the demand to vaccinate the general population. Therefore, a noninferiority analysis will be performed in this study of a 20-g dose against the standard 30-g dose. The 20-g dose arm (Arm 5) will contain the same US-manufactured drug substance as one of the US lots in the study and will be compared against that same lot in the noninferiority analysis. Note: In this protocol, the US-manufactured drug substance lots are also referred to as the US lots and the EU-manufactured drug substance lot is also referred to as the EU lot. In light of the unknowns regarding duration of protection, as well as the emerging variants of concern (VOCs), it is important to understand the boostability of BNT162b2, and potential heterologous protection against emerging VOC(s). To this end, a booster study extension has been added in protocol amendment 2 in which a small subset of adult participants who received Doses 1 and 2 at 30 g from a designated US lot(s) will receive a single dose of either 30 g BNT162b2 or 30g BNT162b2.B.1.351 (BNT162b2s01 vaccine encoding for thefull-length spike protein of South Africavariant B.1.351[formerly known as BNT162b2 ]). This third dose will be administered at approximately 3 months after Dose 2 SA ofBNT162b2."
" what is covid-19? covid-19 is known as coronavirus disease 2019, which is caused by a virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). people can catch covid-19 from an infected person who has the virus, even if the person has no symptoms. covid-19 can cause a wide range of symptoms, such as fever, chills, cough, loss of taste or smell, and trouble breathing. most people with covid-19 have mild to moderate symptoms. but in some people, covid-19 can be more severe, and they may need hospital care. what is bnt162b2 vaccine? a vaccine can help the body to fight off germs. after a person gets a vaccine, the bodys immune systemmakes antibodies, which are proteins that fight off infectionsand help to prevent a disease. this is called an immune response. bnt162b2 (also called comirnaty) is an injectable vaccine that helps the bodys immune system to defend against covid-19.  it does not contain a whole virus or any part of the virus that can cause covid-19.  it is made up of a part of the viruss genetic code called rna (or ribonucleic acids). this rna teaches the bodys own cells to make spike proteins. these spike proteins may help the body to produce antibodies to fight against covid-19. what was the purpose of this study? researchers tested 3 different versions (also known as formulations) of bnt162b2: freeze-dried, frozen-liquid, and ready-to-use (rtu) bnt162b2. what is a freeze-dried vaccine? the vaccine was first frozen before the water content was removed. then, the remaining contents of the vaccine went through a drying process. what is a ready-to-use (rtu) vaccine? the rtu vaccine is the same as the freeze-dried vaccine before the water content was removed. researchers think that the freeze-dried or rtu bnt162b2 could make storage easier at normal refrigerator temperatures compared with the frozen-liquid bnt162b2. the study had 2 parts. the main purposes of each part were:  part 1: researchers wanted to find out if freeze-dried bnt162b2 and frozen-liquid bnt162b2 produced similar immune responses against covid-19. they also wanted to learn about the safety of both versions of bnt162b2.  part 2: researchers wanted to learn about the safety of frozen-liquid bnt162b2 and rtu bnt162b2. researchers wanted to know: in part 1: 1. did participants who received the freeze-dried bnt162b2 have similar immune responses against covid-19 compared with those who received the frozen-liquid bnt162b2? in parts 1 and 2: 2. how many participants had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days of receiving each vaccination? 3. how many participants had fever, tiredness, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, or muscle or joint pain within 7 days of receiving each vaccination? 4. how many participants had a medical problem during the study? 5. how many participants had a serious medical problem during the study?

Based on Phase 2/3 safety, immunogenicity, and efficacydata, BNT162b2 was shown to be effective and has been authorized for temporary or emergency usein multiple countries. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (also referred to as BNT162b2) is administered intramuscularly as a 2-dose series spaced 21 days apart at a dose of 30 g each. Study C4591001 (NCT04368728) is an ongoing Phase 1/2/3 trial in ~44,000 participantsdesigned to generate safety, tolerability,immunogenicity, and efficacy data from a novel RNA-based vaccine candidate. The trial is being conducted in a heterogeneous study population: eligible participants 12 years of age, healthy participants, including those participants with stable chronic medical conditions, includingHIV-, HCV-, and HBV-positive participants. The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1: to identify the preferred vaccine candidate (BNT162b1 or BNT162b2) and dose level (10g, 20g,30g, or 100 g[for BNT162b1]); Phase 2/3: an expanded-cohort and efficacypart for the selected vaccine candidate (BNT162b2). BNT162b2was selected from the Phase 1 part of this study based on the overall safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. Vaccine efficacy from Phase 2/3 for the primary endpoint against confirmed COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after the second dose was 95% with 8COVID-19 cases in the active vaccine group compared to 162 COVID-19 cases in the placebo group. Data from approximately 38,000 participants randomized 1:1 with a median of 2months of follow-up after the second dose of vaccine showed a favorable safety profile at a dose of 30 g in participants 16 years of age and older. To optimize storage and distribution of this vaccine on a wide scale,a lyophilizedor alternate formulation that will be stable at standard refrigerator or freezertemperatures is required. Therefore, this study will compare the safetyandtolerabilityof lyophilizedBNT162b2 presented in SDVs to those of frozen-liquid BNT162b2 in MDVs and determinewhetherthe immune response is noninferior. Separately, the study will also describe the safety and immunogenicity of frozen-liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification and RTU BNT162b2 (the immediate manufacturing precursor to the lyophilate). The primary immunogenicity analysis demonstrated that the immune response elicited by the lyophilized formulation did not meet the noninferiority criteria compared to the frozen-liquid formulationof BNT162b2. As a result, for the benefit of participants, all study participants who received 2 doses of the lyophilized formulation will be offered an additional vaccine dose, using the 30-g dose of frozen-liquid formulation of BTN162b2.
