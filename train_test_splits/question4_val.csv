" the researchers recorded any medical problems the participants had during the booster stage of the study. participants could have had medical problems for reasons not related to the study (for example, caused by an underlying disease or by chance). or, medical problems could also have been caused by a study treatment, or by another medicine the participant was taking. sometimes the cause of a medical problem is unknown. by comparing medical problems across many treatment groups in many studies, doctors try to understand what the side effects of an experimental drug might be. 292 out of 301 participants (97%) in the booster stage had at least 1 medical problem. no participants (0%) left the study because of medical problems. the most common medical problems during the booster stage are listed below. ","  safety results: in summary, a booster vaccination of bivalent rlp2086, given approximately 4 years after the primary series, was generally well tolerated with a satisfactory safety profile as assessed by the primary and exploratory safety endpoints. during the booster stage, any local reaction was reported by a similar proportion of subjects across all 5 primary vaccination schedules (84.4% to 93.8% of subjects). pain at the injection site was the most commonly reported local reaction, reported by 84.4% to 93.5% of subjects. a similar proportion of subjects across all 5 primary vaccination schedules reported any systemic event (68.8% to 76.6% of subjects). the most frequently reported systemic events were fatigue (51.9% to 65.6% of subjects) and headache (37.5% to 56.3% of subjects). the majority of events were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature with onset 1 to 3 days after vaccination and lasting 1 to 4 days. during stage 1 were considered unrelated by the investigator to primary vaccination in the primary studies and were predominantly developmental conditions or common ailments otherwise anticipated in this population. three (3) subjects reported aes assessed as related by investigators during the booster vaccination phase (1 nonserious ae of worsening of psoriasis, 2 nonserious aes of dizziness [1 subject], and 1 sae of influenza-like illness). one (1) other sae was reported during the booster vaccination phase (meniscus injury). the proportion of subjects reporting any mae across all primary vaccination schedules ranged from 0.0% to 5.1% of subjects. during the booster follow-up phase (from 1 month after booster vaccination [visit 8] through 6 months after booster vaccination [visit 9]), unrelated saes of pyelonephritis, suicide attempt, and depression were reported. the proportion of subjects reporting any mae ranged from 10.9% to 28.8% of subjects across all primary vaccination schedules and these events were mostly routine conditions expected in this population. the safety profile of bivalent rlp2086, when given as a single booster vaccination up to 4 years after primary vaccination, is similar regardless of the schedule for the primary series, and is consistent with the known safety profile for bivalent rlp2086 given according to the licensed primary series schedules. conclusion(s): when administered according to either a 2- or 3-dose schedule, bivalent rlp2086 affords protective immune responses to a high proportion of adolescents 10 to 18 years of age. during the first 12 months after the primary vaccination series the proportion of subjects with protective hsba titers declines but remains higher than baseline, regardless of the 2- or 3-dose schedule, and remains stable through 48 months after primary vaccination. regardless of the primary series vaccination schedule, booster responses were robust with higher proportions of subjects achieving protective titers 1, 12, and 26 months after the booster vaccination compared to 1, 12, and 24 months after the primary series."

","  safety results: a similar proportion of subjects in the acwy-tt group and menps group reported at least 1 local or general solicited event during the 4-day postbooster vaccination period (40.9% versus 37.5%, respectively). grade 3 solicited general events reported within the acwy-tt group included 1 (0.6%) report of fatigue, 1 (0.6%) report of gastrointestinal event, and 2 (1.3%) reports of headache, all of which were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. no grade 3 events were reported in the menps group. the proportion of subjects reporting at least 1 ae during the 31-day postbooster vaccination period was 9.1% (15 subjects) in the acwy-tt group and 3.6% (2 subjects) in the menps group. most reported unsolicited aes were in the system organ class (soc) of infections and infestations (7 [4.3%] in the acwy-tt group and 2 [3.6%] in the menps group). three (3) aes in the acwy-tt group (1 report each of dizziness, hypoesthesia, and oropharyngeal pain) were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. none of the aes in the menps group were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. no related grade 3 aes were reported during this study. no deaths, saes, new-onset of chronic illnesses, or other significant aes were reported during this study. no saes were reported as having occurred between study menacwy-tt-015 (107386) and enrollment in the current study. most solicited local or general events were mild or moderate in severity and none led to study withdrawal. no subjects were withdrawn from the study for safety-related reasons. conclusions: antibody persistence at years 7 to 10 after primary vaccination was higher among subjects primed with menacwy-tt compared with subjects primed with mencevax acwy, as measured by the percentage of subjects with rsba-mena, rsba-menw-135, and rsba-men-y titers greater than or equal to predefined cutoff values. antibody persistence for menc was similar for both vaccine groups. while a robust menacwy-tt booster vaccination response was observed in both vaccine groups, greater gmts were observed in subjects primed with menacwy-tt compared with subjects primed with mencevax acwy at 1 month after booster vaccination. no new safety concerns or adverse reactions for nimenrix were identified in this long-term persistence study of subjects 11 to 55 years of age who received a primary vaccination of either menacwy-tt or mencevax acwy (study menacwy-tt-015 [107386]) and who subsequently received a booster dose of menacwy-tt 10 years after primary vaccination. overall, the results of the analysis at 7 to 10 years after primary vaccination and up to 6 months after booster vaccination continue to support a favorable benefit-risk assessment of menacwy-tt in this age group."

combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (chemotherapy period) followed by avelumab 800 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) in combination with talazoparib (maintenance period), were analyzed for serum avelumab concentrations. avelumab predose concentration(s)/ concentration(s) at the end of the dosing interval (c ) were relatively low, and accumulation was minimal in the chemotherapy period trough (median range of 4.4 to 10.0 g/ml), which is consistent with q3w dosing of avelumab, given its estimated half-life of 6.1 days. median avelumab c were higher in the trough maintenance period, ranging from 41.6 g/ml on day 29 of cycle 1 to 28.6 g/ml on day 1 of cycle 4, and were consistent with expected c following avelumab 800 mg q2w trough monotherapy. talazoparib pharmacokinetics talazoparib pre-dose concentrations were collected in cycle 1 of the maintenance period in 24 participants: 16 in arm a and 8 in arm b. however, only a limited number of samples met the pre-specified criteria required for inclusion in the summary statistics. pk  coadministration of avelumab 800 mg q3w with platinum-based chemotherapy in the chemotherapy period and q2w with talazoparib in the maintenance period of arm a resulted in avelumab c and c concentrations that were consistent with max trough those expected following avelumab monotherapy at this dose level and dosing frequency."
