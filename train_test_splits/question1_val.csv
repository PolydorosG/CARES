" meningococcal disease is an infection that can cause swelling around the brain and spinal cord. the risk of meningococcal disease is increased in adolescents and young adults. people who get meningococcal disease are at risk for hearing loss and other disabilities. however, meningococcal disease may be prevented with a vaccine. a vaccine is a medication that helps people fight off germs. meningococcal disease is caused by the meningococcus germ. there are different types of this germ. for example, meningococcal type b disease is caused by the meningococcus b germ. since vaccines were available to help fight off other types of meningococcus germ, but not type b, researchers were interested in finding a vaccine that can protect against meningococcal type b disease. rlp2086 is a vaccine for meningococcal type b disease. it is approved for use in adolescents and young adults in europe and the united states. it is given by injection into the arm. the purpose of this study was to learn more about how the rlp2086 vaccine works. researchers wanted to know:  how many participants would have antibodies against meningococcus b at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after receiving their last dose of vaccine?  how many participants would have antibodies against meningococcus b 1 month after receiving their last dose of vaccine, before receiving a booster vaccine, and at 1, 12, and 26 months after receiving the booster vaccine? to answer these questions, researchers collected blood samples from the participants. the researchers looked for antibodies in the blood against 4 different strains of meningococcus b. antibodies are special proteins that can recognize and help kill germs. these antibodies can protect people from getting sick if they ever do come into contact with the meningococcus b germ. researchers were also interested in learning more about the safety of the vaccine. they monitored for any medical problems the participants had after receiving the vaccine. ","protocol summary background and rationale neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, adolescents, and young adults. in particular, n meningitidis serogroup b (mnb) is responsible for approximately two-thirds of the cases of observed meningococcal infections in europe, with a case-fatality rate of 6% to 8% from 1999 to 2006. mnb disease accounts for approximately one-third of meningococcal cases seen in north america. a recombinant, multicomponent mnb vaccine (bexsero) is licensed in the europeanunion (eu), canada, australia, and chile; and recommendations for use are under consideration in various countries. trumenba (bivalent recombinant lipoprotein 2086 vaccine), developed by pfizer, has recently (october 2014) been approved in the united states for active immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by n meningitidis serogroup b, for use in individuals 10 through 25 years of age. the us centers for disease control and preventions advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) has assigned a category b recommendation for administration of mnb vaccines for adolescents and young adults aged 16to 23 years, with particular focus on the 16-to18-year age group. a categorya recommendation was assigned for mnb vaccinationofcertain groups of persons at increased risk for serogroup b meningococcal disease, including for persons aged 10 years during outbreaks of serogroup b meningococcal disease. broad implementation of a safe and immunogenic vaccine against diverse mnb strains is anticipated to provide substantial improvement in prevention of this uncommon but severe bacterial infection and a reduction in the burden of disease. trumenbais targeted to a conserved, surface-exposed lipoprotein, lipoprotein 2086 (lp2086), a meningococcal virulence factor that binds human factor h, and therefore is designated as factor h binding protein (fhbp). the lp2086 gene is present in 100% of mnb strains in pfizers strain collection of more than 1800 strains isolated from patients with invasive disease in the united states and europe. the lipoproteins segregate into 2antigenically and immunologically distinct subfamilies, a and b. trumenba is a sterile suspension composed of 2 recombinant lipidated fhbp variants from mnb, 1 from fhbp subfamily a and 1 from subfamily b (a05 and b01, respectively). this study was initiated in september 2012 to assess the longevity of immune responses in adolescents (aged 10 to <19 years at the time of entry into a primary study) following receipt of a vaccination regimen of 2 or 3 doses of bivalent rlp2086 in a primary study (a previously conducted pfizer study using the final formulation of bivalent rlp2086). this study was amendedin january 2015 to add a booster dose of bivalent rlp2086 at approximately 4 years following the final dose of the 2-or 3-dose primary bivalent rlp2086 vaccination series. the study was therefore divided into stage 1 (4-year persistence of immune responses following receipt of a primary vaccination series) and the booster stage (follow-up through 12 months after booster vaccination). thestudy is now amended to further evaluate safety and immune responses up to 26 months following a single booster dose of bivalent rlp2086. the postbooster follow-up through 26months after booster vaccination is being conducted for a subset of booster stage subjects who previously received bivalent rlp2086 in a primary series of either a 0-, 2-,and 6-month or a 0-and 6-month schedule. the rationale for focusing on this subset of subjects is based on the fact that the 0-,2-, and 6-month and the 0- and 6-month schedules are the dosing schedules approved by the food and drug administration (fda). objectives: primary objectives stage 1  to describe the immunogenicity of bivalent rlp2086 as determined by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hsba) titers to 4 primary test strains at approximately 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after the last dose (second or third dose) of bivalent rlp2086 or saline in the primary study (ie, a previously conducted pfizer study using the final formulation and dose of bivalent rlp2086). booster stage  to describe the immune response as measured by hsba titers to 4 primary test strains 1 month following the last vaccination with bivalent rlp2086 in the primary study, before the booster vaccination,and 1 month,12 months,and 26 months after a single booster dose of bivalent rlp2086. primary safety objective(booster stage)  to evaluate the safety profile of bivalent rlp2086 as measured by the incidence of local reactions, systemic events, adverse events (aes), serious adverse events (saes), newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (ndcmcs), medically attended events, and immediate aes following a booster vaccination of bivalent rlp2086. primary endpoints stage 1  proportion of subjects with hsba titers  lower limit of quantitation (lloq) for each of the 4 primary strains at each blood draw visit in stag"
" cancer, in general, is one of the common causes of death for both men and women. drug pf-05212384 (gedatolisib) was the investigational drug in this study. an investigational drug is one that is not approved for sale in this country at the time of the study. gedatolisib is still under development to control the growth of cancer cells. researchers think that gedatolisib might help to stop or slow down certain types of proteins which cause cancer cells to grow. gedatolisib stops cancer growth pathways. this study was divided into 2 parts, or phases. the main purpose of this trial was to learn about the effects of gedatolisib and to find a correct dose for when it is given in combination with other drugs in adult patients with different types of advanced cancer. all the patients in this study received gedatolisib in addition to one other drug. there were 3 treatment combinations or groups called arms in this study:  (arm a) - docetaxel kills fast dividing cells like cancer cells.  (arm b) - cisplatin stops cancer cells from growing.  (arm c) - dacomitinib inhibits cancer growth pathways. both docetaxel and cisplatin are regarded as standard treatment for these types of cancer. in the first part of the study, several patients left the study early on due to their cancer getting worse or due to other medical problems. as a result, arms a and c had to finish early. this means that only arm b (gedatolisib in combination with cisplatin) was used to estimate the correct dose of gedatolisib for that combination. in the second part of the study, researchers wanted to assess the effect of gedatolisib when taken in combination with cisplatin in patients with a certain type of breast cancer called triple negative breast cancer (tnbc). 2 ","PROTOCOL SUMMARY Rationale: Signaling through the (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) PI3K pathway is associated with  resistance to a variety of anti-tumor agents. This has been described pre-clinically with  cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with varying mechanisms of action including taxanes, and  (deoxyribonucleic acid) DNA-damaging agents. In the clinic, activated PI3K pathway in  tumors has been correlated with decreased response to therapy and worse clinical outcomes. In addition to resistance to cytotoxic agents, there is also evidence of PI3K signaling  affecting sensitivity of cells to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family signaling  inhibitors. Specifically, the activation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse  outcome in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents. In  addition, pre-clinical studies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation  in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and have  demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse resistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor  models. Collectively, these findings suggest that PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors may increase the efficacy of both chemotherapeutic agents which are considered  standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of several solid tumors and dacomitinib which has  shown clinical activity in several tumor types.  Objectives: Original Protocol through Amendment 4 Primary Objective  To assess the safety and tolerability and to estimate the maximum tolerated dose  (MTD) of the following combinations in patients with advanced solid tumors:  Arm A: PF-05212384 and docetaxel.  Arm B: PF-05212384 and cisplatin.  Arm C: PF-05212384 and dacomitinib. Secondary Objectives  To evaluate the overall safety profile.  To assess the effects of PF-05212384 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of docetaxel,  cisplatin and dacomitinib and vice versa in Arms A, B, and C respectively.  To evaluate possible biomarkers of efficacy (eg, KRAS mutation) and  pharmacodynamic (PD) effects in paired tumor biopsies (eg, pAkt levels) and serum  (eg, insulin levels)  To characterize the effects of the combinations on the potential to prolong the QTc interval.  To document anti-tumor activity"
" a seizure is a sudden increase in electrical activity in the brain. epilepsy is when 2 or more seizures occur that are separated by at least a day, and for which there is not cause for the seizure which can be corrected. seizures can take on many different forms, can cause many different symptoms, and vary from person to person. seizure symptoms can include a feeling or warning that a seizure is about to occur, a temporary loss of consciousness, or a feeling of being confused. the initial symptoms may also progress to shaking of the arms and legs. partial onset seizures, also known as focal seizures, are a common type of seizure. this type of seizure begins in only one part of the brain. this study included children with partial onset seizures. there are medicines that are available that can be used to stop or control seizures in children, but these medicines may not work well for all children and they may not be tolerated well. therefore, researchers are interested in finding additional treatment options for children with epilepsy (seizures). pregabalin is a medicine that may be used as an add-on treatment for children with epilepsy, which means that the medicine is given along with other epilepsy medicines that the child is already receiving. pregabalin is currently approved in the united states only for older children (at least 4 years of age) with partial onset seizures. pregabalin is not approved in any country for the add-on treatment of partial onset seizures in children 1 month to younger than 4 years of age. this study was done to learn more about using pregabalin as add-on therapy in these younger children with partial onset seizures. for this study, researchers wanted to answer the following question:  would pregabalin reduce the frequency of partial onset seizures, compared to placebo? ","protocol summary indication: adjunctive therapy for children 1month(44weeks gestational age)through<4 years of age inclusive with partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. background and rationale: epilepsy is a common disorder in childhood affecting 4 to 5 of every 1000 children. although epilepsy is often well controlled with existing antiepileptic drug (aed) therapy, more than 25% of pediatric patients have seizures that are uncontrolled by currently available agents, or have adverse effects related to aeds that complicate management of their seizures. in addition, children with epilepsy often suffer from impaired academic performance, with 55% functioning below their grade level and an additional 16%significantly behind in educational training.1 children with epilepsy also have a higher likelihood of developing behavioral difficulties, which may persist into adulthood.2 early age of onset and a higher number of total lifetime seizures are the strongest correlates of academic underachievement. therefore, the availability of a new aed that has been shown to improve seizure control,and that is well tolerated,is needed. pregabalin is approved in more than 100countries, with indications summarized below for the united states (us), european union (eu), and japan (jp). in the us, pregabalin is indicated for the adjunctivetherapy foradult patients with partial onset seizures. in addition, pregabalin is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury. in the eu, pregabalin is indicated as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. in addition, pregabalin is indicated for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults and for generalized anxiety disorder in adults. in japan, pregabalin is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. the approved dose range for the adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in adults is 150 to 600mg/day, administered twice daily (bid) or 3 times daily(tid). the most common adverse effects reported with pregabalin in placebo controlled adjunctive trialsin adults with partial onset seizures were dizziness (32%) and somnolence (22%). since initial market approval of lyrica in 2004through the first quarter of 2012, it is estimated that more than 15,900,000 patient years of exposure have accumulated worldwide. this study is one of several studies that will be conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of pregabalin in pediatric subjects with epilepsy and to address post approval commitments to us and eu regulatory authorities. objectives: primary efficacy objective  the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of two doselevels of pregabalin compared to placebo as an adjunctive treatment in reducing the frequency of partial onset seizures in pediatric subjects 1month through <4 years of age. secondaryefficacy objective  to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin compared with placebo on the frequency of partial onset seizures as determined by responder rate in pediatric subjects 1 month through <4 years of age.  to assess the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in pediatric subjects 1month through <4 years of age with partial onset seizures. study design: study a0081042 is a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized, parallel group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacyof twodoselevels of pregabalin compared to placeboadministered tid as adjunctive therapy in pediatric subjects 1month(44weeks gestational age)to <4 years of age with partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. randomization will be stratified by subject age (stratum 1: <1 year of age; stratum 2: 1-2 years of age; stratum 3: >2 years of age). subjects in each age stratum within site will be randomized to either placebo or 1 of 2 fixed doses ofpregabalindivided tid, dose level 1: pregabalin 7mg/kg/day [6 mg/kg/day for subjects 1 to 3months of age] or dose level 2: pregabalin 14mg/kg/day [12 mg/kg/day for subjects 1 to 3months of age] in a 2:2:1ratio. every reasonable effort will be made to enroll a minimum of 10subjects in each of the 3age strata. the study is composed of 4phases:  video-electroencephalographic (eeg)baseline phasewith a target minimum of 48hours. to ensure that the target minimum of 48hours of video-eeg is obtained, the total duration of the video-eeg baseline phase will be up to 72 hours.  5day double-blind dose escalation phase.  9day double-blind fixed dose treatment phase, which includes a video-eeg evaluation over the final 3days at the end of this 9-day phase with a target minimum of 48hours and a total recording duration of up to 72 hours. for subjects who successfully complete the target 48hour video-eeg or must terminate the video-eeg recording before the end of this 9-day phase,"
" chemotherapy is often used to treat cancer, but not all patients cancer gets better with treatment. the drugs used for chemotherapy can kill healthy cells in a patients body along with the cancer cells, which can cause serious medical problems. researchers are looking for new ways to treat cancer by directing chemotherapy drugs to cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone. pf-06647020 is a new investigational drug being studied to treat patients with cancer. an investigational drug is one that is currently not approved for sale in this country. pf-06647020 is a type of medicine called an antibody-drug conjugate. an antibody- drug conjugate is made up of an antibody with a toxic agent chemically attached to it. antibodies are special proteins made by the immune system that recognize and stick to specific proteins on the surface of germs or cells. the antibody part of pf-06647020 recognizes a protein called ptk7, which is found in larger amounts on certain cancer cells when compared to healthy tissue. researchers think that pf-06647020 will deliver the toxic agent directly to cancer cells, slowing their growth and causing the cells to die. the main purpose of this phase 1 study was to learn more about the safety of pf 06647020, and to find the best dose of pf-06647020 to use to treat cancer in phase 2 trials. to do this, the researchers asked,  what medical problems did patients have while taking pf-06647020?  what dose-limiting toxicities, or dlts, did patients have when taking pf-06647020? dlts are certain medical problems caused by taking pf-06647020 which require the patient to lower the dose or stop taking the medicine temporarily or permanently. the researchers also wanted to know if any of the patients cancer got better during the study. to do this, they measured many things, including the clinical response rate. this was the percentage of patients whose cancer stayed the same or got better during 6 or more cycles of treatment. ","protocol summary background and rationale: antibody-drug conjugates (adcs) were developed to improve the therapeutic indices of cytotoxic anti-cancer agents. the strategy makes use of an immunoconjugate in which a cytotoxic agent is chemically or enzymatically linked to an antibody that selectively binds to an internalizing tumor-associated antigen. this strategy allows specific delivery of the cytotoxic agent to the tumor site while minimizing the exposure to normal tissues. pf-06647020 is an anti-ptk7 adc intended to be for the treatment of patients with cancer. pf-06647020 is comprised of a humanized anti-ptk7 monoclonal antibody (mab) linked to an auristatin (aur0101) via a cleavable cysteine-reactive linker. auristatins are fully synthetic dolastatin-based pentapeptide inhibitor of tubulin polymerization that induce g2/m cell cycle arrest and cell death at low picomolar intracellular concentrations.13,14 ptk7 is a phylogenetically conserved member of the pseudokinase family of receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) with no observable kinase activity.4 genetic and biochemical studies in multiple organisms have demonstrated a key function for ptk7 in planar cell polarity via the wnt-pathway signaling, and ptk7-deficient embryos have developmental defects.3,7,11 in addition, ptk7 promotes cell survival in colorectal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (aml), and ptk7may promote resistance to chemotherapy in aml.9,12 bioinformatics and literature analysis have revealed that ptk7 mrna expression levels in many types of tumors are higher than corresponding normal tissues including bladder, brain, breast, colorectal, gastric, kidney, liver, lung, pancreatic and skin cancer. in addition, ptk7 was found to be enriched in cancer stem cells (cscs), also known as tumor-initiating cells, harvested from patient-derived xenografted tumor models of triple negative breast cancer (tnbc) and non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) in preclinical studies.19 it was also reported that higherexpression of ptk7 is linked to poor prognosis in patients with nsclc and tnbc who received chemotherapy, particularly in a subgroup patient population who received anthracycline treatment.2,19 in preclinical studies, pf-06647020 induced sustained tumor regressions in models of ovarian cancer (ovca), nsclc and tnbc.19 tnbc accounts for 15% to 20% of breast cancers and is diagnosed based on lack of estrogen receptor (er)and progesterone receptor (pgr)expression by immunohistochemistry (ihc) and lack of her2 over expression or gene amplification by ihc or in situ hybridization, respectively. tnbc is a heterogeneous disease, not only on the molecular level, but also on the pathologic and clinical levels. the majority of patients with tnbc respond with high sensitivity to chemotherapies including anthracyclines and taxanes in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings. however, tnbc is associated with a significantly higher probability of relapse and poor overall survival (os) in the first few years after diagnosis compared with other breast cancer subtypes. positive expression of ptk7in tnbc was observed in ~84%of archived samples surveyed using a research grade ihc assay(pfizer internal data). nsclc accounts for approximately 85% cases of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the united states (us) and worldwide. most patients with nsclc have locally advanced and distant metastatic disease (stage iii/iv) at the time of presentation, which is associated with a poor prognosis with 5-year os rate less than 10%. although targeted therapies (eg,erlotinib and crizotinib) for patients with nsclc whose tumors carry epidermal growth factor receptor(egfr) mutation orare anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk)-positive have provided encouraging clinical outcomeand promising immunotherapies are being developed, the unsatisfactory treatment outcomes in advanced nsclc highlights the need of novel alternative therapies. in addition, ptk7 expression in nsclc was observed to cover a dynamic range (pfizer internal data), suggesting that patient selection by ptk7 expression levels may identify patients that may be more likely to benefit. ovca is the 6th most common malignancy in developed countries with approximately 100,000new cases resulting in nearly 65,000deaths per year.15 patients are typically treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy. initial therapy consists of combinations with platinum-containing agents which results in responses in 70-80% of patients. however, the disease relapses in almost all patients requiring further therapy. the timing of the relapse from the end of the platinum-containing regimen has been shown to be prognostic with platinum-resistant tumors (defined as progression while receiving initial therapy or relapse <6months from end of initial regimen), as having the worst outcomes.16 pegylated doxorubicin and topotecan are both indicated as single agents in patients with refractory ovca. in patients with platinum-resistant disea"
" cloistridioides difficile (previously clostridium difficile) is a germ or bacteria that can be found in the bowel of some people. this germ is also known as c. difficile or c. diff. sometimes when people take antibiotics to treat an illness, the c. difficile that is in their bowel can multiply. this is because antibiotics kill both good and bad bacteria and killing the good bacteria gives the c. difficile room to spread. c. difficile infections are often seen in people who have a weakened immune system because of other illnesses or due to old age. the immune system is what defends the body from germs like c. difficile. when someone has a c. difficile infection they will usually have diarrhea or loose stools. this is because when c. difficile multiples in the bowel, it can produce toxins. a toxin is a substance made by a living cell that is harmful to the body. c. difficile makes 2 different toxins and these are called a and b. these toxins damage the bowel and this is what makes people ill. doctors will prescribe antibiotics to try to get rid of c. difficile. for some people, the antibiotics may not work and a different antibiotic may need to be given. sometimes these antibiotics may not work and the c. difficile cannot be gotten rid of easily and other treatment options are needed. if the infection cannot be treated, the diarrhea can get worse, and the person could become very ill and may die. researchers did this study to see if the c. difficile vaccine could help the bodys immune system produce antibodies against the toxins made by c. difficile. antibodies are special proteins made by the body that can recognize and help kill germs or toxins. antibodies can protect people from getting sick if they come into contact with a germ or toxin that the body recognizes. the researchers conducting this study wanted to see if the c. difficile vaccine was safe and if antibodies could be made against the modified c. difficile toxins in the vaccine. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale Clostridium difficile (C difficile), a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacillus, is a major cause of antibiotic-associated nosocomial diarrhea in the developed world. In the last decade, the numbers and severity of C difficileiatrogenic outbreaks in hospitals and nursing homes have increased. Key factors in this escalation include emergence of hypervirulent pathogenic strains such as BI/NAP1/027, increased use of antibiotics, and increased exposure to spores in healthcare facilities. Two large clostridial toxins, C difficile toxin A (TcdA)and C difficile toxin B (TcdB), are the principal virulence factors of C difficileassociated disease (CDAD)and both cause severe inflammation in the bowel. A causal relationship between toxin-producing clostridia and antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis was first established in 1978. The clinical presentations of CDAD range from asymptomatic colonization to severe diarrhea, and may progress to pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, intestinal perforation, and death. Although most patients experiencing a first episode of CDAD respond well to standard antibiotic treatment, approximately 15% to 25% of the patients suffer from at least 1 recurrence. However, the risk of subsequent episodes is 33% to 65% if the patient has already experienced a first recurrence. Fecal transplantation has been shown to be rather effective in the treatment of multiple recurrences of CDAD. However, regulatory oversight of this method remains in development and, therefore, a highly effective noncumbersome treatment for complicated CDAD does not exist. Adults above the ageof 65 years are at increased risk for CDAD, particularly in the healthcare setting, and the likelihood of severe infection among adults similarly increases with age. It is anticipated that the C difficilevaccine will ultimately be evaluated for efficacy and safety in an older target population, whose ability to mount an immune response may be impaired: This may influence the selection of an optimal vaccination regimento ensure short-and long-term protection. To date, there is no vaccine available to prevent CDAD. Investigational vaccines are in clinical development, but none is licensed. Pfizers vaccine candidate consists of a mixture of genetically modified C difficiletoxoids A and B that are further chemically inactivated to eliminate residual cytotoxicity but retain native antigenic structure. In preclinical experiments, Pfizers vaccine candidate was studied either alone or in combination with an adjuvant. In the hamster disease model, all vaccine formulations demonstrated a survival benefit, providing at least 90% protection from a lethal challenge with C difficilespores in the immunized hamsters. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), all of Pfizers toxoid vaccine formulations tested induced robust neutralizing antitoxin antibody responses to both TcdA and TcdB. Pfizers C difficilevaccine candidatewas assessed in a Phase 1 study (B5091001), conducted in the United States, where 192 healthy adults aged 50 to 85 years were enrolled. This first-in-human(FIH) study was a dose-escalating, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blinded trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of C difficile vaccine, as a 3-dose regimen at Months 0, 1, and 6. Three antigen dose levels (50, 100, and 200g) of the vaccine candidate were assessed either alone or in combination with aluminum hydroxide. The analysis of safety demonstrated that both formulations and all 3 dose levels were generally well tolerated. Local reactions were predominantly mild ormoderate and comprised mostly injection site pain. No actual severe or Grade 4 local reactions were reported. In the 65-to 85-year age cohort, at the 200-g dose level, local reactions tended to occur more frequentlyin the toxoid-alonecompared to the aluminum hydroxidecontaining dose groups after all 3 doses. After all 3 doses, the frequency and severity of local reactions did not increase with increasing dose level or number of doses for any of the dose groups. Systemic events were predominantly mild to moderate and comprised mostly headache and fatigue. There was no evidence of increased frequency of systemic events with increasing dose level or number of doses for any of the dose groups. The analysis of immunogenicity demonstrated a limited antibody response after Dose 1, but after Dose 2 there were marked increases in antibody titers against both toxin A and toxin B, which were generally maximal 7 days after Dose 2 and stable 1 month after Dose 2. Seven days after Dose 3, a substantial booster response was evident, which was slightly more marked again 1month after Dose 3. Overall, robust antitoxin neutralizing responses were elicited by both formulations, although there was a trend for greater responses in recipients of the toxoid-aloneformulation. With respect to the dose level, because of the limited sample size, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were often overlapping for all 3 dose levels, indicating that it was not possible to discern a clear dose response. In light of these results, a Phase 2 Study(B5091003) was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the 100-and 200-g antigen dose levels of the toxoid- aloneformulation in a 3-dose regimen administered at Days 1, 8, and 30 in healthy adults 50to 85 years of age. Vaccinations in this study were stopped following the occurrence of 7cases of Grade 3 injection site erythema among 162 subjects receiving the second vaccination at Day 8.Among therecipients of the active vaccine, this corresponded to an incidence of 5.0% (95% CI 2.1%to10.1%). There were no accompanying severe systemic symptoms in the subjects, there was no report that the redness impacted their daily activities, and all local reactions fully resolved. The local reactogenicity observed with the toxoid-aloneformulation may have been due to free toxoid interacting with the elicited immune response. Since adsorption onto aluminum has been shown to bind and slowly releasethe vaccine constituents from the injection site, and reflecting the potential need for rapid induction of immune response and prolonged duration of protection, Study B5091009 will evaluate the safety,tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 antigen dose levels of the aluminum hydroxidecontainingvaccine (ie,100g and 200 g) in 2different dosing regimens: Days 1, 8, and 30 or Months 0, 1, and 6. The primary immunogenicity endpoint will be assessed based upon a specified threshold estimate for each C difficilevaccine toxoid. The specified thresholds for each toxoid are considered to indicate protective titers."
" squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in the squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the outer layer of the skin and the mouth, nose, and throat. squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer found in the head and neck. researchers are looking for treatments for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. avelumab is a medicine that may work by targeting a protein called programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1) found on the cancer cell. pd-l1 is involved in the bodys immune system response to cancer. when this study was started, avelumab was being tested for use in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. locally advanced refers to cancer that has spread to nearby body tissues. although avelumab is approved in other types of cancer, it is not approved for use in head and neck cancer. the standard treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck includes a combination of radiation therapy and a chemotherapy medicine called cisplatin. the main goal of this study was to determine if adding a new drug (avelumab) before, during, and after standard treatment would increase the amount of time it takes for cancer to worsen (progress). the study also evaluated the overall safety of avelumab in combination with standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment. "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background Head and neck cancers, including cancers of the oral cavity, nasopharynx, pharynx, and larynx, account for approximately 5% of cancers worldwide (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers).9 Approximately 680,000 new cases of head and neck cancer were diagnosed in 2012 with 370,000 deaths attributed to this disease; of these new cases reported, almost 140,000 were in Europe, and over 90% were squamous cell histology.10 In the US, it is estimated that over 61,000people will be diagnosed with head and neck cancer in 2016 and over 13,000 will die from this cancer.62 Head and neck cancers are predominately squamous carcinomas. Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN) involving the oral cavity, larynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx account for 75% SCCHN overall and are closely associated with alcohol and tobacco use. SCCHN of the oropharynx is also closely associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16infection.11 In the past 2 decades, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers have increased dramatically especially in North America, underscoring an important role in HPV infection and oropharyngeal cancer.12 Although the incidence of HPV-negative SCCHN has decreased, consistent with decreasing use of tobacco products worldwide, the curability of HPV-negative tumors remains suboptimal.43 Of newly diagnosed patients with SCCHN, approximately 60% present with locally or regionally advanced disease.10,13 Depending on the tumor site, stage, and resectability, locoregional failure rates can range between 35% and 65%. With a median PFS of 1.9 years and reported 3-year PFS rate of 61.2%, this disease will ultimately recur locally in a large proportion of treated patients, with distant metastases developing in 10% to 30% of these patients.13,44,57 Currently available treatment options for both locoregional and distant recurrences are limited. Outcomes for both groups of recurrences are abysmal, and the limited number of patients who are eligible for potentially curative treatment for locoregional disease recurrence are exposed to a high degree of morbidity. Study Rationale There are emerging data supporting the rationale for combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy.18,19 Chemotherapy has been shown to have immunostimulatory properties by stimulating the release of neoantigens and adjuvants by dying cells, increasing susceptibility to immune attack, and preferentially reducing immunosuppressive cells such as Tregulatory cells.20,21,22,23 Several immune checkpoint inhibitors have been combined with chemotherapy agents. The addition of ipilimumab to dacarbazine led to an improvement in PFS and OS in previously untreated melanoma compared to dacarbazine alone.25 Ipilimumab was combined with platinum doublet chemotherapy in small cell as well as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with encouraging results.26,27 Single-arm studies investigating the combination of programmed death protein 1(PD-1) blockers (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) as well as a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocker (atezolizumab) with platinum doublet awthezicohli zaupmpeaabr.s2 7t,o28 b,2e9, 3h0i,3g1heRra tnhdaonm exizpeedc tPehda fsoer p slatutidniuems nd otuhbe lfeitr stht-elirnaep ytr aelaotmnee,n pta orfti cNuSlaCrLlyC f or 3 i patients are currently investigating the addition of pembrolizumab and atezolizumab to platinum-based chemotherapy. In addition to the data supporting combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy, a strong body of evidence supports the combination of radiation therapywith immunotherapy such as a PD-L1 inhibitor.34,35 Radiation therapy (RT) in combination with avelumab was found to be highly synergistic, capable of causing complete regression of established tumors with the potential to generate antitumor immune memory.17 There are currently several studies ongoing evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitor agents in later lines of treatmentfor SCCHN patients. These trials have demonstrated activity in this tumor type for this class of drugs when used as single agents for patients with recurrent or metastatic disease. Nivolumab, in the CheckMate 141 study in platinum-refractory patients in the recurrent or metastatic setting, has demonstrated an improved OS relative to alternative investigator-choice chemotherapy at 7.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.5 9.1) vs. 5.1 (95% CI: 4.0 6.0) months (HR 0.70 [97.73% CI: 0.51 0.96]), and was stopped early by the data monitoring committee (DMC). Updates presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2016 Annual Meeting described the activity in subgroups of patients with tumors that were p16 positive (N=63 HR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32- 0.99) or negative (N=50, HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.42 -1.25) and those whose tumors were positive for PD-L1 staining at 1% (HR: 055; 95%CI: 0.36-0.83) vs. 1% (HR: 0.89 95% CI: 0.54-1.45).59 Also at ASCO, updatedefficacy data for pembrolizumab in recurrent/metastatic SCCHN (KEYNOTE-012) was presented. An overall objective response rate (ORR) of 18% (34/192; 95% CI: 13-24%) was observed, with ORR of 24% (11/45, 95% CI: 13 -40%) and 16% (23/147, 95% CI: 10 23%)in HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients, respectively. However, the limited number of patients evaluated and overlapping 95% CIs preclude definitive conclusions regarding any role HPV or PD-L1 status may play in response to checkpoint inhibitor treatments. Additionally, it should be noted that both HPV groups had the same (n=4) number of patients with CR in the KEYNOTE-12update. Median time to response was 2 months, but several patients took substantially longer to respond (range: 2-17months). Median OS was 8 months (95% CI: 6 10months) in these heavily pretreated patients with 38% alive at 12months.60,61 These trials provide strong early evidence that SCCHN represents a tumor type that is responsive to this class of agents. Collectively, these data, the strong scientific rationale for radiation (which increases PDL-1 expression) and immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations, and the poor patient options if disease control is not obtained in front-line therapy, persuasively argue for progressing an immune checkpoint inhibiting agent into combination therapy with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) to provide an optimized, multimodality approach to treat this disease and help patients avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with disease progression. This combination can potentially overcome the treatment resistance that patients experience, in particular for HPV-negative tumors.43"
" what is ulcerative colitis? ulcerative colitis (uc) is a long-term inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation (swelling) and ulcers (sores) in the digestive tract. uc affects the mucosa (inner lining) of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. patients with uc experience occasional periods of increased inflammation, known as flares. flares are characterized by diarrhea (loose stools) and presence of blood in the stools, as well as sense of urgency. flares are followed by periods of remission (time with no symptoms) that vary in length from weeks to years. there is no known cure for uc. treatment can greatly reduce signs and symptoms of uc and can even lead to long term remission. however, there are few treatment options for patients with moderately to severely active uc. medication is the most common treatment for uc. what is tofacitinib? tofacitinib (tow-fah-sit-in-ib) (xeljanz) is a medicine that works to reduce the activity of the immune system. it is an oral (taken by mouth) medication that has been approved, and is available by prescription, to treat adults with active, moderate to severe uc that did not respond well to other medications. what was the purpose of this study? researchers have continued to study tofacitinib to find out more about its safety and how well it works. in one study, researchers saw that participants with uc who took either 5 mg or 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day were more likely to stay in remission compared to participants who took placebo. however, a formal study to compare a reduced dose of tofacitinib (5 mg twice a day) to the standard dose (10 mg twice a day) of tofacitinib had not been done. in this study, researchers wanted to find out if participants with uc who were in stable remission (ongoing time with no symptoms) would stay in remission if the dose of the treatment was reduced from 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day to 5 mg of tofacitinib twice a day. researchers also wanted to learn more about the safety of tofacitinib in participants who switched from 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day to 5 mg of tofacitinib twice a day compared to participants who continued to take 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day. researchers wanted to know:  what difference did switching from 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day to 5 mg of tofacitinib twice a day have on the percent of participants in remission after 6 months compared to staying on 10 mg of tofacitinib twice a day?  what medical problems did participants have during the study? "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale The tofacitinib Phase3 ulcerative colitis (UC)program evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinibin patients with moderately to severelyactive UC who had prior failure or intolerance to corticosteroids, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (AZA/6-MP), and/or tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi)agents.

" what is streptococcus pneumoniae? streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacteria that can cause serious diseases, including infections of the lung (pneumonia), brain lining (meningitis), blood (bacteremia), or ear (otitis). these infections may be very serious in young children and older adults. streptococcus pneumoniae is also known as s pneumoniae. there are about 100 types of s pneumoniae. what is the c7vpnc vaccine? this study is about a vaccine called the complementary 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or c7vpnc. a vaccine is used to help prevent infection by helping the body to fight off germs. c7vpnc may help to prevent infections caused by s pneumoniae. it is called 7-valent because it has the potential to prevent 7 common types of s pneumoniae. it is referred to as complementary as it is expected be used with prevnar 13, a vaccine approved in the united states that is made up of components to prevent disease caused by 13 types of s pneumoniae. when used together, c7vpnc and prevnar 13 could have the potential to prevent disease caused by 20 different types of s pneumoniae. c7vpnc is an investigational vaccine, which means that it has not been approved for general use and it is not yet known if it will protect against disease caused by s pneumoniae. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of this study was to learn about the safety of c7vpnc in healthy infants, when given with or separately from prevnar 13. researchers wanted to know:  how many of the infants in the study: o had redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site within 7 days of each vaccination? o had fever, low appetite, sleepiness, or irritability within 7 days after each vaccination? o had medical problems from dose 1 to 1 month after dose 3, and from dose 4 or the supplemental dose to 1 month after? o had serious medical problems or any newly diagnosed chronic medical problems during the study? "," PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale Streptococcus pneumoniaeare gram-positiveencapsulated cocci that are a leading cause of bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM) and continue to be a major global public health concern. Serious pneumococcal disease may occurat any age; however, children<5 years and adults 65 years of age are at particularly increased risk. Individuals with certain comorbidities and immunocompromising conditions are also at risk, especially persons with chronicheart, lung, liver, and renal disease, as well as those who are functionally asplenic. AOM carries the risk of complications such as tympanostomy tube placement, hearing loss, mastoiditis, and meningitis as well as being a significant burden on the healthcare system. S pneumoniaeremains an important cause of serious disease in the United States and worldwide. The polysaccharide capsule has been identified as an important virulence factor for this pathogen. While more than 95pneumococcal serotypes,differentiated by their capsular polysaccharide composition,have been identified, serious diseaseis generally causedby a smaller subset of serotypes. Pneumococcal disease can be prevented with polysaccharide- based vaccines that induce antibody responses with functional (opsonophagocytic) activity andtarget the capsular serotypes responsiblefor disease. Pneumococcal vaccines containing free polysaccharides, such as the licensed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23),are poorlyimmunogenic in immunocompromised populations, older adults, and children less than 2 years of age,and are not recommended inthis younger age group. This led to development of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which contain capsular polysaccharides covalently linked to a protein carrier, and whichinduceprotectiveimmune responses in young children and older adults, as well as populations with high-risk conditions. Prevnar (7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), which was licensed in the United States in 2000,and Prevnar 13(13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), which was licensed in the United States in 2010, are pneumococcal conjugate vaccines containing 7 and 13 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides, respectively, that are each covalently linked to a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin, cross-reactive material (CRM ). These vaccines 197 targetedserotypes that caused the majority of pneumococcal disease in infants and older adults at the time of their introduction. They have demonstrated efficacy/effectiveness against vaccine-type(VT)invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)such as bacteremia and meningitis, as well as AOM, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Additionally, they have been found to reduce nasopharyngeal carriage and transmission, resulting in beneficial indirect effects. Pfizer is developing anew complementary 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (c7vPnC) candidate to expand protection against pneumococcal disease beyond that covered by current pneumococcal vaccinesin childrenand adults. c7vPnC contains pneumococcal conjugates of 7 different serotypes (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F). c7vPnC contains the same conjugate carrier protein and excipients and uses the same platform as Prevnar 13. A meta-analysis of serotypes causing IPD in children <5 years of age in regions of the world that have introduced higher-valent pneumococcal conjugatevaccines (such as Prevnar 13) to thePrevnar 13 vaccine types.CCI The purpose of this Phase 2 studyis to describe the safety and immunogenicity of c7vPnC coadministered with Prevnar 13 in infants at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age or given 1month after Prevnar 13 at 3,5, 7, and 13 months of age. CCI Safetyand immunogenicity data from this study will inform further clinical development of c7vPnC in pediatric populations. Additional information for this compound maybe found in the single reference safety document (SRSD), which for this study is the c7vPnC investigators brochure (IB). The SRSD for Prevnar 13is theUS package insert (USPI). Study Design This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled,open-label study with a 3-arm parallel design. It isplanned tobe conducted at investigatorsites in the United States. A total of565infants aged 42 to 98 days will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive a vaccine series with:  c7vPnC coadministered with Prevnar 13 (Group 1 -coadministration);  c7vPnC given 1 month after Prevnar 13 (Group 2 - staggered administration); or  Prevnar 13 alone as the active control group (Group 3 -control with Supplemental Dose). A single dose of c7vPnC will be administered afterthe Prevnar 13 series is completed in this group. In all groups, Prevnar 13 will be administered at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age. c7vPnC will be administered at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months ofage in Group 1; at 3, 5, 7, and 13 months of age in Group 2; and at 13 months of age in Group 3.

" what is moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis? ulcerative colitis, or uc, is an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon (large intestine). people with uc can have symptoms like abdominal pain, rectal bleeding (blood in stool), and loose stools. the immune system is a network of white blood cells, tissues, and organs that help the body to fight infections. uc is a type of autoimmune disease. in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks its own tissues for unknown reasons, creating abnormal inflammation (redness and swelling). a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes play a crucial role in this immune reaction. for this study, uc disease activity was determined based on frequency of stools, rectal bleeding, and endoscopy results (an imaging test of the colon and rectum). participants in this study had uc that was determined to be moderately to severely active. what is etrasimod? etrasimod is an investigational drug that is being studied for uc. it is believed that etrasimod works by reducing the number of lymphocytes in the blood and therefore reducing the abnormal inflammation in the gut in people with moderately to severely active uc. what was the purpose of this study? the main purpose of this study was to learn more about the safety and the effects of etrasimod on clinical remission in participants with moderately to severely active uc, compared to placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the investigational drug. clinical remission means that the participant has a normal or almost normal frequency of stools, no rectal bleeding, and normal findings on endoscopy (no disease activity). researchers wanted to know: how many participants achieved clinical remission after taking etrasimod or placebo for 12 weeks? how many participants achieved clinical remission after taking etrasimod or placebo for 52 weeks? what medical problems did participants have during the study? ","SYNOPSIS Sponsor: Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Name of investigational study drug: Etrasimod (APD334) Protocol number: APD334-301 Protocol title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, 52-Week Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Etrasimod in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis Phase: 3 Regions: North America, South America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa Objectives: Primary: The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of etrasimod on clinical remission in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) after 12 and 52 weeks of treatment. Secondary: The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of etrasimod on clinical response, symptomatic response and remission, endoscopic changes, corticosteroid-free remission, and mucosal healing in subjects with moderately to severely active UC at timepoints up to 52 weeks of treatment. Safety: The safety objective is to assess the long-term safety of etrasimod after daily doses of 2 mg for up to 52 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Other: Other objectives include evaluation of etrasimod pharmacokinetics (PK) and the effect of etrasimod on health-related subject-reported outcomes and biomarkers. Study design: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod 2 mg in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. The study consists of a 28-Day Screening Period, a 12-Week Treatment Period, a 40-Week Treatment Period, and a 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up Period. The target subject population will include (approximately 50% of subjects in each of the following categories): 1. Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to conventional therapy and are nive to biologic or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy 2. Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to a biologic or JAK inhibitor (subjects in this category may have received prior conventional therapy). Subject eligibility will be determined during a 4-Week (28-Day) Screening Period. Entry criteria will be based on confirmation of moderately to severely active UC, defined by a modified Mayo score (MMS) of 4 to 9, which includes an endoscopic score (ES)  2 and rectal bleeding (RB) score  1. Eligible subjects will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either etrasimod (2 mg once daily) or matching placebo (once daily) in a double-blind fashion for up to 52 weeks (12-Week Treatment Period + 40-Week Treatment Period). Randomization will be stratified by (a) nave to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy at study entry (yes or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and (c) baseline disease activity (MMS: 4 to 6 or 7 to 9). End of 12-Week Double-Blind Treatment Period At the end of the 12-Week Treatment Period, subjects will undergo the Week 12 efficacy and safety assessments and procedures. Subjects whose disease is stable or improving compared with baseline (Week 0/Day 1) will continue with their double-blind treatment and move into the 40-Week Treatment Period. Subjects must complete Week 12 to be eligible for the OLE. Subjects who do not meet disease worsening criteria, including those demonstrating clinical response/remission at Week 12 will continue into the 40-Week Treatment Period and continue their double-blind treatment. Disease worsening will continue to be monitored by Investigators through the 40-Week Treatment Period (ie, from Weeks 13 to 52). Subjects who either experience disease worsening in the 40-Week Treatment Period or complete all study procedures at Week 52 will have the option to enroll into the OLE study if they meet all eligibility criteria. Subjects may be eligible to enroll in the OLE provided their ES is  2 and they meet one of the following entry criteria:  RB subscore  2 at 2 timepoints at least 7 days and no more than 14 days apart  RB + SF subscores  4 at 2 timepoints at least 7 days and no more than 14 days apart  RB subscore  2 or RB + SF subscores  4 (in any order) at 2 timepoints at least 7 days and no more than 14 days apart For subjects discontinuing prior to Week 52, an endoscopic evaluation is required to confirm eligibility for the OLE. An endoscopy should be performed upon the appearance of UC symptoms but no more than 14 days after the second timepoint for symptom criteria above. A proctosigmoidoscopy does not need to be repeated if performed within the last 4 weeks. Subjects who do not participate in the OLE study will have 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up visits after their last treatment administration End of 40-Week Double-Blind Treatment Period (Week 52) At the end of the 40-Week Treatment Period (ie, Week 52) and following completion of all study procedures, subjects will have the option to enter into the OLE study (APD334-303) provided they meet all eligibility criteria.
