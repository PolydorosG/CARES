" how was the study done? participants were checked (screened) to make sure they were a good fit for the study. participants who were a good fit were assigned by chance to receive either:  tofacitinib 5 milligrams (mg) twice per day by mouth,  tofacitinib 10 mg twice per day by mouth (these participants were later switched to tofacitinib 5 mg twice per day, due to new safety information about tofacitinib),  or a tnf inhibitor (participants in the united states, puerto rico, and canada received adalimumab 40 mg every other week by injection under the skin, participants in other countries received etanercept 50 mg once per week by injection under the skin) this was an open-label study, which means that the participants and doctors knew which treatment and dose the participants received. participants were expected to attend visits at the study center for the baseline visit, at month 2, month 3, then every 3 months thereafter, and to complete an end-of-study visit, and an end-of study visit at least 28 days later. the figure below shows what happened during this study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 323 locations in 30 countries in africa, asia, australia, europe, north america, and south america. when did this study take place? it began on 14 march 2014 and ended 22 july 2020. who participated in this study? this study included adult men and women who:  were 50 years of age or older  had moderate to severe ra  had an inadequate response to treatment with methotrexate alone  had at least one additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease  a total of 952 men (22%) participated  a total of 3,410 women (78%) participated  all participants were between the ages of 50 and 88 participants could continue taking study treatment as long as they continued to benefit from it, or until the study ended. of the 4,362 participants who started the study and received treatment, 3,111 completed it. a total of 1,615 participants stopped taking study treatment early  by their choice,  because they did not see significant improvement in ra symptoms,  because they had a medical problem, or  because a doctor decided it was best for them to stop the study how long did the study last? the amount of time that each participant was in this study varied. the entire study took more than 6 years to complete. when the study ended in july 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3b/4 randomized, parallel arm, open-label safety endpoint study. All subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms with approximately 1. Tofacitinib 5 mg BID (oral). 2. Tofacitinib 10 mg BID (oral). * 3. TNFi: In the US, Puerto Rico and Canada, subjects randomized to TNFi will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week (QOW) by subcutaneous injection (SC); in all other countries, subjects randomized to TNFi will receive etanercept 50 mg once weekly by SC injection. * In response to new safety information about tofacitinib that was provided to Study A3921133 investigators on 19 February 2019, investigators were notified to verbally inform subjects randomized to tofacitinib 10 mg BID to reduce the dose of tofacitinib to 5 mg BID within 7 calendar days of this notification, secure their verbal agreement to continue in the study, and if they agreed, reduce their dose of tofacitinib to 5 mg BID for the remainder of the study. Tofacitinib is supplied as 5 mg tablets, which allowed subjects to decrease from their previous dose of 2 tablets twice daily to 1 tablet twice daily. During the study, subjects may require alternate therapies in addition to, or instead of, their randomized drug assignment. All subjects, regardless of their treatment regimen will participate in the study until study completion. (See Sections 5.6.1 and 6.5). Study completion will be declared when all 3 of the following conditions are met: 1. At least 1500 subjects have been followed for at least 3 years. 2. The targeted number of MACE are observed (See Section 9.2.1). 3. The targeted number of malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers are observed (See Section 9.2.1). It is expected that approximately 4000 subjects will participate in the study and the expected duration of the study is approximately 5 years following randomization of the first subject. The exact number of subjects and duration of the study will be determined by the pre- specified rules outlined in the charter of the blinded Steering Committee. (See Section 9.6) The study design schematic for the study is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Study Design (Minimum 1300 Per Arm, Total N=4000) Reduced to 5 mg BID per Amendment 8"
" how was the study done? researchers tested palbociclib (test medicine) combined with letrozole on a group of study participants with advanced breast cancer to find out if it provided a longer pfs than study participants with advanced breast cancer taking placebo plus letrozole. a description of the how the study was done can be seen in figure 1 below. figure 1. a description of how the study was done. after the last dose of palbociclib treatment, study participants were contacted by the study team every 6 months to asked about:  any changes in the health of the participant  any medications the participant was taking study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. neither the study participants nor the researchers knew who took palbociclib and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 52 locations across mainland china, hong kong, taiwan, thailand, and singapore. when did this study take place? it began 23 march 2015, and the primary completion date was 31 august 2020. primary completion date corresponds to the date when the last participant was examined or received treatment and that results for the main results were collected. this study is ongoing. who participated in this study? the study included participants with advanced breast cancer, who were between the ages of 18 and 70 years, had already experienced menopause, and had not received any systemic treatment for their advanced disease.  a total of 340 women participated and 339 women were treated in this study  all participants were between the ages of 29 and 70 years participants were to be treated until disease progression, death or unable to tolerate the treatment, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. pfs was determined based on the disease progression or death of study participants. of the 340 participants who started the study, 138 are still participating in the study. two hundred and ninety participants discontinued the study treatment because  the participant died  the participant was lost to follow-up  the participants cancer got worse  the participant experienced medical problems  the participants left by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study how long did the study last? the entire study took 5 years to the primary completion date, the study is still ongoing. however, when the primary completion point was reached in august 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN This is an international, multicenter, randomized(1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3 clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus placebo in combination with letrozole in postmenopausal Asian women with ER(+)/HER2 (-) advanced breast cancer. Eligible patients will have histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast with evidence of locoregionally recurrent or metastatic disease and will be candidates to receive letrozole as first-line treatment for their advanced disease. In order to avoid inclusion of patients who are refractory or resistant to non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, patients who received anastrozole or letrozole as a component of their (neo)adjuvant regimen may only enter the study if their disease did not progress while on or within 12 months from completion of their anastrozole/letrozole-containing (neo)adjuvant therapy. Patients will not have received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for their advanced disease and will not be candidates for curative therapies. Patients must have measurable disease as per RECIST v.1.1 or bone disease as their only site of disease. At least approximately 330 eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Palbociclib plus letrozole (Arm A: at least approximately 165 patients) or placebo plus letrozole (Arm B: at least approximately 165 patients). Among these approximately 330 patients, at least 264 patients will be from China and the rest of the patients will be from other Asia countries. Patients will be stratified at randomization by region (China vs other), by site of disease (visceral* vs non-visceral**), by disease-free interval since completion of prior (neo)adjuvant therapy (de novo metastatic; 12 months; >12 months), and by the nature of prior (neo)adjuvant anticancer treatment received (prior hormonal therapy; no prior hormonal therapy). *Visceral refers to any lung and/or liver involvement. **Non-visceral refers to absence of lung and/or liver involvement. Patients randomized to Arm A (investigational arm) will receive:  Palbociclib, 125 mg, orally once daily on Day 1 to Day 21 of every 28-day cycle followed by 7 days off treatment; in combination with  Letrozole, 2.5 mg, orally once daily (continuously). Patients randomized to Arm B (comparatorl arm) will receive:  Placebo orally once daily on Day 1 to Day 21 of every 28-day cycle followed by 7 days off treatment; in combination with  Letrozole, 2.5 mg, orally once daily (continuously). Patients will continue to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. However, patients may continue treatment as assigned at randomization beyond the time of RECIST-defined disease progression at the discretion of the investigator if that is considered to be in the best interest of the patient and as long as no new anticancer treatment is initiated. In this case, the patient would continue with routine safety relevant assessments The importance of timely and complete disease assessments in this study cannot be overstated. Disease assessments will be performed every 12 weeks ( 7 days) from the date of randomization. Patients with bone lesions identified at baseline will also have repeat bone scans performed every 24 weeks ( 7 days) from the date of randomization. Each assessment will be performed as scheduled according to the calendar regardless of any dosing delay to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of efficacy. Failure to perform any of the required disease assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status for that time point. Tumor assessments will be performed until radiographically and/or clinically (ie, for photographed or palpable lesions) documented PD as per RECIST v.1.1, study treatment discontinuation (for patients continuing treatment beyond RECIST-defined disease progression), initiation of new anticancer therapy or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation (eg, death, patients request, lost to follow-up), whichever occurs first. A series of incomplete disease assessments will result in censoring of the primary endpoint of PFS back to the time of the last full assessment that did not show progression. Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than radiographically and/or clinically (ie for photographed or palpable lesions) documented PD as per RECIST v.1.1 will continue to have tumor assessments performed during the follow-up visits every 12 weeks ( 7 days) and bone scans (if applicable) every 24 weeks ( 7 days) until RECIST-defined disease progression, initiation of new anticancer therapy or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation (eg, death, patients request, lost to follow-up), whichever occurs first. However, a blinded independent third-party core imaging laboratory will complete a retrospective review of radiographic images and clinical information collected on-study to verify the protocol-defined endpoints of disease response and progression as assessed by the investigator. Patients discontinuing the active treatment phase will enter a follow-up period during which survival and new anti-cancer therapy information will be collected every 6 months from the last dose of investigational product. The follow-up period will conclude at the time of the final OS analysis. Patients will undergo study-related safety and efficacy assessments as outlined in the relevant Schedule of Activities located in the summary section. The study also includes molecular profiling components aimed at characterizing alterations in genes, proteins, and RNAs relevant to the cell cycle, drug targets, and tumor sensitivity and/or resistance in tumor tissues, and assessing the relationship between germline polymorphism in CDK6 gene and palbociclib treatment related neutropenia."
" this study compared 6 groups of participants to find out if people given an injection of 2 different doses of the c. difficile vaccine at different times reacted differently compared to people given placebo (see table). in this study, the c. difficile vaccine was given at a dose of 100 micrograms or 200 micrograms, and the placebo was saline (also known as salt water). a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks similar to the medicine. researchers use a placebo to see if the medicine they are testing worked better or was safer compared with placebo. the injections were given on day 1, day 8, and day 30 in the day group or on day 1, month 1, and month 6 in the month group. day 1 was the day that the first injection was given for both groups. the study included participants who were healthy and 65 to 85 years of age. the participants and most of the researchers did not know who received an injection of the c. difficile vaccine and who received placebo. this is known as a blinded study. the only person who knew what injection a participant was given was the person who gave the injection. volunteers were assigned to each group by chance alone. participants were put into 1 of the 6 treatment groups as shown in the table above. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups similar, which then makes comparing the results between the groups more fair. at the end of the original study, participants who received all 3 doses of the c. difficile vaccine were able to enter an extension study and receive a fourth dose of vaccine or placebo. this new study continued after the original study ended. while participants were only in the original study for 18 months if given the c. difficile vaccine in the month group or 13 months if given the c. difficile vaccine in the day group, the original study took almost 20 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 15 locations in the united states. it began on 16 july 2015 and ended on 07 march 2017. a total of 393 men and 461 women participated. all participants were between the ages of 65 and 85 years. of the 854 participants who started the study, 787 received all 3 doses of c. difficile vaccine or placebo and 740 finished the original study. in the month group, 427 participants (200 men and 227 women) received at least 1 dose, 412 (97%) received at least 2 doses, and 383 (90%) received all 3 doses. in the day group, 427 participants (193 men and 234 women) received at least 1 dose, 417 (97%) received at least 2 doses, and 404 (94%) received all 3 doses. a total of 114 participants left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for the participant to stop the study. as of 21 june 2017 (the data cutoff date for the original study), the sponsor began reviewing information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blinded study to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 antigen dose levels (100 g and 200 g total toxoid) of aluminum hydroxidecontaining C difficile vaccine administered as a 3-dose regimen: either at Days 1, 8, and 30 or Months 0, 1, and 6. Subjects will be assigned to 1 of the 2 dosing regimens and then randomly assigned in parallel in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive C difficile vaccine (100 g or 200 g total toxoid) or placebo (saline) (see Table 1). Subjects in both dosing regimens who received the first 3 doses of C difficile vaccine (100 g or 200 g) will be enrolled into an extension stage. These subjects will receive a fourth dose of either C difficile vaccine at the same antigen dose level (100 g or 200 g) as they received previously or placebo, approximately 1 year after their third dose. These subjects will be followed for a further 3 years (visits approximately every 6 months) to assess antibody persistence. Subjects originally randomized to placebo in either dosing regimen will not continue into the extension stage. 3.1. Approximate Number of Subjects Approximately 854 healthy adults, aged 65 to 85 years will be enrolled at approximately 15 sites in the United States. The number of subjects enrolled at each site may vary based on enrollment capabilities of each site. Subjects withdrawn from the study after randomization will not be replaced, regardless of the reason for withdrawal. 3.2. Approximate Duration of Subject Participation For the original portion of the study, subjects will be followed for 12 months after receipt of their third vaccination. Therefore, subjects assigned to the Day 1, 8, and 30 regimen will participate for approximately 13 months and those assigned to the Month 0, 1, and 6 regimen will participate for approximately 18 months. Subjects who enter the extension stage will be followed for a further 36 months. Therefore, subjects originally assigned to the Day 1, 8, and 30 regimen may participate for approximately 4 years and those assigned to the Month 0, 1, and 6 regimen will participate for approximately 4.5 years. 3.3. Approximate Duration of the Study The original portion of the study will be completed in approximately 21 months. The total duration of the study (including the extension stage) will be approximately 5 years. The end of the study is the last visit of the last subject as described in Section 13. 3.4. Vaccine Groups and Enrollment For the original portion of the study, subjects will be assigned to 1 of 6 study groups listed in Table 1. For each dosing regimen, approximately 366 subjects will receive the C difficile vaccine (at either 100 or 200 g total toxoid dose level) and approximately 61 subjects will receive placebo (saline). Table 1. Vaccine Groups and Number of Subjects per Group and per Dose Regimen a. Subjects in these groups will be asked to enter the extension stage. All eligible subjects who received 3 doses of C difficile vaccine (Groups 1, 2, 4, and 5) will be asked to enter the extension stage. Subjects enrolled in the extension stage will be rerandomized to receive a fourth dose of either C difficile vaccine at the same antigen dose level (100 g or 200 g) as they received previously or placebo."
" how was the study done? during part 1, researchers tested different doses of sasanlimab on a group of participants with solid tumors to learn about the safety of sasanlimab and find the best dose of sasanlimab to treat cancer in future trials. participants were given sasanlimab either by infusion into a vein (intravenously, or iv) at a dose of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg of body weight every 21 days, or 300 mg of sasanlimab by injection under the skin (subcutaneously, or sc) every 28 days. during part 2, researchers tested a group of participants with either non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) or cancer of the lining of the urinary tract (urothelial cancer, or uc) to learn more about the safety of sasanlimab. they also measured the size of the participants tumors to see if their cancer got better or worse during treatment. participants were given 300 mg of sasanlimab sc every 28 days. this study was open-label, meaning that the doctors and participants knew what treatment they were being given. the study design is shown in the graphics on the next page. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 55 locations in 8 countries in europe, asia, and north america. when did this study take place? it began on 10 february 2016 and ended on 19 november 2020. who participated in this study? part 1 of the study included adult participants who were diagnosed with certain types of solid tumors of the skin, head and neck, ovaries, connective tissues, lungs, or lining of the urinary tract that was locally advanced (the cancer had grown outside of the organ it had started in but had not yet spread to distant parts of the body) or metastatic (spread to distant parts of the body). part 2 of the study included adult participants who were diagnosed with either non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) or urothelial carcinoma (uc) that was locally advanced or metastatic (spread to other parts of the body).  a total of 12 men participated in part 1 and 78 men participated in part 2  a total of 28 women each participated in part 1 and part 2  all participants were between the ages of 26 and 88 of the 40 participants who started part 1 of the study and received sasanlimab, 1 finished treatment and 6 finished the study. of the 106 participants who started part 2 of the study and received sasanlimab, 10 finished treatment and 15 finished the study. the most common reason for participants stopping treatment during part 1 or part 2 was because their cancer got worse, and the most common reason for leaving the study was because the participant passed away. how long did the study last? study participants received an average of 12 cycles of treatment in part 1 of the study, and 9 cycles of treatment in part 2 of the study. the entire study took 4 years and 9 months to complete. when the study ended in november 2020, the sponsor reviewed the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

Part 2 dose expansion will include 2 arms: Arm 1 will enroll approximately 70 patients with NSCLC who progressed on or were intolerant to systemic therapy or for whom systemic therapy was refused or unavailable but have not previously received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. Arm 2 will enroll approximately 30 patients with urothelial cancer who progressed on or were intolerant to systemic therapy or for whom systemic therapy was refused or unavailable but have not previously received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. If the patient is seen in the clinic during the window of time that a scheduled telephone call is to be made to collect survival data, then the clinic visit may replace the survival telephone call. Part 1 Dose Escalation Part 1 will study sequential cohorts (0.5, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg IV, or 300 mg SC) of PF-06801591 in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, SCCHN, ovarian cancer, sarcoma, NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma, or other solid tumor types with clinical evidence of response to anti PD-1 or PD-L1 agents who are unresponsive to currently available therapies or for whom no standard therapy is available. Part 2 Dose Expansion Part 2 dose expansion will include 2 arms: Arm 1 will enroll approximately 70 patients with NSCLC who progressed on or were intolerant to systemic therapy or for whom systemic therapy was refused or unavailable but have not previously received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. Arm 2 will enroll approximately 30 patients with urothelial cancer who progressed on or were intolerant to systemic therapy or for whom systemic therapy was refused or unavailable but have not previously received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. The 300 mg SC dose level in Part 2 was selected based upon safety, PK, PD, and preliminary anti-tumor activity observed in Part 1, as well as the maximum injection volume considered feasible with the current formulation. When the first 30 NSCLC patients have been enrolled and have either completed their first tumor assessment (at approximately 8 weeks post treatment), or have discontinued from the study before their first scheduled tumor assessment, preliminary assessment of safety and efficacy data maybe completed. This preliminary data may provide guidance in the decision to the increase or decrease the sample size of each arm, to add other tumor types in a future amendment, or to initiate additional clinical studies. Starting Dose The initial starting dose of PF-06801591 IV (Part 1) is 0.5 mg/kg, to be given on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Table of Pre-Specified PF-06801591 IV Dose Levels The mTPI method relies upon a statistical probability algorithm, calculated using all patients treated in the current dose level to determine one of the following dose-finding decisions: the subsequent dose should be escalated, maintained at the current dose, or de-escalated in the next cohort of 2 to 4 patients (Part 1A), or the trial should be terminated (Table 3). However, if a patient discontinues close to Day 21 for reasons other than toxicity and due to an evident non drug-related event, the patient may be deemed evaluable for safety if safety assessments have been unremarkable and the investigator and sponsors medical monitor both agree that the patient is evaluable for DLT safety observation. 6 to 15 patients have been enrolled at a dose level that is predicted to be the MTD per the mTPI method; All dose levels explored appear to be overly toxic, and the MTD cannot be determined; 4. Dose-limiting Toxicity Definition Previous anti-PD-1 mAbs were administered in >1000 patients and were associated in the clinic with inflammatory adverse reactions resulting from increased or excessive immune activity (immune-mediated adverse reactions), likely to be related to the mechanism of action. For the purpose of a dose finding decision, any of the following drug-related AEs occurring during the first cycle of treatment (21 days for IV, or 28 days for SC) will be classified as DLTs following review by the investigators and the sponsor:  Grade 5 AE  Hematologic toxicity:  Any Grade 4 hematologic AE, with the following clarifications:  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >5 days from initiation of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. For any patient being treated at dose levels that are subsequently considered to exceed the MTD, the option to reduce their dose will be discussed between the investigator and the sponsors medical monitor. In practice, the MTD will be the highest dose associated with the occurrence of DLTs 33% (eg, 3 of 9 evaluable patients experience a DLT during at least [90 days after the first dose]) or the first 5 treatment cycles if the patient remains on treatment. Increased CD8+ T cell infiltration into melanoma tumor tissue has been observed in patients who exhibit a clinical response to PD-1 blockade.52 In this study, pharmacodynamic effects that will be monitored to support the identification of the OBD will include, but not be limited to, change from baseline in Ki-67 and HLA-DR expression on peripheral blood CD8+ T cells and intratumoral CD8+ T cell and FoxP3+ regulatory T cell density in response to dosing with PF-06801591. If anti-tumor efficacy and safety at this dose level is confirmed in Part 2, 300 mg SC q4w administration will be the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) chosen for further investigational study."
" this study included 2 groups of patients taking either:  standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus avelumab  standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus placebo a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but it looks just like the study medicine and is given the same way. the study included adult patients who:  had squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (in the mouth or throat) that was locally advanced  had cancer that was likely to spread or come back after treatment  were appropriate to receive standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin  had not yet received treatment for their cancer  had adequate liver, kidney, and bone marrow function the patients and researchers did not know who took avelumab and who took the placebo. this is known as a double-blinded study. potential patients were evaluated by the study doctor to make sure they met the criteria to participate in the study. this was known as the screening period. next, eligible patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups:  group a (350 patients): standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus avelumab  group b (347 patients): standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment plus placebo patients were assigned to each group by chance. putting people into groups by chance is called randomization. this helps make it more likely that the groups will be more even to compare before they start receiving the study treatments. avelumab and placebo were given by intravenous (iv) infusion (a needle into a vein). the study included 3 treatment phases:  7-day lead-in phase: patients received a single dose of avelumab or placebo on day 1  chemoradiotherapy phase: patients received avelumab or placebo on days 8, 25, or 39 plus standard radiation and chemotherapy treatment  maintenance phase: patients received avelumab or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 12 months maintenance treatment means a treatment that is given to stop cancer from coming back after it has been treated in the initial phase. after the last dose of maintenance treatment, there was a 90-day follow-up period that included regular safety assessments. there was a long-term follow-up period, which lasted until patients left the study or the study ended. the figure below shows what happened during this study. patients were expected to be on treatment for about 15 months, but the entire study lasted about 3 years. the sponsor ran this study at 196 locations in 22 countries in asia, australia, europe, and north america. the first patient was enrolled on 12 december 2016. 575 men (82%) and 122 women (18%) joined the study. patients in the study were between the ages of 26 and 86. patients were expected to complete the lead-in, chemoradiotherapy, maintenance, and follow-up phases of the study. the tables below show how many patients completed treatment phases and how many patients did not complete treatment phases either by their choice or because a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study.   in march 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," The study is designed with the primary objective of demonstrating that treatment with avelumab in combination with SOC CRT is superior to SOC CRT alone in prolonging PFS. One interim analysis for the assessment of PFS will be conducted to allow early stopping of the study for futility or to demonstrate early superiority of avelumab in combination with SOC CRT compared to SOC CRT alone, and to assess the safety of avelumab in combination with SOC CRT. b. Avelumab or placebo IV to be administered on Day 1 of the Lead-in Phase (1 week prior to the start of the CRT Phase), and on Days 8, 25, and 39 during the CRT Phase.  Lead-in Phase: On Day 1 of the Lead-in Phase of the study, patients will receive a single dose of avelumab or matching placebo, administered 7 days prior to initiation of the CRT Phase;  CRT Phase: Avelumab or matching placebo will be administered on Days 8, 25, and 39 in conjunction with SOC CRT starting on Day 1 of the CRT Phase;  Maintenance Phase: Following completion of the CRT Phase, avelumab or matching placebo will be administered Q2W for 12 months during the Maintenance Phase. Chemoradiation and Avelumab/Placebo Treatment Schedule a. Lead-in Phase to start 7 days prior to initiation of CRT Phase. Maintenance Phase to start after completion of the CRT Phase (ie, 2 weeks following completion of CRT) and be 12 months in duration. NOTE: The study consists of 3 study treatments: avelumab/placebo as study treatment 1; cisplatin as study treatment 2; IMRT as study treatment 3. Patients will receive study treatment until completion of the protocol-defined treatment period (ie, 12 months following completion of CRT Phase), PD per modified RECIST v1.1, patient withdrawal of consent, patient lost to follow-up, or until unacceptable toxicity occurs, or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. All patients will be followed for safety with evaluations through 90 days after the last study treatment administration or until the time of initiation of new systemic anticancer treatment. If any concern arises, the patient will be called in for a follow-up visit within 5 calendar days of the initial phone call for appropriate assessment (as per the investigators medical judgement). The investigator will assess antitumor activity based on radiological assessments and clinical evaluation of patients using modified RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 3) at baseline, 12 weeks after the completion of CRT, every 16 weeks (Q16W) thereafter for 48 months (208 weeks), and every 24 weeks (Q24W) thereafter until confirmed disease progression per modified RECIST v1.1 and regardless of discontinuation of study treatment or initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy. If treatment at the primary site is necessary after completion of CRT, study treatment has failed and the patient will discontinue the study treatment. A primary treatment neck dissection after completion of the CRT Phase will be defined as a neck dissection performed for residual disease and within 20 weeks (140 days) of completion of CRT. Such consolidation neck dissections after completion of the CRT Phase will encompass only the areas (typically only levels 2 and 3) initially involved in the side of the neck in question. In the case of negative PET in patients who did not achieve clinical or CT/MRI-based radiological nodal CR at the tumor assessment performed 12 weeks following completion of CRT, follow-up PET scans are recommended every 4 months (Q16W) with the CT imaging for 24 months, then every 6 months (Q24W) in Years 3-5, as well as careful recording of the clinical dimensions of the residual abnormality. Biomarker Assessments A key objective of the biomarker analyses that will be performed in this study is to investigate biomarkers that are potentially predictive of treatment benefit with the combination of avelumab and SOC CRT. Patient-Reported Outcomes Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) will be assessed using the NCCN FHNSI-2248 and the EQ-5D-5L49 CCI The maximum number of questions to be answered at any assessment is 30, so PRO collection is not expected to be burdensome to patients. The NCCN FHNSI-22 will be administered specifically to capture head and neck related (disease-related [DRS]) physical (DRS-P) and emotional symptoms (DRS-E), treatment side effects (TSE), and functional well-being (FWB), with a focus on the item I can swallow naturally and easily. CCI The EQ-5D-5L, FHNSI-22, CCI will be administered on Day 1 of the Lead-in Phase (baseline); Days 1 and 29 of the CRT Phase; on Day 1 Cycle 1 and Day 1 Cycle 3 during the Maintenance Phase; then Q16W for 48 months, then Q24W until PD per modified RECIST v1.1. NCCN-FHNSI-22 The NCCN FHNSI-22 was developed using methods consistent with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) PRO guidance50 and surveyed input from patients with advanced cancers and physician experts.48 The FHNSI-22 questionnaire is specifically designed to be a stand-alone instrument to measure disease symptoms, treatment side effects and overall quality of life in patients with head and neck cancer. EQ-5D-5L The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L is a patient-completed questionnaire designed to assess health status in terms of a single index value or utility score.49 There are 2 components to the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L: a descriptive system in which individuals rate their level of problems (none, slight, moderate, severe, extreme/unable) in 5 areas (mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in which patients rate their overall health status from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable)."
" this study compared 3 groups of patients to find out if patients taking pf-06651600 or pf-06700841 had their aa improved compared to patients taking placebo. a placebo does not have any medicine in it, but looks just like the medicine. the study included adult men and women who were aged 18 to 75 years. patients included in the study had moderate to severe aa with:  at least 50% hair loss on the scalp and no hair growing back within 6 monthscurrent episode of hair loss started less than 7 years ago.the patients and researchers did not know who took pf-06651600, who took pf-06700841 and who took the placebo. this was done to make sure that the trial results were not influenced in any way. this is known as a double-blinded study. patients were put into 1 of 3 treatment groups by chance alone (like the flip of a coin or drawing straws) to receive either pf-06651600, pf-06700841, or placebo. patients had a 33% (1 in 3) chance of receiving pf-06651600, a 33% (1 in 3) chance of receiving pf-06700841, and a 33% (1 in 3) chance of receiving placebo in the initial 24 weeks of the treatment period. this is known as a randomized study. this is done to make the groups more similar. reducing differences between the groups (like age or the number of men and women), makes the groups more even to compare. while patients were only in the study for 24 weeks for the first part of the study, the entire study took 29 months to complete. the sponsor ran this study at 55 locations in 3 countries in australia and north america. it began 15 december 2016 and ended 15 may 2019. forty-four (44) men and 98 women participated. all patients were between the ages of 18 and 68 years old. patients were to be treated until the end of week 24. of the 142 patients who started the study, 114 finished the initial 24-week treatment period. 8 patients did not finish the initial 24-week treatment period because of medical problems. twenty (20) patients stopped taking the study medication by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a patient to stop being in the study. when the study ended in may 2019, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

" how was the study done? researchers tested crisaborole ointment on a group of study participants to find out if study participants treated with crisaborole had fewer symptoms of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis than participants who used a vehicle ointment. researchers also wanted to see what would happen when hydrocortisone butyrate cream or pimecrolimus cream were used by participants instead of crisaborole ointment or vehicle ointment. participants went to the study center to be screened by the study doctor to make sure they were able to join the study. this was known as the screening period and this lasted up to 35 days. participants then entered the treatment period, which started on day 1 and lasted 28 days. during the treatment period, participants (or their parents or caregivers if the participant was a child) were to apply the ointment or cream twice a day to an area or areas of skin affected by the atopic dermatitis. the study participants and researchers did not know who used the crisaborole ointment and who used the vehicle ointment. study participants would have been able to tell if they were given an ointment instead of one of the comparator creams as the treatment would have felt different. a comparator treatment is usually a treatment that is commonly given to participants with the disease being investigated. in this study, hydrocortisone butyrate cream and pimecrolimus cream were the comparator creams. the study doctors who looked at the participants skin to assess how the treatment was working did not know what treatment each participant had been given. this is known as an assessor blinded study. study participants were assigned to treatment with crisaborole ointment, vehicle ointment, or the comparator treatment by chance alone. this was done to make sure that the study results were not influenced in any way. each participant visited the study center on day 1, day 8, day 15, day 22, and day 29 for the study doctors to assess their atopic dermatitis and their general health. participants were not treated on or after day 29 but were to remain in the study until day 60. the participants visited the study center on day 43 for the final study assessments. if the participant stopped treatment early, these final study assessments were done 14 days after they last used the treatment. participants then received a follow-up telephone call on day 60 (or a month after their last treatment if the participant stopped treatment early). this telephone call was to check for any medical problems. this was considered the end of the study. the following figure shows what happened during this study.  where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 26 locations in 7 countries in europe and in the us. when did this study take place? it began on 14 may 2018 and ended on 11 december 2020. who participated in this study? the study included participants who were 2 years or older and who had mild or moderate atopic dermatitis.  a total of 30 men and 66 boys participated  a total of 61 women and 78 girls participated  all participants were between the ages of 2 and 78 years. participants were to be treated for 28 days. of the 235 participants who started the study, 207 completed the treatment period, and 217 finished the study. there were 28 participants who did not finish the treatment period because of:  medical problems (11 participants)  not wanting to continue with treatment (13 participants)  not thinking the treatment was working (3 participants), or  other reasons (1 participant) there were 18 participants who left before the study was over by their choice or a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study. how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for 60 days or approximately 2 months. the entire study took around 2 years and 7 months to complete. pfizer stopped this study before the planned end due to a business decision and not because of any concerns about how well crisaborole ointment worked in clinical studies or due to safety problems. as not all the planned participants were able to join the study because it was stopped early, the researchers did not have enough data for their analyses. this meant the researchers were not able to compare the different treatments used in this study. when the study ended in december 2020, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report.

STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3b/4, multicenter, randomized, assessor blinded, vehicle and active (TCS and TCI) controlled study of the efficacy, safety and local tolerability of crisaborole ointment, 2% in pediatric and adult subjects, ages 2 years and older, with mild to moderate AD involving at least 5% treatable %BSA. Treatment will be clinical assessor-blinded for all treatment arms and double-blinded for crisaborole ointment, 2% and vehicle treatment arms. A total of approximately 600 subjects will be enrolled in the study, of which at least 150 subjects aged 2-6; at least 140 subjects aged 7-11; at least 120 subjects aged 12-17 and up to 90 subjects will be adults. Following the screening period (up to 35 days prior to Baseline/Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomized at the Baseline/Day 1 visit. Randomization will be stratified by eligibility for TCS or TCI treatment as per national approved labels and eligibility provided in Section 4. Cohort 1 will be for subjects who are eligible for TCS therapy, and Cohort 2 will be for subjects who are not eligible for TCS therapy but eligible for TCI therapy. The investigational product will be applied BID for 28 days to the Treatable BSA identified at Baseline/Day 1. Any new AD on treatment-eligible locations occurring following Baseline/Day 1 should also be treated with the study drug after consultation with the Investigator at the next visit. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline in the EASI total score at For the efficacy comparison of crisaborole versus vehicle, subjects from both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 are included in the analysis, adjusted for cohort effect. For the efficacy comparison of crisaborole versus TCS, only subjects from Cohort 1 are included in the analysis. For the comparison of crisaborole versus TCI, only subjects from Cohort 2 are included in the analysis. Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted at the investigator site by a clinical assessor blinded for treatment arms. A sub-study will be conducted at selected investigator sites to evaluate differences of changes in epidermal skin thickness as measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) between treatment groups in Cohort 1. (see Appendix 4). Scheduled study visits for all subjects will occur at Screening, Baseline/Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 (End of treatment/Early termination) and Day 43 or 14 Days after last dose if subject is terminated early from treatment. A follow up telephone call will be made by site staff to the subjects/caregivers on Day 60 or at least 28 days after last dose if subject is terminated early from treatment. Subjects enrolled in the OCT sub-study will attend the clinic on Day 60 and do not require a telephone call on Day 60. A schematic of the study design is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.

Subjects will be observed for 30 minutes after each dose of c7vPnC in Groups 1 and 2, and after Prevnar 13 and the Supplemental Dose of c7vPnC in Group 3. In all groups, prompted local reactions (pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site), systemic events (fever, decreased appetite, drowsiness/increased sleep, and irritability), and use of antipyretic/pain medications occurring within 7 days after Doses 1 to 4 and the Supplemental Dose will be collected each day in the electronic diary (e-diary). SAEs and NDCMCs will be collected for the entire duration of the study. AEs (including nonserious AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs) will be collected from the signing of the informed consent document to 1 month after Dose 3 and from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4 or 1 month after the Supplemental Dose in Group 3. Approximately 6 months after Dose 4 or the Supplemental Dose, the sites will contact the subjects legally acceptable representative via telephone to inquire about SAEs and NDCMCs. Blood will be drawn for immunogenicity assessments 1 month after Dose 3, prior to receipt of Dose 4, and 1 month after Dose 4 CCI . In Group 2, blood will also be collected prior to Dose 3. CCI 3.1. Duration of Subject Participation Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 16 to 17 months. 3.2.

RSV Vaccine Month-0, Month-2 Cohort will evaluate a 240 g dose of RSV vaccine with CpG/Al(OH) given at Months 0 and 2. 3 Male and female subjects 65 to 85 years of age will be enrolled. The RSV Vaccine Month-0, Month-2 Cohort will be randomized 1:1 to receive RSV vaccine or placebo. Primary Study Cohort - Stage 1 Enrollment in the Primary Study Cohort - Stage 1 commenced in April 2019 and completed enrollment in June 2019. Approximately 250 subjects 65 to 85 years of age received 2 intramuscular injections at Visit 1 to assess the concomitant administration of SIIV when given to subjects receiving one of the 3 RSV vaccine dose-level candidates formulated with Al(OH) or CpG/Al(OH) or the RSV vaccinealone dose (see Section 6.1 for further 3 3 details). The first 4 subjects vaccinated in the study were observed by blinded site staff for any acute reactions for at least 4 hours after vaccination. Vaccination of the remaining subjects commenced no sooner than 48 hours after the fourth subject received his or her vaccination. Vaccination of subjects was limited to a maximum of 6 subjects per day during the first week of enrollment (up to 30 vaccinated subjects in total). Follow-up will continue through Primary Study Cohort - Stage 2 Prior to completion of Stage 1, subjects may be invited to participate in Stage 2. Safety and immunogenicity data obtained from the C3671001 and C3671002 studies will be used to determine whether Stage 2 will proceed and, if so, whether all or some of the RSV formulations will be evaluated. If the data support implementation of Stage 2, consenting subjects will be revaccinated with the same dose and formulation of the RSV vaccine or placebo received at Visit 1, concomitantly with SIIV. The safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the second dose will be evaluated through 12 months after revaccination. If the data do not support the implementation of revaccination at 12 months, Stage 2 will not proceed. RSV Vaccine Month-0, Month-2 Cohort Approximately 62 RSV vaccine-naive subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 240 g of RSV vaccine with CpG/Al(OH) or placebo at Visit 1 (Month 0). At Visit 3 3 (Month 2), subjects will receive a second dose of RSV vaccine or placebo as randomized at Visit 1. In Stage 1, the 240-g dose for the nonadjuvanted RSV vaccine was selected based on the 1-month postvaccination immunogenicity data from the sentinel-cohort subjects in Study C3671001. The same dose will be used for the RSV Vaccine Month-0, Month-2 Cohort. Number of Subjects In total, approximately 312 subjects will be randomized to receive RSV vaccine at different dose levels and formulations or placebo at different vaccination schedules. Approximately 250 subjects were enrolled in the Primary Study Cohort - Stage 1 and approximately 62 RSV vaccine-naive subjects will be enrolled in the RSV Vaccine Month-0, Month-2 Cohort (see Table 4 below). Of these, a subset of subjects in all cohorts will be included in the whole blood collection procedural requirements for the exploratory cellular analysis endpoints for this study. Those sites that have access to the appropriate specimen-processing laboratories will provide all subjects for the PBMC collection subset. It is anticipated that the subjects from the selected sites will constitute approximately 1/3 of the total number of randomized subjects. Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study after randomization will not be replaced, regardless of the reason for withdrawal. Randomization of Subjects by Dose and Formulation Abbreviations: Al(OH) = aluminum hydroxide; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus vaccine; SIIV = seasonal 3 inactivated influenza vaccine. Primary Study Cohort - Stage 2 is contingent on supporting data from Stage 1 and applies to invited/consenting subjects only. Duration of Subject Participation Subjects enrolled in the Primary Study Cohort - Stage 1 will participate in the study for approximately 12 months, or up to approximately 24 months if completing Stage 2. Subjects enrolled in the RSV Vaccine Month-0, Month-2 Cohort will participate in the study for approximately 14 months. The study is dependent on SIIV availability and access to subjects who have not received SIIV within the preceding 6 months. It is anticipated that the study will be conducted in the same geographic location; however, if required for operational reasons, this study may be conducted in more than 1 geographic location over more than 1 influenza season."
" how was the study done? researchers tested ritlecitinib on a group of study participants to find out if study participants taking ritlecitinib had a better response as measured by the severity alopecia tool (salt) in comparison to placebo at week 24. following week 24, participants taking placebo were switched to ritlecitinib during the extension period. the salt score measures the severity of alopecia by capturing the percentage of hair loss. it was calculated by dividing the scalp into 4 quadrants with allocated percentage scalp surface area in each area. the study was carried out as shown in figure 1 below. figure 1: overall study design the study participants and researchers did not know who took ritlecitinib, what dosage was received, or who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 118 locations in argentina, australia, canada, chile, china, colombia, czech republic, germany, hungary, japan, mexico, poland, russia, spain, south korea, taiwan, united kingdom, and the united states. when did this study take place? it began 03 december 2018 and ended 24 june 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who:  had a primary diagnosis of alopecia areata  had at least 50% hair loss on their scalp  were currently experiencing hair loss on their scalp  were at least 12 years old or older, depending on the study location a total of 1097 participants were screened, and 718 participants were randomized or assigned to a treatment group by chance.  a total of 272 males participated.  a total of 446 females participated.  six hundred and thirteen out of 718 (85%) of participants were at least 18 years old. participants were to be treated until the planned end of treatment at 48 weeks. of the 718 participants who started the study, 614 participants completed the study treatment. three participants were not treated, and 101 participants did not finish the study because:  the participant left by their own choice,  the participant experienced a medical problem,  the participant discovered they were pregnant,  a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study,  the participant could not be contacted,  the treatment did not work for them,  a protocol deviation occurred (an unplanned change from the study design),  the participant was non-compliant while taking the study medication,  or for other reasons. how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for approximately 57 weeks. the entire study took approximately 2 years to complete. when the last participants last visit occurred in june 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," STUDY DESIGN Study B7981015 will investigate PF-06651600 in subjects with moderate to severe AA. This is a Phase 2b/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study. The study will have a maximum duration of approximately 57 weeks. This includes an up to 5-week Screening period, a 48-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period as shown in Figure 1. The treatment period will be comprised of a placebo-controlled period that includes a 4-week loading phase and a 20-week maintenance phase, followed by a 24-week extension phase. The study will enroll a total of approximately 660 subjects. The study will be conducted at approximately 120 sites. To be eligible to enroll in this study, subjects must have moderate to severe AA with 50% hair loss of the scalp (SALT score 50) at both Screening and baseline visits, without evidence of terminal hair regrowth within the previous 6 months and with the current episode of hair loss 10 years. The full list of eligibility criteria for the study is included in Section 4. Screening will occur within 35 days prior to the first dose of study drug to confirm that subjects meet selection criteria for the study. Photographs will be taken at the Screening Visit to verify eligibility (AA with 50% hair loss of the scalp). Eligible subjects will be randomized as described below. A stratified randomization will be used for operational purposes in order to achieve a target global composition for AT/AU and adolescent subjects in the enrolled population. The targets for enrollment are approximately 40% AT/AU and approximately 15% adolescents. The randomization will be operationalized as follows. In regions enrolling both adolescents and adults, there will be four strata: <18 years of age and AT/AU; <18 years of age and not AT/AU; 18 years of age and AT/AU; and 18 years of age and not AT/AU. Within each of these strata, subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:2:2:1:1:1 manner to blinded PF-06651600 and matching placebo for a total of 7 treatment sequences. In regions enrolling only adults, there will be two strata: 18 years of age and AT/AU; and 18 years of age and not AT/AU. In these regions, subjects will be randomized using the same ratio as described for regions enrolling both adolescents and adults. Figure 1 provides a schematic of the study design and the 7 treatment sequences. All subjects will begin dosing during the loading period according to their assigned sequence. Following the 4-week loading period, subjects will continue dosing according to their assigned sequence in the 20-week maintenance period. At the end of the maintenance period, placebo-treated subjects will be advanced in a prespecified, blinded manner to one of two active treatment sequences for the remainder of the study (through Week 48). Investigators, subjects, and the sponsor study team will be blinded as to treatment group throughout the duration of the study. Following the last dose of study drug, both discontinued and completed subjects will enter into a 4-week follow-up period for safety monitoring. Subjects who complete treatment may be eligible for enrollment in a long-term study (Phase 3 study B7981032). Subjects who enroll immediately into the B7981032 study will not be required to complete the 4-week follow-up period in this study. Figure 1.

" how was the study done? researchers administered etrasimod or placebo to a group of participants who chose to join the study, to find out if they would achieve clinical remission. researchers compared the results of study participants taking etrasimod to the results of study participants taking placebo. participants received the following treatments during the study:  etrasimod group (289 participants): 2 milligram (mg) etrasimod tablet, once per day by mouth for up to 52 weeks  placebo group (144 participants): placebo tablet, once per day by mouth for up to 52 weeks the study participants and researchers did not know who took etrasimod and who took the placebo. this is known as a blinded study. study participants were assigned to each group by chance alone, which is known as randomization. participants were first examined by a doctor to make sure they met the requirements to join the study. this was known as the screening period. there were 2 treatment periods during this study: a 12-week induction period to determine if participants would achieve remission, followed by a 40-week maintenance period to determine how long participants would remain in remission. during the 52 weeks of treatment, participants were expected to attend 12 visits at the study center. at these visits, participants were checked by the study doctor and were monitored for any medical problems. participants also had an endoscopy at the screening visit, week 12 visit, and the last visit, to see if there was an improvement in their uc. at the end of this study, qualifying participants had the option to enter an open-label extension study, which is a study that is sometimes done after a randomized study is completed, to gather additional data and to allow participants to continue receiving etrasimod. open-label means that the study participants and researchers knew which treatment the participants received (in this case, all participants received etrasimod in the extension study). participants who did not join the open-label extension study were expected to attend up to 2 visits after stopping study treatment to check whether they had any medical problems. these are called follow-up visits. the figure below shows what happened during the study. where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 185 locations in africa, asia-pacific, eastern europe, latin america, the middle east, north america, and western europe. when did this study take place? the study began 13 june 2019 and ended 16 february 2022. who participated in this study? this study included participants who:  were examined by the study doctor and determined to be appropriate for study participation  had been diagnosed with moderately to severely active uc  had an inadequate response, loss of response, or were unable to tolerate certain other marketed treatments for uc  a total of 240 men (55%) participated in the study  a total of 193 women (45%) participated in the study  all participants were between the ages of 17 and 78 years a total of 433participants enrolled in this study, including 289 participants in the etrasimod group and 144 participants in the placebo group. 207 participants (48%) completed the study, including 161 participants (56%) in the etrasimod group and 46 participants (32%) in the placebo group. 226 participants (52%) left the study early. in the etrasimod group, 128 participants (44%) left the study early due to:  ulcerative colitis worsened (79 participants, 27%)  the participants or parent/guardians choice (24 participants, 8%)  the participant had a medical problem (10 participants, 4%)  the study treatment did not work for the participant (7 participants, 2%)  a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study (2 participants, 1%)  the participant was lost to follow-up (unable to be contacted by the study staff) (1 participant, less than 1%)  the participant became pregnant (2 participants, 1%)  the study procedures were not followed (1 participant, less than 1%)  other reason (2 participants, 1%) in the placebo group, 98 participants (68%) left the study early due to:  ulcerative colitis worsened (73 participants, 51%)  the participants or parent/guardians choice (10 participants, 7%)  the participant had a medical problem (5 participants, 4%)  the study treatment did not work for the participant (4 participants, 3%)  a doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study (2 participants, 1%)  the participant was lost to follow-up (unable to be contacted by the study staff) (2 participants, 1%)  other reason (2 participants, 1%) how long did the study last? study participants were in the study for up to 52 weeks, plus a screening period of up to 28 days and a follow-up period of up to 4 weeks (for those who did not join the open-label extension study). the entire study took about 2  years to complete. when the study ended in february 2022, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Summary of Study Design This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod 2 mg in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. The study consists of a 28-Day Screening Period, a 12-Week Treatment Period, a 40-Week Treatment Period, and a 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up Period (Figure 1). Eligible subjects will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either etrasimod (2 mg once daily) or matching placebo (once daily) in a double-blind fashion for up to 52 weeks of treatment (12-Week Treatment Period + 40-Week Treatment Period). Randomization will be stratified by (a) nave to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy at study entry (yes or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and (c) baseline disease activity (modified Mayo score [MMS]: 4 to 6 or 7 to 9). Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to a biologic or JAK inhibitor (subjects in this category may have received prior conventional therapy). Entry criteria will be based on confirmation of moderately to severely active UC, defined by an MMS of 4 to 9, which includes an endoscopic score (ES)  2 and rectal bleeding (RB) score  1. At the end of the 12-Week Treatment Period, subjects will undergo Week 12 efficacy and safety assessments and be evaluated for clinical response/remission as well as UC disease worsening. Subjects whose UC condition in the opinion of the Investigator has not improved or has worsened, compared with baseline (Week 0/Day 1), as defined in Section 5.1.1 and who meet other eligibility criteria will have the option to enter an OLE study (Study APD334-303). Subjects who do not meet disease worsening criteria, including those demonstrating clinical response/remission at Week 12 will continue into the 40-Week Treatment Period and continue their double-blind treatment. Disease worsening will continue to be monitored by Investigators through the 40-Week Treatment Period (ie, from Weeks 13 to 52). Subjects who either experience disease worsening in the 40-Week Treatment Period or complete all study procedures at Week 52 will have the option to enroll into the OLE study if they meet all eligibility criteria. Subjects who discontinue from the study and do not participate in the OLE study will have 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up visits after the last on-treatment visit/Early Termination visit (Table 7). Rationale for Study Design This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in subjects with preexisting background therapy is allowed, a placebo comparator is justified. The duration of study treatment is up to 52 weeks, which includes 12- and 40-Week Treatment Periods. The 40-Week Treatment Period is expected to provide adequate time for separation of efficacy effects between etrasimod and placebo. The etrasimod dose of 2 mg once daily is based on findings of previous Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, and in particular data from the Phase 2 APD334-003 placebo-controlled study. Subjects in the etrasimod 2 mg group experienced a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, the mean difference from placebo at Week 12 in the adapted Mayo score (least squares mean [standard error] difference: 0.99 [0.42]; p = 0.0091) compared with placebo. The etrasimod 2 mg group also experienced significant improvement in all secondary endpoints compared with the placebo group at Week 12 including, improvement in the total Mayo Score (estimated least squares mean [standard error] difference from placebo: 1.27 [0.55]; p = 0.0100), and higher percentage of subjects with endoscopic improvement (41.8%, difference from placebo: 24.4%, p = 0.003). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the 1 mg, 2 mg, and placebo groups were reported for 59.6%, 56.0%, and 50.0% of subjects, respectively; treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 7.7%, 10.0%, and 5.6% of subjects, respectively; serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for 5.8%, 0%, and 11.1% of subjects, respectively; and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were reported for 5.8%, 8.0%, and 0% of subjects, respectively. The coprimary endpoints of clinical remission at Weeks 12 and 52 as assessed using the MMS, are standard, widely used, and are in accordance with the nonbinding US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Draft Guidance for Industry, Ulcerative Colitis: Clinical Trials Endpoints (FDA 2016). As detailed in Section 10.2, the study is powered to the primary endpoint for demonstrating a statistically significant difference in clinical remission between etrasimod therapy and placebo at Week 52. Subjects meeting predefined eligibility criteria from the end of the 12-Week Treatment Period and during the 40-Week Treatment Period will be eligible to enter the APD334-303 OLE study (Section 5.1.1) provided they meet all entry criteria. Study Duration The study consists of a 28-Day Screening Period, a 12-Week Treatment Period, a 40-Week Treatment Period, and a 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up Period. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be utilized to monitor the safety of subjects and to enhance the integrity and credibility of the study. As part of its role, the DMC will conduct reviews of accumulating safety and efficacy data at specified intervals during the conduct of the trial, according to the guidelines detailed in the DMC Charter. To ensure the scientific integrity of the study, members of the DMC will not be directly involved in the ongoing management of the study."
" figure 2. what were the treatment groups? where did this study take place? the sponsor ran this study at 55 study sites in 3 countries (canada, poland, and united states of america). when did this study take place? it began 28 september 2020 and ended 06 december 2021. who participated in this study? the study included participants who were 40 years old or above, had abnormal levels of cholesterol and tg in the blood, and were on a stable dose of a statin. the study did not allow those who had medical conditions such as an active liver disease or high blood pressure that could not be controlled with treatment. in total, 160 men and 126 women joined the study. all participants were between the ages of 40 and 88 years. participants were to be treated for 24 weeks. of the 286 participants who started the study, 226 finished the treatment period. sixty (60) participants did not finish the treatment period. the most common reason was because of a medical problem they had during the study. other reasons were:  a study doctor decided it was best for a participant to stop being in the study.  participants left by their choice before the study was over.  participants took medicines that were not allowed during the study. how long did the study last? participants were in the study for about 36 weeks. the entire study took about 1 year and 2 months to finish. when the study ended in december 2021, the sponsor began reviewing the information collected. the sponsor then created a report of the results. this is a summary of that report. "," Overall Design This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, 8-arm parallel-group study in adults 40 years of age with dyslipidemia who are on a stable dose of a statin (with or without ezetimibe). Following the Screening Period to confirm eligibility, a total of approximately 260 participants will be randomized in the study to receive SC doses of vupanorsen or placebo administered Q2W or Q4W for the purpose of assessing efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vupanorsen. The total duration of treatment in the study is 24 weeks with an additional 12-week safety follow-up period. The sponsor, along with academic leadership of the study (TIMI Study Group), will monitor the proportion of participants enrolled according to statin intensity to ensure that an adequate number of participants on high intensity statin are enrolled. Approximately 40% or more of participants enrolled should be on high intensity statin therapy, and enrollment of participants using low/moderate intensity statin may be capped. Dosing Plan Treatment arm will be capped at 10 participants until E-DMC performs unblinded data review and recommends whether enrollment should be re-opened for this dose group for the remaining 30 participants. During the Screening Period, sites will instruct participants or caregivers how to perform the SC injection, and participants (or caregivers) willing to perform the injection will be assessed for ability to inject correctly. Participants receiving Q2W injections will self-administer study intervention (or be injected by their caregiver) on-site when study visits coincide with the dosing interval (Weeks 2 and 6, and at designated monthly visits). The study site will dispense study intervention for the participant or caregiver to inject at home for the doses that do not coincide with a study visit (Weeks 10, 14, 18, and 22). HFF will be assessed at Screening and Week 24 using MRI-PDFF, and blood samples will be collected for lipids, lipoproteins, PK, PD, hsCRP, and anti-vupanorsen antibodies at various time points during the study according to the SoA. This study will include an E-DMC who will be responsible for ongoing, unblinded monitoring of efficacy and the safety of participants in the study according to the E-DMC charter (Section 9.6). Following unblinded data review by the E-DMC as described in the E-DMC charter, enrollment in this treatment arm may be re-opened for the remaining 30 participants or be stopped based on recommendation by the E-DMC. The interim analysis will take place approximately 16 weeks after 50% of the planned participants (ie, approximately 110 participants), with exception of the 160 mg Q2W group, are randomized. Efficacy and safety analyses will occur when all participants either complete 24 weeks of study participation or discontinue study participation. Scientific Rationale for Study Design As reviewed in the IB, vupanorsen demonstrated significant reductions in TG and multiple lipid endpoints in the Phase 2a study in participants with hypertriglyceridemia, NAFLD, and diabetes; however, the maximal reduction in ANGPTL3 achieved with the highest dose of 80 mg Q4W in the study was below the magnitude needed to observe maximal lipid lowering with this mechanism (ie, 75% ANGPTL3 reduction). In the current study, the participant population is focused on those with elevated non-HDL-C and TG and are on a stable dose of a statin to determine the optimum dose for future development for hypertriglyceridemia and CV risk reduction. The risk of vupanorsen causing damage to the DNA of sperm is considered low, and the risk of exposure to vupanorsen in a sexual partner of a male participant in this study via ejaculate is low; therefore, no contraception (condom) use in male participants is required (see Appendix 4). The highest dose of vupanorsen planned for this study would result in maternal systemic exposures via seminal transfer well below (>5000-fold) the exposure at the NOAEL for developmental toxicity in nonclinical studies, including the conservative assumptions that an ASO ejaculate:serum ratio would be 1 and there is 100% uptake by the partner. Justification for Dose A dose range of 80 mg Q4W to 160 mg Q2W will be evaluated for safety and efficacy in this study. Based on simulation results using a preliminary population PK/PD model developed from the combined data in the Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies, vupanorsen 80 mg Q4W is expected to be a minimal efficacious dose in non-HDL-C reduction (<8% probability of achieving 35% mean reduction) and is included to bridge the data from previous studies. Both Q2W and Q4W dosing regimens are included for the total monthly doses of 120 mg and 160 mg in order to discern if there is any effect of dosing frequency or any effect of maximum single dose administered at one time on the frequency of AEs. Single doses of vupanorsen up to 120 mg SC and multiple doses up to 60 mg SC QW for 6 doses (total exposure of 360 mg) were safe and well-tolerated in healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 study. At the highest multiple dose administered (60 mg QW), 2 out of 6 participants had elevations in liver enzymes, with 1 participant exceeding >3  ULN and without elevation in bilirubin. There were observations in the vupanorsen-treated participants that were not considered safety issues but warrant additional study in a larger sample size to understand if they are related to vupanorsen administration or could reflect a stochastic finding. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including follow-up visit. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study."
