Efficacy Evaluations: Efficacy evaluations included changes from baseline for the NIS subscales, Norfolk TQOL score, the BMI, and mBMI with increases from baseline indicative of worsening condition. Karnofsky Performance Status Scale scores were obtained from participants who had valine replaced by methionine in position 30 of the TTR protein (Val30Met), and change from baseline was assessed for non-Val30Met participants with lower scores and decreases from baseline indicative of worsening performance status. Assessment of ambulatory status was also performed. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Evaluations: Not applicable. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events, time to death analysis, laboratory safety tests, vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations. Use of concomitant medications was summarized. Statistical Methods: Safety and efficacy data are summarized using descriptive statistics. The data are summarized separately for Val30Met participants and non-Val30Met participants. Val30Met participants are presented by treatment group: tafamidis/tafamidis (T-T) and placebo/tafamidis (P-T). T-T participants were randomized to tafamidis in the Fx-005 parent study (B3461020) and continued tafamidis in Study Fx-006 (B3461021) and Study B3461023. P-T participants were randomized to placebo for 18 months in Study Fx-005 (B3461020) and assigned to receive tafamidis in Study Fx-006 (B3461021) and Study B3461023. Baseline was used as a covariate in the change from baseline models and where appropriate. The baseline for efficacy endpoints was the last measurement prior to the first dose of study drug in Study B3461020 (Fx-005) for Val30Met participants and in Study B3461022 (Fx1A-201) for non-Val30Met participants. For Val30Met participants, data from baseline to Month 18 are from Study B3461020 (Fx-005); data after Month 18 through Month 30 are from Study Fx-006 (B3461021); and data after Month 30 are from Study B3461023. A repeated measures analysis of covariance model with change from baseline as the dependent variable, a compound symmetry covariance matrix, treatment, month and treatment-by- month as fixed effects, baseline as a covariate, and participant as a random effect in the model was used to estimate the least square (LS) means and confidence intervals (CIs). For non-Val30Met participants, data from baseline to Month 12 are from Study B3461022 (Fx1A-201), and data after Month 12 are from Study B3461023. A repeated measures analysis of covariance model with change from baseline as the dependent variable, a compound symmetry covariance matrix, month as a fixed effect, baseline as a covariate, and participant as a random effect in the model was used to estimate the LS means and CIs. The distribution of time to the next ambulatory stage from the first dose of treatment was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between treatment groups by the log-rank test. Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to death from the first dose of treatment included all deaths in the clinical database, including those following transplant (liver and/or heart) or discontinuation, through the follow-up contact 30 days after the last dose of study drug. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition is presented in Table S3. Of the 93 participants enrolled in this study, 47 (50.5%) were female and 46 (49.5%) were male. Most participants were Caucasian (84/93 participants; 90.3%). Other races included Latino American (8/93 participants; 8.6%) and Afro-Caribbean (1/93 participants; 1.1%). Compared to Val30Met participants, non-Val30Met participants had a higher baseline mean age (T-T: 40.7 years; P-T: 38.6 years; non-Val30Met: 63.6 years), a longer mean symptom duration (T-T: 45.2 months; P-T: 33.9 months; non-Val30Met: 66.9 months), a higher baseline mean NIS-LL Total Score (T-T: 6.8; P-T: 11.6; non-Val30Met: 31.1), and a higher baseline mean Norfolk TQOL score (T-T: 24.1; P-T: 29.9; non-Val30Met: 53.9).

Completed subjects are those whose participation ended due to gaining access for tafamidis 20 mg by prescription for ATTR-PN indication. Efficacy Results: NIS-LL Total Score Mean NIS-LL Total Score at baseline was 6.8 for the T-T Val30Met group and 11.6 for the P-T Val30Met group, indicating impairment in lower limbs. Both groups had some worsening in impairment of lower limbs at Month 6 to Month 66, but the T-T group had numerically smaller increases from baseline compared to the P-T group. Mean NIS-LL Total Score at baseline was 31.1 for the non-Val30Met group, indicating presence of impairment in lower limbs. There was some worsening in impairment of lower limbs from Month 12 to Month 60, as demonstrated by gradual LS mean increases from baseline. NIS-LL-MW Mean NIS-LL-MW scores at baseline were 2.1 for the T-T Val30Met group and 4.2 for the P-T Val30Met group, indicating lower limb muscle weakness. The NIS-LL-MW scores in both groups displayed a pattern of change over time similar to the NIS-LL Total Score. Both groups demonstrated some worsening of lower limb muscle weakness to Month 66, but the T-T group had numerically smaller increases from baseline compared to the P-T group. Mean NIS-LL-MW score at baseline was 16.6 for the non-Val30Met group, indicating lower limb muscle weakness. There was some worsening of lower limb muscle weakness from Month 12 to Month 60, as demonstrated by LS mean increases from baseline. NIS-LL Reflexes Mean NIS-LL Reflexes scores at baseline were 0.8 for the T-T Val30Met group and 1.8 for the P-T Val30Met group, indicating impairment in lower limb reflexes. Both groups had some worsening of lower limb reflexes from Month 6 to Month 66, as demonstrated by small LS mean increases from baseline. The increase from baseline was similar between the T-T and P-T groups. Mean NIS-LL Reflexes score at baseline was 5.6 for the non-Val30Met group, indicating impairment in lower limb reflexes. There was a small decrease from baseline at Month 6 and Month 12 followed by worsening of lower limb reflexes at Month 24 to Month 60, as demonstrated by LS mean increases from baseline in NIS-LL Reflexes score. NIS-LL Sensory Mean NIS-LL Sensory scores at baseline were 3.9 for the T-T Val30Met group and 5.6 for the P-T Val30Met group, indicating impairment in lower limb sensation. Both groups had some worsening of lower limb sensation from Month 6 and at Month 18 to Month 66 as demonstrated by small LS mean increases from baseline. The increase from baseline was similar between the T-T and P-T groups. Mean NIS-LL Sensory score at baseline was 8.9 for the non-Val30Met group, indicating impairment in lower limb sensation. There was a small decrease from baseline at Month 6 followed by worsening of lower limb sensation from Month 12 to Month 60 as demonstrated by LS mean increases from baseline in NIS-LL Sensory score. Norfolk TQOL Score Mean TQOL scores at baseline were 24.1 for the T-T Val30Met group and 29.9 for the P-T Val30Met group, indicating impaired quality of life. There were small changes from baseline to Month 30 in the T-T group (LS mean change range of -3.2 [Month 24] to 0.1 [Month 30]), followed by increases from baseline from Month 42 to Month 66 (LS mean changes of 3.2, 3.0, 5.2 at Months 42, 54, 66, respectively). There were increases from baseline from Month 12 to Month 66 in the P-T group (LS mean change range of 1.8 [Month 42] to 6.4 [Month 18]); the increases from baseline from Month 42 to Month 66 (LS mean changes of 1.8, 2.1, 5.3 at Months 42, 54, 66, respectively) resulted in mean scores similar to the T-T group. Mean TQOL score at baseline was 53.9 for the non-Val30Met group, indicating impaired quality of life. Quality of life worsened from Month 12 to Month 60, as demonstrated by LS mean increases from baseline in TQOL score. Karnofsky Performance Status Scale For Val30Met participants, the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale was collected in this study beginning at Month 30. Mean Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score at Month 30 was 83.8 for the T-T Val30Met group and 80.3 for the Val30Met P-T group, indicating impairment in functional performance consistent with “normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease.” Both groups had some improvement in performance by Month 54 compared to Month 30 as demonstrated by small mean score increases. At Month 66, the mean score increased slightly in the T-T group and decreased slightly in the P-T group compared to Month 30. In the T-T group, the mean score was unchanged at Month 42 and increased at Month 54 and Month 66 compared to Month 30. In the P-T group, the mean score increased at Month 42 and Month 54 followed by a decrease at Month 66 compared to Month 30. Mean Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score at baseline was 72.2 for the non-Val30Met group, indicating impairment in functional performance. Performance gradually worsened from Month 6 to Month 60. Body Mass Index Mean BMI at baseline was 23.5 kg/m2 for the T-T Val30Met group and 24.1 kg/m2 for the P-T Val30Met group. In the T-T group, there were variable increases from baseline from Month 6 to Month 30 followed by a return to baseline at Month 42 and Month 54 and a decrease at Month 66. In the P-T group, there were variable increases from baseline at Month 24 (ie, after initiation of tafamidis at Month 18) to Month 66. Mean BMI was 25.2 kg/m2 for the non-Val30Met group. There were increases from baseline at Month 6 and Month 12 followed by variable decreases from Month 24 to Month 60. Modified Body Mass Index Mean mBMI at baseline was 1027.6 g/L × kg/m2 for the T-T Val30Met group and 1060.4 g/L × kg/m2 for the P-T Val30Met group. In the T-T group, increases from baseline were small and variable from Month 6 to Month 42 and at Month 66, and there was a small decrease from baseline at Month 54. In the P-T group, there were decreases from baseline to Month 18. After initiation of tafamidis at Month 18, there was a slight decrease from baseline at Month 24, and increases from baseline were observed from Month 30 to Month 66. Few non-Val30Met participants had available albumin data after Month 12 for mBMI assessment. Ambulatory Status By Year 6 after the first dose of treatment in Study B3461020, 3 participants in the T-T Val30Met group (estimated rate 8%) and 6 participants in the P-T Val30Met group (estimated rate 34.6%) progressed to the next ambulatory stage. By Year 5 after the first dose of tafamidis in Study B3461022, 4 participants in the non-Val30Met group (estimated rate 40%) progressed to the next ambulatory stage, and no additional participants progressed to the next ambulatory stage by Year 9.

Safety Results: Brief Summary and Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events A total of 692 all-causality TEAEs were reported during the study (Table S4), of which 40 were treatment-related TEAEs (Table S5). A total of 86 (92.5%) participants experienced at least 1 all-causality TEAE, and 25 (26.9%) participants experienced at least 1 all-causality treatment-emergent serious adverse event (SAE). However, a lower proportion of participants experienced treatment-related TEAEs (23 [24.7%] participants), and 1 (1.1%) participant experienced at least 1 treatment-related SAE. A total of 21 (22.6%) participants experienced at least 1 all-causality severe TEAE; the incidence of treatment-related severe TEAEs was low (2 [2.2%] participants). A total of 6 (6.5%) participants discontinued study drug due to all-causality TEAEs, of which 1 (1.1%) participant discontinued study drug due to treatment-related TEAE. A total of 8 (8.6%) participants required temporary discontinuation of study drug due to all-causality TEAEs, of which 2 (2.2%) participants temporarily discontinued study drug due to treatment-related TEAEs.

Treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as an event which began after enrollment in B3461023 (Fx1A-303) or which worsened during the course of B3461023 (Fx1A-303). MedDRA (v23.0) coding dictionary applied. The post-transplant data were not included. The most frequently reported all-causality TEAEs in participants by preferred term were Urinary tract infection (16 [17.2%]), Fall (13 [14.0%]), Influenza (11 [11.8%]), Thermal burn (12 [12.9%]), Oedema peripheral (9 [9.7%]), Upper respiratory tract infection (9 [9.7%]), Muscular weakness (9 [9.7%]), Pain in extremity (9 [9.7%]), and Headache (9 [9.7%]). Of note, the TEAE of Fall was reported in 12 (66.7%) non-Val30Met participants and 1 (2.6%) T-T Val30Met participant. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs in participants were Oedema peripheral (1 [2.6%] T-T Val30Met and 1 [5.6%] non-Val30Met group) and Urinary tract infection (1 [2.6%] T-T Val30Met and 1 [2.7%] P-T Val30Met group). All other treatment- related TEAEs occurred in 1 participant each. Two severe TEAEs were considered treatment-related:  One participant in the T-T Val30Met group experienced a severe TEAE of Pericardial effusion that was reported as recovered/resolved. Dose of study drug was not changed and the participant remained in the study.  One participant in the non-Val30Met group experienced a severe TEAE of Weight decreased that was reported as not recovered/resolved. Dose of study drug was not changed and the participant remained in the study. Permanent Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events A total of 6 (6.5%) participants discontinued study drug due to all-causality AEs, of which 1 (1.1%) participant in the T-T Val30Met group discontinued study drug due to treatment- related TEAE. The only TEAE considered treatment-related was Renal impairment, which was a SAE considered moderate in severity and recovered/resolved with sequelae. Deaths The 8 deaths during the study or within 28 days after the last dose of tafamidis were Cardiac failure (1 T-T Val30Met), Ileus (1 P-T Val30Met), Cardiac arrest (1 non-Val30Met), Sepsis (1 non-Val30Met), and Amyloidosis (2 non-Val30Met). In addition, 1 T-T Val30Met participant died from Lymphoma 10 days after last dose of tafamidis, and 1 non-Val30Met participant died after heart transplant 18 days after the last dose of tafamidis. There were 3 deaths reported outside the study reporting period. One T-T Val30Met participant died from Central nervous system lymphoma approximately 4.5 months after the last dose of tafamidis, 1 non-Val30Met participant Completed suicide approximately 1.5 years after the study reporting period, and 1 non-Val30Met participant died from an Unknown cause approximately 2 years after the study reporting period. Relatedness to treatment (tafamidis) for the 2 deaths of Completed suicide and Unknown was not provided by investigators. The other 9 deaths were considered not treatment-related. The estimated mortality rate using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 5 years from first dose in the parent study (B3461020) was 2.6% in the T-T Val30Met group and 2.7% in the P-T Val30Met group. Interpretation after Year 6 was impeded due to the decreased number of T-T and P-T participants in the study. The estimated mortality rate using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 5 years from first dose in the parent study (B3461022) was 25.1% and remained unchanged by Year 9 in the non-Val30Met group. Other Serious Adverse Events Of the 25 participants who experienced SAEs, 1 participant in the T-T Val30Met group experienced SAEs considered treatment-related. The participant had SAEs of Pericardial effusion, Cardiac failure, Condition aggravated, and Renal impairment. Pericardial effusion resolved, and Cardiac failure, Condition aggravated, and Renal impairment resolved with sequelae. The SAEs of Cardiac failure, Condition aggravated, and Renal impairment led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. Concomitant Medications The indications for use of concomitant drugs and the incidence of their use were not unexpected for the symptoms and AEs reported in this population. Clinical Laboratory Tests, Vital Signs, ECGs and Physical Examination There were no unexpected findings for clinical laboratory results, vital signs, ECGs, or physical examinations. Conclusion(s):  The long-term safety results of this study are consistent with the known safety profile of tafamidis. No new safety concerns were identified.  Worsening of impairment in the lower limbs, as measured by NIS-LL Total Score, was delayed to Month 66 in T-T Val30Met participants compared to P-T Val30Met participants, demonstrating the benefits of early intervention with tafamidis.  Health-related quality of life, as measured by Norfolk TQOL score, showed little change from baseline to Month 30, followed by worsening to Month 66 in T-T participants. Health-related quality of life worsened from baseline to Month 18 in P-T participants, followed by an improvement to a level similar to T-T participants from Month 42 to Month 66 after initiation of tafamidis at Month 18.  Functional status, as measured by the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale, slightly improved by Month 66 compared to Month 30 in T-T participants, and slightly worsened by Month 66 compared to Month 30 in P-T participants.  Impairment in the lower limbs (as measured by NIS-LL Total Score), health-related quality of life (as measured by Norfolk TQOL score), and functional status (as measured by Karnofsky Performance Status Scale) generally worsened over time in non-Val30Met participants with increasing variability as the number of participants declined at later time points. Also, the absence of a control group hampered the ability to draw meaningful conclusions for efficacy.  Rate of progression to the next ambulatory stage was delayed in T-T Val30Met participants at Year 6 compared to P-T Val30Met participants.  Rate of progression to the next ambulatory stage was more rapid in non-Val30Met participants at Year 5 compared to Val30Met participants and remained unchanged by Year 9.  Over time, participants gained access to tafamidis via prescription or discontinued from the study. As the number of study participants decreased, after Month 66 in the Val30Met group, interpretation of efficacy results was impeded due to increased variability.  Overall, these results demonstrated that long-term treatment with an oral daily dose of 20 mg tafamidis was well tolerated in participants with Val30Met and non-Val30Met ATTR amyloidosis, with no new safety concerns identified.
