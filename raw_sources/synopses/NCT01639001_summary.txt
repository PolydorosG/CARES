PROPRIETARY DRUG NAME®/GENERIC DRUG NAME: Xalkori®/Crizotinib PROTOCOL NO.: A8081029 PROTOCOL TITLE: Phase 3, Randomized, Open-Label Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Crizotinib versus Pemetrexed/Cisplatin or Pemetrexed/Carboplatin in Previously Untreated East Asian Patients With Non-Squamous Carcinoma of the Lung Harboring a Translocation or Inversion Event Involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Gene Locus Study Centers: This is a multicenter study conducted at 35 centers in 5 countries (China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand); 6 centers were initiated and subjects were screened but not randomized. Hence, these centers were terminated early. Study Initiation Date and Primary Completion or Final Completion Dates: Study Initiation Date: 29 September 2012 (First Subject First Visit); Primary Completion Date: 30 June 2015. This study is ongoing. Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Primary Objective:  To demonstrate that crizotinib (Arm A) is superior to first-line chemotherapy, pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin (Arm B), in prolonging progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor a translocation or inversion event involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene locus. Secondary Objectives:  To compare secondary measures of clinical efficacy including objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks, time to progression, intracranial and extracranial times to progression (time to overall progression [TTP], time to intracranial progression [IC-TTP] and time to extracranial progression [EC-TTP]) between the 2 treatment arms and evaluate survival probabilities at 1 year and 18 months, duration of response (DR) and time to tumor response (TTR) between the 2 treatment groups;  To assess the safety and tolerability of crizotinib compared to chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin); disease/treatment-related symptoms of lung cancer, and general health status in both treatment arms;  To evaluate screening methodologies for identification of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. METHODS Study Design: This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3, efficacy and safety study of crizotinib versus (vs) first-line chemotherapy, ie, pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin in previously untreated East Asian patients with ALK-positive, advanced non-squamous NSCLC. The Vysis ALK Break Apart fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) test developed by Abbott Molecular Inc. was used to determine ALK positivity. A total of 200 subjects were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive crizotinib (Arm A) or chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin; Arm B). The choice of the platinum-doublet chemotherapy in the chemotherapy arm was made by the investigators. Among these 200 subjects, approximately 180 subjects were to come from China. The additional subjects were to come from other Asian countries. The sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint of PFS. Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) (0-1, 2). Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Subjects were to continue with the assigned study treatment until Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; Version 1.1)-defined progressive disease (PD) as determined by independent radiology review (IRR), unacceptable toxicity, death, or consent withdrawal. Subjects could continue chemotherapy (for a maximum of 6 cycles) or crizotinib treatment as assigned beyond the time of RECIST-defined PD, as determined by IRR, at the discretion of the investigator if the subject was perceived to be experiencing clinical benefit. In the chemotherapy arm, subjects could be dosed for up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. If a subject completed the 6 cycles of chemotherapy and/or discontinued prior to RECIST-defined PD, he/she was to remain in the study with no additional treatment (ie, maintenance therapy was not permitted) and with ongoing tumor assessments until RECIST-defined PD, as determined by IRR, or initiation of additional anti-cancer therapy. In addition, once subjects in the chemotherapy arm had RECIST-defined PD, as determined by IRR, they were allowed to cross over to the crizotinib treatment arm providing they met the safety screening inclusion/exclusion criteria for crizotinib (eg, laboratory parameters and electrocardiogram [ECG] readings).

Acceptable time windows for performing each assessment are described in the column headings. All cycles were 21 days in duration. Once the primary endpoint (progression free survival) for the study has been summarized and reported in this clinical study report, ongoing subjects in Arm A or those subjects who crossed over from chemotherapy to receive crizotinib treatment will only need to visit the study site every other cycle for study assessments instead of every cycle. Enough study treatment for 2 cycles of treatment will be dispensed at each site visit. During the non-visit cycle, subjects are to telephone the study site to provide an update of AEs and concomitant medications. b. Cycle 1/Day 1: Blood chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, and physical examination were not required if an acceptable screening assessment was performed within 7 days prior to the start of study treatment. c. End of Treatment/Withdrawal: The end of treatment visit was to be performed as soon as possible but no later than 4 weeks (1 week) from last dose of study medication or when the decision was taken to withdraw from the study (whichever was sooner). d. Informed Consent: Had to be obtained prior to undergoing any study-specific procedure. e. Medical/Oncological History: Included information on prior regimens. f. Mandatory Tumor Tissue for Molecular Profiling: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block(s) should have been provided that were to be of adequate size to allow for the generation of 10 slides (minimum 7 slides) with each containing tissue sections that were 5-microns thick. These samples were to be used for the assessment of ALK gene fusion by FISH by the central laboratory. Tumor samples were to be sent to the central laboratory for FISH testing. These samples were also to be tested for ALK gene fusion by IHC assay to investigate concordance. Additional methods (eg, RT-PCR) may also have been used in subjects who had adequate and appropriate tissue samples g. Physical Examination: Included an examination of major body systems, height (at screening only), body weight, BP and pulse rate (at baseline and on Day 1 of each cycle). h. Ophthalmologic Examination: Included visual acuity and biomicroscopy slit lamp examination (including fundoscopy) and was to be performed by an ophthalmologist. Repeat ophthalmologic examination on Day 1 (2) of Cycle 2 and at the end of treatment/withdrawal or when clinically indicated and in case of worsening of existing AEs. i. Hematology, Blood Chemistry, Coagulation, and Urinalysis: Required tests are listed in the protocol. For subjects on crizotinib treatment: If ALT or AST Grade 3 or ALT or AST Grade 2 and total bilirubin Grade 2, obtained repeat ALT or AST and total bilirubin within 48 hours and then repeated every 48-72 hours until ALT/AST Grade 1. Crizotinib therapy should have been withheld during this time and re-started based upon guidance of Crizotinib Dose Modifications for Treatment Related Toxicity. A 4-mL serum sample obtained just prior to the first dose of study treatment was to be stored frozen on-site through completion of the study for possible use as a baseline reference should additional laboratory tests be indicated. A dipstick urine protein was measured at screening. If suspected proteinuria based on positive dipstick result, urine microscopic analysis was required. Additional tests and monitoring were to be performed as clinically indicated or under evidence of kidney radiographic changes during routine tumor assessments. j. Twelve (12)-lead ECG: All subjects were required to have a single ECG measurement at screening. For crizotinib arm subjects and crossover subjects from chemotherapy arm, triplicate ECG assessments were to be performed at respective timepoints. On Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3, ECGs were to be obtained at Hour 0 (pre-dose) and 2-6 hours following morning crizotinib dosing. For Arm B subjects, triplicate ECGs were to be obtained at Hour 0 (prior the start of dosing) on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2 and 3. For all subjects, QTc was required to be machine-read. If the QTc was prolonged (>500 msec), then the ECG was to be read by a cardiologist at the site for confirmation (to look for spurious QT effect). Additional ECGs were to be performed as clinically indicated. . Table 1. Schedule of Activities k. Pregnancy Test: Prior to IRB/EC approval of Protocol Amendment 4, all female subjects of child-bearing potential were required to have a negative pregnancy test at screening. The test was to be repeated whenever 1 menstrual cycle was missed during treatment or a potential pregnancy was otherwise suspected. Pregnancy tests could also be repeated at the request of IRBs/ECs or if required by local regulations. After IRBs/ECs approval of Protocol Amendment 4, for female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, was to be performed on 2 occasions prior to starting study therapy-once at the start of screening and once at the baseline visit, immediately before investigational product administration. Following a negative pregnancy result at screening, appropriate contraception had to be commenced and another negative pregnancy result was then to be required at Cycle 1 Day 1 before the subject could receive the investigational product. Pregnancy tests were also to be routinely repeated at every treatment cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study therapy, and additionally whenever 1 menstrual cycle was missed or when potential pregnancy was otherwise suspected. In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject was to be withdrawn from study medication but could remain in the study. Additional pregnancy tests could also be undertaken if requested by IRBs/ECs or if required by local regulations. l. Tumor Assessments: CT or MRI was to include chest, abdomen and pelvis (CAP) at all timepoints. Abdominal scans should have included complete visualization of both kidneys. Bone scintigraphy/bone scans and brain scans/head CT/MRI were also required at screening. All subsequent scans were based on a calendar schedule beginning from the date of randomization. The first post-randomization scan was to be performed at 6 weeks (+1 week), all subsequent scans were to be performed every 6 weeks (1 week) except for crossover subjects or for crizotinib past progression subjects, the subsequent scans should have been performed every 12 weeks (1 week). The brain was to be included in subsequent tumor assessments if a subject had brain metastases at baseline; otherwise, the brain was only to be evaluated when clinically indicated. Repeat bone scans were required every 12 weeks only if bone metastases were present at baseline; otherwise, a repeat bone scan was required only if new bone metastases were suspected. If bone metastasis was identified outside of the CAP region by the central independent radiology during screening phase, CT/MRI scans of the extremities were to be required every 6 weeks (1 week) in addition to the bone scans every 12 weeks (1 week). A bone scan was also required at the time of determination of response for subjects who had bone metastases. CT or MRI scan was also to be performed whenever PD was suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration). All scans prior to independent review determined disease progression or prior to crossover were to be sent to an independent radiology laboratory for a blinded RECIST review. Crossover subjects were to continue to perform tumor assessments; however, central IRR was no longer required. m. Contraceptive Check: After IRBs/ECs approval of Protocol Amendment 4, those who, in the opinion of the investigator, were sexually active and at risk for pregnancy had to agree to use 2 methods of highly effective contraception throughout the study and continue to do so for 90 days after the last dose of crizotinib and for 180 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the subject, was to select 2 appropriate methods of contraception for the individual subject and his/her partner from the list of permitted contraception methods and instruct the subjects in their consistent and correct use. Subjects were required to affirm that they met the criteria for correct use of 2 of the selected contraception methods. The investigator or his or her designee was to discuss with the subject the need to use 2 highly effective contraception methods consistently and correctly according to the Schedule of Activities and document such conversation in the subject’s chart. In addition, the investigator or his or her designee was to instruct the subject to call immediately if one or both selected contraception method were discontinued, or if pregnancy was known or suspected in the subject or the subject’s partner. n. AEs: Subject’s SAEs had to be reported from the time they signed the informed consent, ie, prior to undergoing any study related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product. AEs (serious and non-serious) should have been recorded on the CRF from the time the subject had taken at least 1 dose of study treatment through last subject visit. AEs were to be graded using CTCAE Version 4.0. o. Concomitant Medications/Treatments: Concomitant medications and treatments were to be recorded from 28 days prior to the start of study treatment and up to 28 days post the last dose of study treatment. Table 1. Schedule of Activities p. EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13: Subjects were to complete all EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 self-assessment questionnaires at the study site at the specified timepoints with the exception of the Day 7 assessment. The Day 7 assessment could be completed at home and was to be given to subjects along with completion guidelines/on site training at the Cycle 1/Day 1 visit (baseline). At Cycle 1/Day 1, site staff (eg, site coordinators) were to instruct subjects that the Day 7 assessment was to be completed without help from friends or family members and also recommend that this assessment be completed in the morning. On Day 7 (or the day prior), a member of the site staff was to call to remind subjects to complete the assessment that day and to return completed questionnaires at their next visit (Day 15). All other scheduled assessments of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 could not be taken home and were to be completed in the site prior to any other study or medical procedures. Questionnaires were also to be completed by crossover subjects at the same specified timepoints. q. VSAQ-ALK and EQ-5D: Subjects were to complete the VSAQ-ALK and the EQ-5D questionnaires at the study site prior to any study or medical procedure. All self-assessment questionnaires were to be completed by the subjects while at the site and could not be taken home. Translation of the VSAQ-ALK into different languages was undertaken and many language versions were available. However, if the VSAQ-ALK was not available in the subject’s preferred language the subject did not need to complete this assessment. Questionnaires were also to be completed by crossover subjects at the same specified timepoints. r. MUGA Scan or Echocardiogram: MUGA scans or echocardiograms were to be obtained from all subjects until sufficient data were available to discontinue collecting from newly enrolled subjects. The rationale for discontinuing this procedure was to be provided to the investigators. s. Survival Follow-Up: After discontinuation of study treatment, post-study survival status was to be collected every 2 months until death or until 36 months after the randomization of the last subject. This included collection of information on subsequent anticancer therapies. Telephone contact was acceptable. t. Optional Exploratory Biomarker Assessments (China Only, Optional): For Chinese subjects who agreed to participate in this part of assessment, 2 plasma samples were to be collected, 1 at baseline (Cycle 1/Day 1) prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment, and the second sample collected at the end of treatment if a subject withdrew from the study due to disease progression. A second sample was also to be collected from those subjects enrolled in China who crossed-over to the crizotinib treatment arm. This sample was to be collected prior to treatment with crizotinib. A third plasma sample was to be collected from crossover subjects at the end of treatment if the subject withdrew from the study due to disease progression. All biomarker assessments samples were to be stored frozen and remain frozen during shipment. u. Optional Pharmacogenomics Assessments (China Only, Optional): For Chinese subjects who agreed to participate in this part of assessment, a 4-mL blood sample was to be collected at baseline (Cycle 1/Day 1) for subjects enrolled in China prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment for possible analysis of DNA sequence variation in genes that could be associated with differences in the frequency, severity or nature of AEs or toxicities among subjects. This sample could also be collected during screening. All pharmacogenomic assessments blood samples had to be stored frozen and remain frozen during shipment. v. Thyroid Function Tests: Required tests were to be performed for all subjects enrolled after Protocol Amendment 3 approval (in both study arms). Blood draws had to be done between 06:00AM and 11:00AM. For all subjects, 2-mL blood serum sample was to be collected on Cycle 1/Day 1 before dosing for testing of Total T3, Total T4, Free T4, and TSH and subsequently, blood serum sample for TSH and Free T4 tests were to be collected Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 6, and at the end of the treatment as the last timepoint. For Arm A subjects and those who crossed-over from Arm B, blood serum sample for TSH and Free T4 tests were also to be collected Day 1 of every 3 cycles thereafter starting from Cycle 6/Day 1 till the end of treatment as the last timepoint (eg, Cycle 9/Day 1, Cycle 12/Day 1, et al). If subjects had abnormal TSH or Free T4, TSH and Free T4 tests should have been repeated at the next scheduled visit and additional tests such as Total T3 and Total T4 should have been performed at the same time to assist the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Once diagnosed, hypothyroidism should have been treated according to local standard practice to maintain euthyroid state. All samples were to be sent to and tested in the central laboratory. Thyroid function tests were not required for subjects who were enrolled in the study before Protocol Amendment 3, including those who were currently enrolled in Arm B and later crossed-over to Arm A after Protocol Amendment 3. Planned: 200 randomized subjects. Analyzed in randomized phase: A total of 207 subjects were randomized and included in the Full Analysis (FA) population (104 in the crizotinib arm and 103 in the chemotherapy arm). Of these, 205 treated subjects were included in the Safety Analysis (SA) population (104 in the crizotinib arm and 101 in the chemotherapy arm). Analyzed in crossover phase: A total of 83 subjects who were randomized to the chemotherapy arm received crizotinib after the randomization phase: 82 subjects through the crossover process and 1 subject as follow-up therapy (received crizotinib outside the study protocol as the subject did not meet the eligibility criteria to cross over and receive crizotinib treatment). The 82 subjects through the crossover process were analyzed. These 82 subjects were evaluated for efficacy and safety in the crossover phase. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Male or female subjects were to be 18 years to 70 years; have histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of locally advanced, not suitable for local treatment, recurrent, or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC; positive for translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene locus as determined by an ALK break-apart FISH test; have had no prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease (except prior adjuvant chemotherapy for Stage I-III or combined modality chemotherapy radiation for locally advanced disease if completed >12 months prior to randomization); and ECOG PS 0-2. Study Treatments:  Crizotinib, 250 mg twice daily (BID), was to be administered orally at approximately the same time each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Crizotinib could be administered without regard to meals.  Standard doses of chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin) were to be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion according to standard of care: o Pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) was to be administered by IV infusion over 10 minutes (min) or according to institutional administration timing on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. o Cisplatin (75 mg/m2) was to be administered by infusion after adequate hydration, according to institutional practices, beginning approximately 30 min after the end of the pemetrexed infusion. o Carboplatin (at a dose calculated to produce an area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] of 5 or 6 mg•min/mL) was to be administered by infusion, according to institutional practices, beginning approximately 30 min after the end of the pemetrexed infusion. Primary Endpoint:  PFS based on RECIST Version 1.1 (objective disease progression confirmed by IRR). Secondary Endpoints:  ORR, OS, DCR at 12 weeks, TTP, IC-TTP, EC-TTP, probabilities of survival at 1 year and 18 months, DR, and TTR (all per IRR except for OS and survival probabilities);  Type, incidence, severity, seriousness, and relationship to study medications of adverse events (AE) and any laboratory abnormalities;  Time to deterioration (TTD) in pain, dyspnea, or cough patient-reported disease symptoms;  HRQoL, disease/treatment-related symptoms and general health status. Safety Evaluations: Safety assessments included collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, ECOG PS, laboratory assessments (including pregnancy tests, ophthalmological examinations), multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scans or echocardiograms, thyroid function tests and concomitant treatments. Patient Reported Outcomes: PROs of HRQoL, functioning, lung cancer specific disease/treatment related symptoms, and general health status were assessed using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ C30), its corresponding quality of life questionnaire supplement module for lung cancer LC13 (QLQ LC13), and the EuroQol 5D (EQ 5D) questionnaire. Visual disturbances were assessed using the visual symptom assessment questionnaire ALK (VSAQ ALK). PRO assessments were performed at baseline, during treatment and at the end of treatment (EOT) visit. Statistical Methods: The following population sets were used: Full Analysis (FA) Population The FA population included all subjects who were randomized with study treatment assignment designated according to the initial randomization. The FA population was the primary population for evaluating efficacy endpoints (except as otherwise specified), subject characteristics and disposition. Throughout this Public Disclosure Synopsis (PDS), subject study treatment assignments in the FA population are referred to as treatment arms (ie, crizotinib arm or chemotherapy arm) with the exception of data presentations related to individual chemotherapy regimens (ie, pemetrexed/carboplatin or pemetrexed/cisplatin) that are referred to as treatments. The SA population included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment, with treatment assignments designated according to actual study treatment received during the first cycle. The SA population was the primary population for safety and treatment evaluations; in addition, this population was used when summarizing efficacy data by treatment (ie, by crizotinib, pemetrexed/carboplatin or pemetrexed/cisplatin). Throughout this PDS, data displays in the SA population by study treatment (crizotinib, chemotherapy) are denoted as “by group”. Data displays in the SA population by treatment with crizotinib or the by individual chemotherapy regimen (ie, pemetrexed/carboplatin or pemetrexed/cisplatin) are denoted as “by treatment”. Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Evaluable Population The PRO evaluable population was defined as subjects from the SA population who completed a baseline (last PRO assessment prior to first date of study medication) and at least 1 postbaseline PRO assessment (prior to crossover for subjects randomized to chemotherapy who subsequently crossed over). The PRO evaluable population was instrument specific and was the primary population for the analyses of change from baseline scores and TTD in patient-reported pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough (composite and individual items). Molecular Profiling (MP) Evaluable Population (Pharmacodynamic Evaluations) The MP evaluable population was defined as all subjects who were screened and who had a result of an IHC assay or other method such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for determining ALK-status, in addition to the FISH assay ALK result. A data cutoff date (30 June 2015) was identified for this final analysis as the time by which all events required for the final analysis (160 PFS events of PD determined by IRR, or death, as required per the sample size calculation) would be documented. The following analysis subgroups were defined: 1. Subjects randomized to crizotinib; 2. Subjects randomized to chemotherapy. Of note, for those subjects who crossed over from chemotherapy to receive crizotinib, all data up to and including the day prior to the first dose of crizotinib treatment were included, with the exception of OS that was calculated from the day of randomization to death independently from when it occurred. For subjects who did not cross over to receive crizotinib, all available data were to be included in this subgroup; 3. Subjects randomized to chemotherapy who crossed over to receive crizotinib beginning from the first day of crizotinib treatment (crossover subjects). Baseline for this subgroup included data after last dose of chemotherapy and prior to the first dose of crizotinib. stratified analysis) presented below were performed using the randomization stratification factor (ECOG PS [0-1 vs 2]) and 2 additional factors as follows:  Brain metastases (present, absent), from the screening non-target and/or target lesion CRF page;  Ethnicity (Han Chinese, other ethnicity) based on the Demography CRF page. Hereafter, the above three factors will be referred to as baseline stratification factors. Primary efficacy analysis: PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression (by IRR) or death on study due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS was analyzed in the FA population in subgroups 1 and 2. Differences in PFS between treatment arms were analyzed by the 1-sided log rank test stratified for baseline stratification factors. Estimates of the PFS curves obtained from the Kaplan-Meier method were presented and displayed graphically. The median PFS time (and other percentiles) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI were provided for each treatment arm. Additionally, for each treatment arm the median PFS and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI were provided for each level of the stratification variables. The Cox regression model, stratified for baseline stratification factors, was fitted for PFS times. The estimated hazard ratio (HR) (crizotinib arm/ chemotherapy arm) and 2-sided 95% CI were provided. Secondary efficacy analyses: ORR was defined as the percentage of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST Version 1.1, as determined by IRR. ORR was summarized for each treatment arm along with the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% CI using a method based on the F-distribution. ORR between the 2 treatment arms was compared using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified for baseline stratification factors and a 2-sided unstratified test (eg, Pearson). Treatment difference of ORR and its 95% CI based on the normal approximation were provided. Best overall response was summarized by treatment arm. Best overall response was also summarized for subjects in subgroup 3. DCR at 12 weeks was defined as the percentage of subjects with CR, PR, or stable disease at 12 weeks according to RECIST Version 1.1, as determined by IRR. DCR at Week 12 was analyzed similarly as described for ORR. An unstratified test (eg, Pearson) was used to compare DCR between the 2 treatment arms. DR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR), as determined by IRR, to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. DR was only calculated for the subgroup of subjects with objective response. DR was summarized for the subgroup of responders (CR and PR) using the Kaplan-Meier method. DR was also summarized for subjects in subgroup 3. response (CR or PR), as determined by IRR. TTR was only calculated for the subgroup of subjects with objective response. TTR was summarized in the subgroup of responders (CR and PR) using descriptive statistics. In addition, TTR was summarized for subjects in subgroup 3. TTP was defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression, as determined by IRR. Differences between treatment arms were analyzed by the unstratified log rank test. Estimates of the curves obtained from the Kaplan-Meier method were presented. IC-TTP was defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective intracranial disease progression, based on either new brain metastases or progression of existing brain metastases, as determined by IRR. EC-TTP was defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective extracranial disease progression, based on either new extracranial lesions or progression of existing extracranial lesions, as determined by IRR. TTP, IC-TTP and EC-TTP were analyzed for subgroups of subjects with and without brain metastases at baseline. OS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Differences in OS between treatment arms were analyzed by a 1-sided log-rank test stratified for baseline stratification factors. Estimates of the OS curves obtained from the Kaplan-Meier method were presented and displayed graphically. The probability of survival at 1 year was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and a 2-sided 95% CI for the log [-log(1-year survival probability)] was calculated using a normal approximation and then back-transformed to give a CI for the 1-year survival probability itself. The probability of survival at 18 months was estimated similarly. Patient-Reported Outcomes: Time to deterioration (TTD) in pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough symptoms from QLQ-LC13 was a composite endpoint, defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date the subject’s scale scores showed a 10-point or greater increase after baseline, in any of these 3 symptoms. TTD analyses for the composite endpoint and each of the 3 pre-specified symptoms were summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods. The estimated Kaplan-Meier plots were provided for the composite and each symptom within it, and the unstratified 2-sided log-rank test was the primary method to compare the time to first deterioration between the 2 treatment groups. The median time and 2-sided 95% CI for the median was also provided based on the Brookmeyer Crowley method. The Hochberg procedure was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Descriptive statistics by treatment were reported for the change from baseline for each of the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 multiple-item and single-item scale scores, and EQ-5D VAS and EQ-5D index scores. These included: the mean change (and 95% CI), median change (and range), and number of subjects completing the scale for each treatment group at each assessment time after baseline; the comparison of treatment differences in change from baseline, conducted using a 2-sample t-test for each of the first 6 cycles separately (6 was the maximum number of cycles allowed for the chemotherapy treatment); and, the comparison of within treatment differences (ie, the change from baseline scores) conducted using a paired t-test with all the data available for each treatment group. Repeated measures mixed-effects modeling were carried out for the EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-LC13 multiple-item and were reported for each item of the VSAQ-ALK. Molecular Profiling Analysis: The MP evaluable population was defined as all subjects who were screened and who had a result of an IHC assay or other method such as RT-PCR) for determining ALK-status, in addition to the FISH assay ALK result. For all subjects who had been screened for this study, a cross-tabulation were provided of the FISH and IHC test results, including the number of subjects who had the following FISH results: positive, negative, uninformative or assay not performed, and subjects who had the following IHC results: positive, negative, or “valid IHC status not available”. The percentage of cells that were positive by central laboratory ALK FISH testing were summarized using descriptive statistics and by best overall response (BOR) categories by treatment arm. For subjects with an ALK IHC test result, the H-Score were summarized using descriptive statistics by IHC test result categories (positive or negative) in MP evaluable population and by BOR categories by treatment arm. An H Score value represented the sum of the percentage of cells stained at each intensity multiplied by the staining intensity value. In order to assess the agreement between the FISH and IHC results, among subjects with positive or negative results on either test, test result categories (positive or negative) for FISH and IHC testing were cross tabulated. In addition, positive and negative agreement rates were determined with 95% CIs. Safety: Safety data were analyzed in the SA population. All AEs were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 18.1. Severity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0. AEs were also summarized by relatedness to study treatment. Safety data (AEs, laboratory test parameters, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, ECOG PS, MUGA scans or echocardiograms, ophthalmologic examinations, and thyroid function tests) were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition data is summarized in Table 2. Of the 207 subjects in the FA population, 104 subjects were randomized to the crizotinib arm, and 103 subjects were randomized to the chemotherapy arm. A total of 39 (37.5%) subjects in the crizotinib arm and 41 (39.8%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm (including the crossover phase) were discontinued from the study. The most common reason for discontinuation from the study in both treatment arms was subject death (35 [33.7%] subjects in the crizotinib arm and 35 [34.0%] subjects in the chemotherapy arm).

Efficacy Results: Primary endpoint: The required number of PFS events for the final analysis was achieved and a data cutoff date of 30 June 2015 was used. The study met its primary objective of demonstrating that crizotinib significantly prolonged PFS compared to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, as assessed by IRR. The HR comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy was 0.402 (95% CI: 0.286, 0.565), with a p-value 103 subjects randomized to chemotherapy (Table 4). Table 4.

Overall Survival and Probabilities of Survival at 1 Year and 18 Months At the time of the PFS analysis, a total of 35 (33.7%) subjects in the crizotinib arm and 37 (35.9%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm were known to have died (Table 5). The median duration of follow-up for OS was approximately 22.5 months and 21.6 months in the crizotinib arm and chemotherapy arm, respectively. With only 33.7% of OS events and 83 subjects (80.6%) randomized to the chemotherapy arm receiving subsequent crizotinib treatment, there was a numerical improvement in OS in the crizotinib arm compared with chemotherapy arm (HR: 0.897; 95% CI: 0.556, 1.445; 1-sided p value=0.3274). The median OS estimate was 28.5 months in the crizotinib arm and 27.7 months in the chemotherapy arm. Probabilities of survival at 1 year and 18 months were similar between the treatment arms; 79% and 71% for crizotinib, respectively, and 80% and 73%, for chemotherapy, respectively. These OS analyses were not adjusted for the potentially confounding effects of crossover, as 83 subjects in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent crizotinib treatment.

Disease Control Rate At Week 12, crizotinib had a greater DCR compared to chemotherapy: 83% (95% CI: 74, 89) for crizotinib and 74% (95% CI: 64, 82) for chemotherapy, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p-value=0.1204 [2-sided Pearson chi-square test]). Time to Progression The HR comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy for TTP was 0.348 (95% CI: 0.246, 0.493), with a p-value <0.0001 (1-sided, based on unstratified log-rank test). The median TTP was 12.0 months (95% CI: 8.4, 15.4) in the crizotinib arm and 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.7, 7.1) in the chemotherapy. A total of 23.1% and 15.5% of subjects in the crizotinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively, showed progression of preexisting brain lesions or developed new brain lesions. There was a numerical improvement in IC-TTP in the crizotinib arm (HR: 0.669; 95% CI: 0.335, 1.338; p-value=0.1270, 1-sided, based on unstratified log-rank test). The median IC-TTP was not reached in the crizotinib arm and was 16.0 months (95% CI: 12.6, NR) in the chemotherapy arm. Time to Extracranial Progression The HR comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy for EC-TTP was 0.277 (95% CI: 0.186, 0.412), with a p-value <0.0001 (1-sided, based on unstratified log-rank test). The median EC-TTP was 18.0 months (95% CI: 12.3, 20.9) in the crizotinib arm and 7.0 months (95% CI: 6.0, 7.1) in the chemotherapy arm. Patient-Reported Outcomes Results: Summaries of TTD are provided in Table 9 (composite of pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough). Treatment with crizotinib was associated with a statistically significantly longer TTD in the symptoms of pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough compared to chemotherapy (HR: 0.432 with 95% CI: 0.307, 0.610; Hochberg adjusted log-rank 2-sided p-value <0.0001). The median TTD in pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough as a composite endpoint was 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.4, 6.9) for crizotinib-treated subjects and 0.3 months (95% CI: 0.3, 0.5) for chemotherapy-treated subjects.

Overall, a statistically significantly greater improvement from baseline was observed for crizotinib-treated subjects compared with chemotherapy-treated subjects in global quality of life (p-value <0.0001), physical functioning (p-value <0.0001), role functioning (p-value <0.05), social functioning (p-value <0.05), appetite loss (p-value <0.05), fatigue (p-value <0.05), insomnia (p-value <0.05), pain (p-value <0.0001), pain in arm or shoulder (p-value <0.05), pain in other parts (p-value <0.05), alopecia (p-value <0.05), and lung cancer symptoms including coughing (p-value <0.05), dyspnea (p-value <0.0001), and pain in chest (p-value <0.05). A statistically significantly greater deterioration in the crizotinib group compared with chemotherapy group was observed for diarrhea (p-value <0.0001) and constipation (p-value <0.05). No statistically significant differences in overall change from baseline were observed between the 2 groups for nausea/vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, hemoptysis, or dysphagia. A statistically significantly (p-value <0.05) greater improvement from baseline in general health status (as assessed by the EQ-5D) was observed for crizotinib-treated subjects compared with chemotherapy-treated subjects. Molecular Profiling Results: ALK status for enrollment was prospectively determined by Central Laboratory analysis of Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) NSCLC tissue using an Investigational-Use Only (IUO) ALK Break Apart FISH test (Abbott Molecular). Sections from the same tissue sample were retrospectively tested in batches by the Central Laboratory using an anti-ALK (positive or negative) from both the Abbott Molecular FISH test and the Ventana IHC test. The mean and median percentages of cells positive for ALK gene rearrangement by FISH were similar between the 2 treatment arms, as was the mean and median H-score for ALK protein expression by IHC. Based on analysis of subjects in the MP evaluable population (N=812), positive ALK status was identified in 238 (29.3%) and 249 (30.7%) subjects by FISH and IHC, respectively. Among subjects in the MP evaluable population who had an ALK IHC result and either a positive or a negative ALK FISH result (N=771), the positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA) and overall percent agreement (OPA) were consistently high (87.6% to 96.2%), regardless of which test was used as reference. Using FISH as a reference test, the PPA and NPA were 91.6% (95% CI: 87.4, 94.5) and 94.2% (95% CI: 91.9, 95.9), respectively. There was high concordance in the assessment of ALK status between the Ventana anti-ALK (D5F3) IHC and the Abbott Molecular ALK Break Apart FISH tests (kappa=0.85; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.89). Safety Results: This section presents treatment-emergent adverse events (all-causality AEs and treatment-related AEs). AE data summaries included AE data captured in the CRF until the end of study or the start of new systemic anticancer therapy for those patients who received new systemic anticancer therapy. The duration of study treatment was longer in the crizotinib group (median 67.8 weeks) than in the chemotherapy group (median 18.4 weeks). The AE analyses presented below were not adjusted for the longer duration of study treatment for the crizotinib group compared with the chemotherapy group. Adverse events (AEs) The treatment-emergent non-serious AEs reported in 5% of subjects in any of the treatment group by preferred term and by system organ class (all causality and treatment-related) are summarized in Table 10. Overall, 102 (98.08%) subjects in the crizotinib group and 100 (99.01%) subjects in the chemotherapy group experienced all causality treatment-emergent, non-serious AEs. Meaningfully different incidences of all-causality non-serious AEs were considered to be those that were reported with an incidence of ≥10% of subjects in either treatment group and had a ≥5% absolute difference between treatment groups. All causality non-serious AEs of diarrhoea, visual impairment, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, oedema peripheral, headache, pain in extremity, dizziness, nasopharyngitis, sinus bradycardia, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, and vision blurred were reported with a meaningfully higher frequency in the crizotinib group than in the chemotherapy group. All causality non-serious AEs of anaemia, neutropenia, platelet count decreased, haemoglobin decreased, white blood cell count decreased and hyponatraemia were reported with a meaningfully higher frequency in the chemotherapy group than in the crizotinib group. Overall, 100 (96.15%) subjects in the crizotinib group and 96 (95.05%) subjects in the chemotherapy group experienced treatment-emergent, treatment-related, non-serious AEs. impairment in the crizotinib group, and anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, sinus bradycardia, photopsia, vision blurred, and visual impairment in the chemotherapy group. Anaemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, sinus bradycardia and photopsia were reported in ≥30% of subjects in both the crizotinib and chemotherapy groups.

AEs Associated with Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment Because the frequency of certain medical concepts or conditions may have been underestimated by reliance on single MedDRA preferred terms, certain preferred terms were analyzed in aggregate using clustered terms. Subjects having more than 1 AE preferred term within a clustered term contributed 1 event to the clustered term at the highest grade observed. AEs associated with permanent discontinuation of study treatment regardless of causality by preferred term and clustered term (capital letters) are summarized in Table 12. The percentages of subjects with all-causality AEs associated with permanent discontinuation from study treatment were reported for 19 (18.3%) crizotinib-treated subjects and 4 (4.0%) chemotherapy-treated subjects.

Included in the total are 2 crizotinib-treated subjects and 1 chemotherapy-treated subject, whose deaths occurred >28 days after the last dose of study treatment, but were considered Grade 5 events by the investigator. The most commonly reported Grade 5 all-causality AE for crizotinib-treated subjects was Disease progression (11 [10.6%] subjects). There was no Grade 5 all-causality AE reported in more than 1 chemotherapy-treated subject. There were 2 treatment-related Grade 5 AEs (Death and Interstitial lung disease) for crizotinib-treated subjects.

Both Grade 5 AEs led to subject’s death. Clinical laboratory and other safety evaluations In crizotinib-treated subjects, the most common shifts (≥5% of subjects) from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline of hematology data were for absolute neutrophils (17.3%) and lymphopenia (5.8%). In chemotherapy-treated subjects, the most common shifts (≥5% of subjects) from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline were for absolute neutrophils (26.7%), anemia (12.9%), white blood cells (9.9%), platelets (8.9%) and lymphopenia (7.9%). In crizotinib-treated subjects, the most common shifts (≥5% of subjects) from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline of chemistry data were for hypophosphatemia (13.5%), ALT (10.6%) and hypermagnesemia (10.6%). In chemotherapy-treated subjects, the most common shifts (≥5% of subjects) from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline was for hyponatremia (6.0%). Other safety parameters (blood pressure, ECGs, and MUGA scans/Echocardiograms, and ophthalmologic evaluations) did not reveal any new safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS:  Crizotinib treatment resulted in a statistically significant, robust, and clinically ALK-positive, advanced non-squamous NSCLC (HR: 0.402, 1-sided p-value <0.0001). Median PFS was 11.1 months and 6.8 months for the crizotinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively.  Crizotinib treatment resulted in a clinically and statistically significant improvement in IRR-assessed ORR compared with chemotherapy (88% vs 46%; 2-sided p-value <0.0001), with objective responses that were rapid in onset (median TTR 6.3 weeks) and durable (median DR 44.4 weeks).  Crizotinib treatment resulted in a clinically and statistically significant improvement in IRR-assessed TTP compared with chemotherapy (HR: 0.348, 1-sided p-value <0.0001). Median TTP was 12.0 months and 6.9 months for the crizotinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively. This improvement in TTP was also observed when only extracranial lesions were evaluated (HR: 0.277; 1-sided p-value <0.0001). There was a numerical improvement in IC-TTP in the crizotinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm (HR: 0.669; 1-sided p-value=0.1270).  With only 33.7% OS events, there was a numerical improvement in OS in the crizotinib arm compared with chemotherapy (HR: 0.897, 1-sided p-value=0.3274). Median OS estimates were 28.5 months and 27.7 months for the crizotinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively. These OS analyses were not adjusted for the potentially confounding effects of crossover, as 83 (80.6%) subjects in the chemotherapy arm received subsequent crizotinib treatment.  Crizotinib had a distinct side effect profile that was generally tolerable and manageable by dosing interruption, dose reduction, and/or standard medical therapy.  Crizotinib treatment significantly delayed TTD in the composite endpoint of lung cancer symptoms of pain in chest, cough, or dyspnea (HR: 0.432; 2-sided p-value<0.0001).  Crizotinib treatment resulted in statistically significantly (2-sided p-value<0.05) greater improvement from baseline in patient-reported key lung cancer symptoms, global quality of life, and general health status as compared with chemotherapy-treated subjects.  Assessment of ALK status was highly concordant between the Ventana anti-ALK (D5F3) IHC test and the reference Abbott Molecular ALK Break Apart FISH test (PPA, 91.6% [95% CI: 87.4, 94.5]; NPA, 94.2% [95% CI: 91.9, 95.9]).

Ethical Conduct of the Study This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all ICH GCP Guidelines. In addition, all local regulatory requirements were followed, in particular, those affording greater protection to the safety of trial patients. INTRODUCTION Study A8081029 (hereafter referred to as Study 1029) was an open-label, multi-center, randomized Phase 3, efficacy and safety study of crizotinib versus first-line chemotherapy, ie, pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin, in previously untreated East Asian patients with ALK-positive, non-squamous NSCLC. The required number of events for the primary endpoint (PFS) was reached (June 2015) and a final CSR was produced which included the final results from the following efficacy endpoint analyses: PFS, ORR, DCR at 12 weeks, TTP, IC-TTP, EC-TTP, DR and TTR, and interim results from OS. The final CSR was based on a data cutoff date of 30 June 2015. In addition to the efficacy endpoints described above, the final CSR summarized safety, PROs, and pharmacodynamics. A supplemental CSR was produced to report the final analysis for OS based on a data cutoff date of 20 January 2018. This supplemental CSR also provided an update of the VSAQ-ALK questionnaire and cumulative results of safety as of the date. This supplemental synopsis CSR presents cumulative results of safety and summarizes updated safety data as of the LPLV for this study since the previous supplemental CSR. LPLV occurred on 08 January 2020, with database release on 21 June 2020. The database release was delayed for pending SDV and queries, as visits to study sites and responses from several study sites were delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were no updated analyses performed for efficacy or PRO data. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS The study objectives and endpoints are presented in Table 1.

Refer to Section 9.1 of the previous supplemental CSR, and Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 3 for the study design. Selection of Study Population Previously untreated East Asian patients with locally advanced (not suitable for local treatment), recurrent or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell carcinoma of the lung harboring a translocation or inversion event involving the ALK gene locus were enrolled in this study. Key inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. For a full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, refer to Sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2 of the final CSR. Key inclusion criteria: 1. Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of locally advanced not suitable for local treatment, recurrent or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. 2. Positive for translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene locus (eg, resulting in EML4-ALK fusion) as determined by an ALK break apart FISH assay and defined by an increase in the proximity of 5’ and 3’ ALK probes or the loss of the 5’ probe. 3. No prior systemic treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease (exception below):  Prior adjuvant chemotherapy for Stage I-III or combined modality chemotherapy radiation for locally advanced disease allowed if completed >12 months prior to randomization. 4. Patients with brain metastases were eligible if appropriately treated and neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks and were not taking any medications contraindicated in exclusion criteria. 5. Female or male, 18-70 years of age. 6. ECOG PS 0-2. Key exclusion criteria: 1. Prior therapy specifically directed against ALK. 2. Carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease. 3. Spinal cord compression unless treated with the patient-attaining good pain control and stable or recovered neurologic function. 4. Any of the following within the 3 months prior to starting study treatment: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, or cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack. Appropriate treatment with anticoagulants was permitted. 5. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE Grade 2, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation of any grade, or QTc >470 msec. The concomitant use of medicinal products known to prolong QTc was not advised and these should be avoided. interstitial fibrosis or any grade of interstitial lung disease, including a history of any grade of the following conditions: pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, and pulmonary fibrosis, but not history of prior radiation pneumonitis. 7. Concurrent use of drugs that were CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices, associated with life-threatening arrhythmias, including but not limited to dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, pimozide, astemizole, cisapride, and terfenadine. These drugs must be avoided from the time of the first dose of crizotinib until treatment discontinuation. 8. Prior malignancy (other than current NSCLC): patients were not eligible if they had evidence of active malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer, or localized and presumed cured prostate cancer) within the last 3 years. 9. Other severe acute or chronic medical (including severe gastrointestinal conditions such as diarrhea or ulcer) or psychiatric conditions, or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator and/or Sponsor, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. Treatments Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either crizotinib or first-line chemotherapy (pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin). Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. For patients randomized to Arm B, the choice of cisplatin or carboplatin to be combined with pemetrexed was made by the investigator. Refer to Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 5.2 for details of study treatments.

Statistical Methods Planned in the Protocol and Determination of Sample Size Refer to Section 9.7 of the final CSR and the previous supplemental CSR. RESULTS Patient Disposition and Data Sets Analyzed A total of 207 patients were randomized into the study and were included in the FA population. Of these, 104 patients were randomized to the crizotinib arm, and 103 to the chemotherapy arm (Table 3). Two patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm were not treated; all other patients received the treatment to which they were randomized. Thus, the SA population included 205 patients. Data sets analyzed by treatment arm/group are presented in Table 12 of the previous supplemental CSR. ongoing in this study at the data cutoff date for the previous supplemental CSR (Table 6 in the previous supplemental CSR). At the data cutoff date for this supplemental synopsis CSR, no patients in the crizotinib arm or the chemotherapy arm were still on treatment and no patients were on study. Of the patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm, 84 patients crossed over to receive crizotinib (including 1 patient who crossed over after the data cutoff date for the previous supplemental CSR) through the crossover process defined in the protocol (ie, patients in the chemotherapy arm who had RECIST-defined progressive diseases, as determined by IRR, were allowed to cross over to receive crizotinib treatment, providing they met safety screening inclusion/exclusion criteria for crizotinib therapy) (Table 14.1.1.5 and Table 16.2.1.4). This supplemental synopsis CSR presents cumulative results of safety and summarizes updated safety data as of the LPLV for this study. Table 3.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Source Data: Table 16.2.1.1 Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 05JUL2020 Date of Table Generation: 06JUL2020 (02:37) A summary of patient disposition at the end of randomized treatment by treatment for the SA population is presented in Table 4. In the previous supplemental CSR, all chemotherapy-treated patients discontinued from chemotherapy, and 13 patients randomized to crizotinib treatment were on treatment (Table 8 in the previous supplemental CSR). At the time of this supplemental synopsis CSR, no patients were on treatment. For the 13 patients who were receiving crizotinib treatment at the data cutoff date for the previous supplemental CSR, 6 subsequently permanently discontinued crizotinib treatment due to Global deterioration of health status, and 7 permanently discontinued due to “Other” reasons as presented in Table 4. These latter 7 patients were transferred to an extension study (Study A8081067) (Table 16.2.1.2). For the 84 patients who crossed over to receive crizotinib treatment, the median time from randomization to the chemotherapy arm until the start of crizotinib treatment was 34.4 weeks (range: 7.4 to 231.4 weeks) (Table 14.1.1.5). The 1 patient who crossed over after the data cutoff date for the previous supplemental CSR stopped chemotherapy on , and started to receive crizotinib on (Table 16.2.5.1.1 and Table 16.2.5.1.1c). Patient disposition at End of Treatment for the 84 patients who crossed over from chemotherapy to receive crizotinib treatment is summarized in Table 5. Crizotinib treatment was permanently discontinued for all 84 patients. The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation after crossover was Objective progression or relapse (25 [29.8%] patients) and Global deterioration of health status (24 [28.6%] patients). For the 11 crossover patients who were on treatment at the data cutoff for the previous supplemental CSR (Table 9 in the previous supplemental CSR) and the 1 patient who crossed over to receive crizotinib treatment after the data cutoff date for the previous supplemental CSR, the reasons for permanent discontinuation from treatment were Objective progression or relapse for 3 patients, Global deterioration of health status for 2 patients, AE for 1 patient, and “Other” reasons for 6 patients. Five of the latter 6 patients were transferred to the extension study (Study A8081067) and the other 1 patient permanently discontinued due to mobility problems; the patient was unable to come to the hospital (Table 16.2.1.2c).

The median duration of crizotinib treatment based on active dosing days was 61.7 weeks. The median number of crizotinib cycles started for crossover patients was 21.0 (range: 1-92) cycles (Table 14.4.1.2.1c). Brief Summary of Adverse Events A summary of all-causality TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs by treatment group is provided in Table 10. After the data cutoff date for the previous supplemental CSR, the number of crizotinib-treated patients with all-causality SAEs and all-causality Grade 3 or 4 AEs increased by 1 (this additional patient had a Grade 4 SAE of Hyperuricaemia [Table 16.2.7.1 and Table 16.2.7.2]), and the number of crizotinib-treated patients with all-causality and treatment-related AEs associated with dose reduction decreased by 1. The decrease in the number of patients with AEs associated with dose reduction was due to a case of crizotinib-related Thrombocytopenia, which was reported to be associated with dose reduction in the previous supplemental CSR, but updated by the investigator as associated with temporary discontinuation for this supplemental synopsis CSR (Table 14.3.1.1.3.1).

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Source Data: Table 16.2.7.1c Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 22JUN2020 Date of Table Generation: 10JUL2020 (01:39) Incidence of Adverse Events This section presents TEAEs. Because the frequency of certain medical concepts or conditions may have been underestimated by reliance on single MedDRA preferred terms, certain preferred terms were analyzed in aggregate using cluster terms. Patients having more than 1 TEAE preferred term within a cluster term contributed 1 event to the cluster term at the highest grade observed. TEAEs were summarized by MedDRA preferred terms and by cluster terms. Cluster terms and MedDRA preferred terms within each cluster term are presented in the footnote of Table 14.3.1.2.9.4.1.1. Not all MedDRA preferred terms within each cluster term were actually reported in this study. Cluster terms are presented using in all the corresponding tables of this supplemental synopsis CSR. All-Causality and Treatment-Related Adverse Events A summary of all-causality and treatment-related AEs by MedDRA SOC, preferred term and maximum CTC Grade is provided in Table 14.3.1.2.9.1.1 and Table 14.3.1.3.9.1.1, respectively. Meaningfully different incidences of all-causality AEs were considered to be those that were reported with an incidence of ≥10% of patients for either treatment group and had a ≥5% absolute difference between treatment groups. A summary of those all-causality AEs meeting the criteria is provided in Table 12. All-causality AEs with a meaningfully higher frequency for crizotinib-treated patients than for chemotherapy-treated patients were similar to those reported in the previous supplemental CSR, except for Nausea, which was reported by 1 additional chemotherapy-treated patient after the cutoff date for the previous supplemental CSR, making the absolute difference <5% between the treatment groups (Table 14.3.1.2.9.4.1.1). All-causality AEs with a meaningfully higher frequency for chemotherapy-treated patients than for crizotinib-treated patients were identical to those reported in the previous supplemental CSR (see Table 28 in the previous supplemental CSR). A summary of all-causality AEs by maximum CTC grade group (Grade 1-2, Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) in decreasing order of frequency in crizotinib is provided in Table 14.3.1.2.9.4.1.1. The frequencies of most frequent (≥10% of patients for either treatment group) all-causality AEs were comparable to those in the previous supplemental CSR (see Table 29 in the previous supplemental CSR) with increases from 0 to 2 patients across both treatment groups, except for OEDEMA, which was reported by 4 additional crizotinib-treated patients. by Treatment Group With a >=5% Absolute Difference Between Treatment Groups (All Cycles) - Safety Analysis Population --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Crizotinib Chemotherapy (N=104) (N=101)(a) ------------------------- ------------------------- MedDRA Preferred Term or Clustered Term n (%) n (%) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES 73 (70.2) 48 (47.5) Diarrhoea 63 (60.6) 9 (8.9) VISION DISORDER 61 (58.7) 11 (10.9) Vomiting 61 (58.7) 46 (45.5) NEUTROPENIA 49 (47.1) 67 (66.3) LEUKOPENIA 47 (45.2) 70 (69.3) Constipation 37 (35.6) 27 (26.7) OEDEMA 37 (35.6) 8 (7.9) COUGH 36 (34.6) 27 (26.7) UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION 35 (33.7) 15 (14.9) Headache 29 (27.9) 9 (8.9) DIZZINESS 28 (26.9) 11 (10.9) Decreased appetite 27 (26.0) 33 (32.7) Blood albumin decreased 26 (25.0) 16 (15.8) ANAEMIA 23 (22.1) 67 (66.3) Pain in extremity 22 (21.2) 6 (5.9) ABDOMINAL PAIN 21 (20.2) 8 (7.9) Hypoalbuminaemia 19 (18.3) 8 (7.9) NEUROPATHY 19 (18.3) 6 (5.9) BRADYCARDIA 17 (16.3) 0 (0.0) Blood lactate dehydrogenase increased 15 (14.4) 1 (1.0) Disease progression 15 (14.4) 1 (1.0) Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 14 (13.5) 0 (0.0) Protein total decreased 14 (13.5) 3 (3.0) Hypocalcaemia 13 (12.5) 4 (4.0) Fatigue 9 (8.7) 17 (16.8) THROMBOCYTOPENIA 8 (7.7) 32 (31.7) Hyponatraemia 6 (5.8) 16 (15.8) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MedDRA version 23.0 coding dictionary applied.

After the data cutoff date for the previous supplemental CSR, 3 crizotinib-treated patients had SAEs; 1 each had Hyperuricaemia, Gastrointestinal viral infection, and Pancreatitis acute (Table 16.2.7.2 and Table 14.3.2.2.4.1). The number of crizotinib-treated patients and chemotherapy-treated patients with all-causality SAEs of Pneumonia increased by 1 each. These increases were due to the MedDRA version update (Lung infection in version 20.1 for the previous supplemental CSR versus Pneumonia in version 23.0 for this supplemental synopsis CSR). The most frequently reported (≥2 patients for either treatment group) all-causality SAEs were identical to those for both crizotinib-treated patients and chemotherapy-treated patients (Table 23).

The number of patients with shifts of clinical chemistry results from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline were identical to those reported in the previous supplemental CSR, except for hypophosphatemia and hyperglycemia (each reported by 1 additional patient), hypocalcemia (reported by 1 less patient; Grade 3 and 4 hypocalcemia were removed for this patient) and hypermagnesemia (net decrease of 1 patient; Grade 3 hypermagnesemia was removed for 2 patients, but a new Grade 3 hypermagnesemia was reported for 1 additional patient). These laboratory test results for 1 patient with hypocalcemia and 2 patients with hypermagnesemia were removed for the following reason: Two external laboratories that were used by 1 study site measured trace element magnesium and trace element calcium instead of serum magnesium and serum calcium, respectively. This study site was not aware of these errors and misclassified the laboratory test results for trace element magnesium and trace element calcium, which were within normal range for the trace elements, as Grade 3 hypermagnesemia for 2 patients, and Grade 3 and 4 hypocalcemia for 1 patient.
