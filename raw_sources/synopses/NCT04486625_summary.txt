On Day 1, participants received a 30-minute IV loading dose infusion (500/167 mg ATM/AVI for Cohort 1, 675/225 mg ATM/AVI for Cohort 2) at approximately 7:30 AM and 3-hour IV extended loading (1500/500 mg ATM/AVI for Cohort 1, 675/225 mg ATM/AVI for Cohort 2) at approximately 8:00 AM. This was followed by 3-hour IV maintenance infusions (1500/500 mg ATM/AVI for Cohort 1, 675/225 mg ATM/AVI for Cohort 2) dosed every 6 hours (q6h) for Cohort 1 or every 8 hours (q8h) for Cohort 2 on Days 1 to 3. Loading dose and extended loading dose were prepared in one infusion bag with an infusion rate change after the first 30 minutes. Efficacy Evaluations: Not Applicable Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Blood Samples Venous blood samples (2 mL) were collected in labeled tubes containing sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate at 0 (predose), 0.5, and 3.5 hours after start of the loading dose infusion on Day 1 and at 0 (predose), 2, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours after start of a maintenance dose infusion on Day 3. In Cohort 1 (normal renal function group), trough blood samples (2 mL) were collected in labeled tubes containing sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate within 10 min before the start of each maintenance dose infusion (started at 6.5 hours after the start of the loading dose, q6h) on Days 1-3. In Cohort 2 (severe renal function group), trough blood samples (2 mL) were collected in labeled tubes containing sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate within 10 min before the start of each maintenance dose infusion (started at 8.5 hours after the start of the loading dose, q8h) on Days 1-3. Urine Samples In Cohort 1 (normal renal function group), urine samples were collected in collection containers at predose on Day 3, and then during collection periods of 0-2, 2-4, and 4-6 hours after the start of a maintenance dose infusion. In Cohort 2 (severe renal impairment group), urine samples were collected in collection containers at predose on Day 3, and then during collection periods of 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, and 6-8 hours after the start of a maintenance dose infusion. ATM and AVI concentrations in plasma and urine were measured by a validated liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using electrospray ionization (ESI) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection mode method. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included physical examinations, BP and PR, temperature, and ECG, AEs and laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the natural log-transformed total daily area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to 24 hours at steady-state (AUC ) and C between the normal renal function group and the severe renal 24,ss max impairment group. The geometric least squares mean point estimate and the associated 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference of each comparison were estimated.

Attainment of steady-state was evaluated by a graphical presentation of pre-infusion concentration (trough) values on Days 1-3. A set of summary tables split by renal function group was produced to evaluate any potential risk associated with the safety and toleration of administering ATM-AVI. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 11 participants were enrolled and assigned to treatment, among which 6 participants were in the normal renal function group and 5 participants were in the severe renal impairment group (Table S4). All participants completed the study (Table S5). Demographic characteristics were comparable between groups of participants with normal renal function and severely impaired renal function. All participants were male, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 64.1 (6.58) years. The majority of the participants (9/11, 81.8%) were White.

On Day 3, following maintenance infusions of 1500 mg q6h and 675 mg of ATM q8h for the normal renal function group and the severe renal impairment group, respectively, ATM plasma exposures as measured by AUC and C were lower in participants with severe renal impairment compared to those 24,ss max in participants with normal renal function. C was observed approximately at the end of the max 3-hour infusion with a median T of 2.92 hours for both groups. A longer t was observed max ½ in participants with severe renal impairment, with a mean value of 4.902 hours compared to a mean value of 2.605 hours for the normal renal function group. The geometric mean CL values were 6.499 and 2.761 L/hr for normal renal function and severe renal impairment groups, respectively. The geometric mean V values were 23.70 and 18.46 L for the normal ss renal function and the severe renal impairment groups, respectively. Steady-state generally appeared to have been achieved on Day 1 based on similar median trough (predose) concentrations on Day 1 to Day 3. Urinary recovery of unchanged ATM was 69.68% and 53.51% of the dose for the normal renal function and the severe renal impairment groups, respectively. CL was 4.527 and 1.477 r L/hr for the normal renal function and the severe renal impairment groups, respectively.

Total daily ATM exposure (AUC ) and peak exposure (C ) were 24,ss max ~21% and ~24% lower in participants with severe renal impairment, compared to the normal renal function group. The ratios of the adjusted geometric means of ATM AUC24,ss (90% CIs) and C (90% CIs) were 79.48% (66.52%, 94.96%) and 75.58% (66.10%, max 86.43%), respectively, for participants with severe renal impairment, compared to the normal renal function group. Variability in ATM exposure based on CV% was 16% for area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) parameters and ranged from 11-13% for C . max  AVI Pharmacokinetics PK parameters are summarized descriptively in Table S8. On Day 3, following maintenance infusion of 500 mg q6h and 225 mg q8h of AVI for the normal renal function group and the severe renal impairment group, respectively, AVI plasma exposures as measured by AUC24,ss were higher in participants with severe renal impairment compared to those in participants with normal renal function, and C were comparable between the two groups. C was max max observed approximately at the end of the 3-hour infusion with a median T of 2.46 and max 2.92 hours for normal renal function and severe renal impairment groups, respectively. A longer t was observed in participants with severe renal impairment, with a mean value of ½ 6.524 hours compared to a mean value of 3.188 hours for the normal renal function group. The geometric mean CL values were 12.16 and 3.295 L/hr for the normal renal function and the severe impairment group, respectively. The geometric mean V values were 37.37 and ss 27.78 L for the normal renal function and the severe renal impairment groups, respectively. Steady-state generally appeared to have been achieved on Day 1 based on similar median trough (predose) concentrations on Day 1 to Day 3. Urinary recovery of AVI was high with 93.19% and 119.9% of the dose recovered unchanged in urine for the normal renal function and the severe renal impairment groups, respectively. CL was 11.30 and 3.948 L/hr for the normal renal function and the severe renal r impairment groups, respectively. Results for the statistical comparisons of AVI PK parameters (AUC and C ) are 24,ss max presented in Table S9. Total daily exposure (AUC ) was ~24% higher in participants with 24,ss severe renal impairment, compared to the normal renal function group. Peak exposures (C ) were comparable between the two groups. The ratio of the adjusted geometric means max 102.42% (87.55%, 119.83%), respectively, for participants with severe renal impairment, compared to the normal renal function group. Variability in AVI exposure, based on CV%, ranged from 18-20% for AUC parameters and was 14% for C . max Safety Results: An overview of all-causality and treatment related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) is provided in Table S10. No serious AEs (SAEs), severe AEs, permanent discontinuation from study due to AEs, permanent discontinuation from study treatment due to AEs, dose reduction, or temporary discontinuation due to AEs were reported in this study. Five participants experienced all-causality TEAEs, of which 2 were in the normal renal function group and 3 were in the severe renal impairment group (diarrhoea, decreased appetite, and headache, all were mild in severity and resolved). In the normal renal function group, no participant experienced any treatment-related TEAE. In the severe renal impairment group, 3 participants experienced treatment-related TEAEs. Participants evaluable for adverse 6 5 11 There were no individual clinically significant laboratory abnormalities in this study. There was 1 participant who had vital sign change meeting the pre-defined categorical criteria in the severe renal impairment group, which was supine systolic BP change ≥30 mm Hg increase. No participant had vital sign change meeting the pre-defined categorization criteria in the normal renal function group. No vital sign finding was clinically significant nor reported by the investigator as an AE. The values of QTc interval ≥450 milliseconds but ≤480 milliseconds and QTcF ≥450 milliseconds but ≤480 milliseconds were reported in 2 participants each in severe renal impairment group. There were no participants with ECG data that met the pre-specified categorical criteria in the normal renal function group. No vital ECG finding was clinically significant nor reported by the investigator as an AE. Conclusions:  Following multiple infusions of the proposed adjusted ATM-AVI dose regimen (675 mg/225 mg IV q8h) in participants with severe renal impairment, the ATM total daily exposure (AUC ) was ~21% lower and the AVI total daily exposure was ~24% 24,ss higher compared to participants with normal renal function receiving standard dose (1500 mg/500 mg IV q6h). Peak exposure (C ) of ATM was ~24% lower in max participants with severe renal impairment receiving the adjusted dose while AVI peak exposure was comparable to that in participants with normal renal function receiving standard dose.  ATM-AVI was generally safe and well tolerated in participants with severe renal impairment and participants with normal renal function (healthy adults).
