GENERIC DRUG NAME: Trastuzumab COMPOUND NUMBER: PF-05280014 PROTOCOL NO.: B3271004 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Randomized, Double-Blind Pharmacokinetic Study Of PF-05280014 Plus Taxotere® And Carboplatin Versus Herceptin® Plus Taxotere® And Carboplatin For The Neoadjuvant Treatment Of Patients With Operable HER2-Positive Breast Cancer. STUDY CENTERS: The study was initiated at 67 sites in 10 countries (across Europe and the United States), of which 21 sites had no enrollment activity. The remaining 46 sites screened at least 1 patient; of these 2 sites screened but did not randomize any patients to the study (1 site in Russian Federation and 1 site in Ukraine). Two additional sites in Serbia were shipped study drug but did not screen or randomize any patients. Study Initiation Date and Primary Completion or Final Completion Dates: First Patient First Visit: 23 September 2014 Last Patient Last Visit: 09 March 2016. Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Primary Objective: To compare the percentage of patients with steady state (Cycle 5) trough plasma concentration (C ) >20 μg/mL for PF-05280014 versus European Union (EU)-approved trough trastuzumab in patients with operable human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer who received study therapy together with Taxotere and carboplatin in the neoadjuvant setting. Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate measures of tumor control for PF-05280014 versus trastuzumab-EU, when administered in combination with Taxotere and carboplatin in the neoadjuvant setting.  To evaluate the safety of PF-05280014 versus trastuzumab-EU, administered in combination with Taxotere and carboplatin.  To evaluate the immunogenicity of PF-05280014 versus trastuzumab-EU.  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU. Study Design: This was an international, double-blind, randomized, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the pharmacokinetic, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of PF-05280014, a proposed trastuzumab biosimilar, in combination with Taxotere and carboplatin versus trastuzumab-EU (Herceptin®) in combination with Taxotere and carboplatin in patients with operable HER2-positive breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with steady state (Cycle 5) Ctrough (Cycle 6 pre-dose) >20 μg/mL between PF-05280014 versus trastuzumab-EU in patients with operable HER2-positive breast cancer who received therapy together with Taxotere and carboplatin in the neoadjuvant setting. A central bioanalytical laboratory conducted the pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling required for analysis of the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included pCR, objective response rate (ORR), safety, immunogenicity, and selected C . trough The hypothesis to be tested in this study was that the percentage of patients with steady state (Cycle 5) C >20 μg/mL of PF-05280014 was non-inferior to trastuzumab-EU, using a trough margin of -12.5%. Patients were randomized (1:1) to PF-05280014 plus Taxotere and carboplatin or trastuzumab-EU plus Taxotere and carboplatin. Randomization was stratified by primary tumor size (<5 cm, or ≥5 cm), estrogen receptor (ER) status (ER positive versus ER negative) and by progesterone receptor status (progesterone receptor positive versus progesterone receptor negative). In the absence of objective disease progression or prohibitive toxicity, patients received the treatment regimen for 6 cycles. A schedule of study activities is provided in Table 1. Table 1.

End of Treatment: Evaluation performed 28 days after last dose of study drug, ±7 days window – 3 to 7 weeks prior to surgery, unless ADA sampling was being collected. b. Informed Consent: Must have been obtained prior to undergoing any study-specific procedure and could occur prior to the 28-day screening period. c. Medical History and Demographics: Information updated at Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to dosing. d. Physical Examination: A complete physical examination was conducted at Screening and EOT only. All other evaluations were symptom-directed evaluations.e.Vital Signs: Temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate were recorded at all indicated time points. Height was recorded at Screening only. Weight was recorded at Screening and Day 1 of each cycle, as clinically indicated. The weight from Day 1 of each cycle was used to calculate the dosage of trastuzumab to be administered on Days 1, 21, 42, 63, 84 and 105. Vitals were taken on Cycle 1 Day 1 before, within 10 minutes post-trastuzumab infusion, and within 1 to 2 hours post-infusion. On Day 1 Cycles 2 through 6, vitals were taken before and within 10 minutes post PF-05280014 or trastuzumab (study drug) infusions, within 10 minutes post-trastuzumab infusion. Complete vitals were collected at the EOT Visit. f. HER2 Status: Required documentation of HER2 gene amplification or HER2-overexpression as described in Inclusion Criteria. HER2-positive tumor status was based on testing performed by the site at the time of diagnosis, and confirmed by the sponsor-provided central laboratory for all patients. g. ER and progesterone receptor Testing: Only for patients with unknown status. Required documentation of ER and progesterone receptor status as described in Inclusion Criteria h. Hematology and Chemistry: Hematology and chemistry assessments were performed using local laboratories. Additional hematology or chemistry assessments could be performed according to standard of care or as clinically indicated. A visit window of -1 day was allowed for the hematology and chemistry assessments required prior to dosing on Cycle 1, Day 1. i. Pregnancy Test: For patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test with sensitivity of at least 10 mIU/mL was to be performed by the local laboratory at Screening, within 1 week before study drug administration. A negative pregnancy result was required before the patient could Table 1. Schedule of Activities receive the study drug. Pregnancy tests were also done whenever 1 menstrual cycle was missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy was otherwise suspected), on Day 1 of each cycle, and at the EOT visit to confirm the patient had not become pregnant during the study. Additional pregnancy testing may have been necessary if required by local practices or regulations j. Contraception Check: At each study visit, for patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, were biologically capable of having children and were sexually active, the investigator confirmed and documented consistent and correct use of 2 highly effective methods of contraception consistently and correctly for the duration of the active treatment period and for at least 12 months after the last dose of study drug. k. Viral disease screening tests: HBsAg, HBcAb, HCVAb, and HIV were to be conducted by local laboratory where required by local regulations or if warranted by patient history. l. Randomization: All Screening procedures, laboratory results and repeat laboratory results must have been completed and reviewed within the screening period prior to randomization. Randomization of eligible patients was preferred no more than 4 business days before administration of first dose of study drug. m. Study Treatment Administration: On treatment days when both trastuzumab (PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU) and Taxotere and carboplatin were administered, the order of administration was trastuzumab infusion followed by Taxotere and carboplatin infusion. Trastuzumab was administered in a blinded manner consistent with trastuzumab-EU product labeling. The first administration on Day 1, Cycle 1 was a loading dose of 8 mg/kg infused over 90 minutes. The duration of infusion could have been lengthened according to local standard of care or tolerability. Subsequent infusions followed every 3 weeks with a dose of 6 mg/kg administered over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability. Patients received the treatment regimen for 6 cycles. Taxotere and carboplatin were administered every 3 weeks. In the absence of disease progression in the judgment of the investigator or prohibitive toxicity, patients received the treatment regimen for 6 cycles. n. Blood PK Samples: Blood samples were collected for serum. Collection window pre-dose occurred at -2.5 hours to -5 minutes: Every effort was made to collect these PK samples at the exact nominal times, while a variation window of 10% (ie, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time, eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 minute sample, from dosing was not captured as a protocol deviation) was allowed for each sampling time point. The actual time of each sample collection was recorded on the source document and eCRF. Collection window post-infusion: If the duration of infusion differs from the planned duration, the sampling time was adjusted accordingly to occur at 1 hour post the end of infusion, allowing a variation window within 10% of the nominal time. o. Blood Immunogenicity Samples: Whole blood samples (7 mL) were collected to provide approximately 3 mL of serum ADA (1.5 mL) and NAb (1.5mL) samples on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6, and during the 28-day EOT visit. If it was suspected during the safety evaluation that AEs were Table 1. Schedule of Activities immunogenicity-related (per judgment of the investigator), ADA samples at approximately 12 week intervals, were collected until resolution of the AE or up to 6 months from the EOT or the day of early withdrawal. p. Tumor Assessments: CT scan of chest or MRI of chest [only if CT scan cannot be performed] and bilateral mammography or ultrasound of the breast required at Screening for all patients, within 6 weeks prior to randomization. Unilateral repeat mammography or ultrasound of the breast was done at the end of Cycle 3 or, EOT and as clinically indicated. Radiographic assessments obtained per the patient’s standard of care prior to randomization into the study did not need to be repeated and were acceptable to use as Baseline evaluations, if (1) obtained within 6 weeks before randomization, (2) they were performed using the method requirements outlined in RECIST 1.1 (3) the same technique/modality can be used to follow identified lesions throughout the trial for a given patient, and (4) appropriate documentation indicating that these radiographic tumor assessments were performed as standard of care was available in the patient’s source notes. Final disease assessment at the EOT visit included repeat CT scan of chest or MRI of chest [only if CT scan could not be performed] AND unilateral mammography or ultrasound of breast. Assessments were NOT to be scheduled based on the previous imaging time point, but rather based on the calendar from date of randomization. The allowable window for disease assessments was 7 days. q. Adverse Events: AEs (serious and non-serious) were recorded on the eCRF from the time the patient had taken at least 1 dose of study drug through the last patient visit. r. Prior and Concomitant Medication/Non-Drug Treatments: Medications and non-drug treatments were verified at Screening and monitored continuously by the investigator. s. Definitive Surgical Procedure (Lumpectomy or Mastectomy with SN biopsy or ALND): Patients were to undergo a definitive surgical resection of their primary tumor, as part of their standard of care, such as a lumpectomy or mastectomy with SN biopsy or ALND. Surgery was expected to be performed within 3 to 7 weeks after completion of the last dose at Cycle 6. Pathology of tumor sample and pathologic response was assessed by an investigator-designated qualified pathologist, and data was documented by the investigator in the patient source and in the eCRF. A total sample size of N=220 randomized patients was planned to provide 85% power, based on the following assumptions: assuming the percentage of patients reaching steady state in the EU-approved trastuzumab group was 95%, and the percentage of patients reaching steady state in the PF-05280014 group was 93%, then to achieve 85% power with this study design, a minimum of 188 patients (94 per treatment arm) were required. Considering a possible 15% attrition rate for percentage of patients with steady state (Cycle 5) C >20 μg/mL of trough PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU, a total sample size of approximately 220 patients (110 per treatment arm) was planned to be randomized. Overall, there were 226 patients randomized to the double-blind treatment; 1 patient was randomized but did not receive study drug. All randomized patients were included in the ITT population; 190 patients (101 patients in the PF-05280014 group and 89 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) met the requirements for the PP population. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Study participants had to be females over the age of 18 years with histologically confirmed HER2-overexpressing invasive breast cancer and a plan for definitive surgical resection of breast tumor and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were required to have measurable disease in the breast after diagnostic biopsy and known ER and progesterone receptor hormone status at study entry. Documentation of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression was required. Patients with bilateral or inflammatory breast cancer or with presence of known distant metastases were excluded from the study. Patients were excluded if they had received prior treatment, including chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, biologic therapy, radiation or surgery with the exception of diagnostic biopsy for primary breast cancer. Study Treatment: On treatment days when both trastuzumab (PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU) and Taxotere and carboplatin were administered, the order of administration was required to be trastuzumab-EU or PF-05280014 infusion followed by Taxotere and carboplatin infusion. The first administration of PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU on Day 1, Cycle 1 was a loading dose of 8 mg/kg infused over 90 minutes. The duration of infusion could be lengthened according to local standard of care or tolerability. Subsequent infusions followed every 3 weeks (ie, cycled every 21 days) with a dose of 6 mg/kg administered over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability. In the absence of objective disease progression or prohibitive toxicity, patients received PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU for 6 cycles. Taxotere and carboplatin were administered every 3 weeks (ie, cycled every 21 days) for a total of 6 treatment cycles as follows:  Taxotere 75 mg/m2 Day 1 of each Cycle; administered IV over 60 minutes. longer.  In the absence of objective disease progression or prohibitive toxicity, patients received the treatment regimen for 6 cycles. Efficacy, Immunogenicity, and Pharmacokinetic Endpoints: Primary Endpoint Percentage of patients with Cycle 5 C (Cycle 6 pre-dose) >20 μg/mL. trough Secondary Endpoints  pCR defined as the absence of invasive neoplastic cells in the breast and lymph nodes.  Incidence of anti-trastuzumab antibodies (ADA), including neutralizing antibodies (NAb).  Trough trastuzumab-Pfizer and trastuzumab-EU concentrations at selected cycles.  ORR defined as the percentage of patients having Complete or Partial Response at end of treatment (EOT), based on radiographic assessments of the tumor. Safety Evaluations: Safety was characterized by type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness, and relationship to study drug of AEs, including cardiotoxicity, signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, infusion-related reactions (IRRs), and laboratory abnormalities. Hematology and blood chemistry tests were performed at protocol specified time points. Viral disease screening was performed at the Screening visit only by local laboratories to demonstrate eligibility. A physical examination including an examination of all major body systems was required at Screening and EOT visits only. During study drug treatment, symptom-directed physical examinations were performed. Vital signs assessed included weight, temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate. Statistical Methods: The hypothesis to be tested in this study was that the percentage of patients with steady state (Cycle 5) C >20 μg/mL of PF-05280014 was non-inferior to EU-approved trastuzumab, trough using a margin of -12.5%. The difference in percentage of patients between the 2 treatment groups was estimated using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, adjusting for the randomization strata of primary tumor size (<5cm, or 5cm), ER status (ER positive versus ER negative) and by negative). A 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between the 2 treatments groups was calculated. If the lower limit of the CI was above -12.5%, the null hypothesis was rejected and PF-05280014 was considered non-inferior to trastuzumab-EU. The primary analysis was performed in the per protocol (PP) population, with a sensitivity analysis being performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population using the same methods.  The PP Population was the primary analysis set. The PP population was defined as all patients who: 1. Had HER2-positive breast cancer and randomized into the study; 2. Received 6 cycles of PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU treatment; 3. Had no temporary delays of PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU treatment lasting more than 1 week; 4. Had no other significant protocol deviations.  The ITT population was defined as all patients who were randomized to study drug assignment designated according to initial randomization. The ITT Population was used to provide sensitivity analyses of the efficacy endpoints. For the primary analysis of the percentage of patients with Cycle 5 C (Cycle 6 pre-dose) trough >20 μg/mL, patients who had a missing Cycle 5 C (Cycle 6 pre-dose) value, were trough considered a non-responder; the patient was included in the denominator but was not included in the numerator. The percentage of patients in each treatment group achieving pCR was determined, using the denominator as the number of patients in the analysis population for each treatment group, excluding patients who were never going to receive surgery. The ORR, the percentage of patients in each treatment group who had complete response or partial response at Cycle 6/EOT, using the independent radiology assessment, was determined, using the denominator as the number of patients in the analysis population for each treatment group. The differences in pCR and ORR between the 2 treatment groups (PF-05280014 minus trastuzumab-EU) were estimated, along with a 95% CI, using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution, adjusting for the randomization strata. The safety analyses were carried out using the Safety Population, defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Population was used for the safety analyses including ADA and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) analyses. Patient listings were statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) according to treatment. Also, the percent change from individual Baseline at EOT was calculated for each patient, and descriptive statistics of the percent change from Baseline were provided by treatment. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: There were 226 patients randomized to the double-blind treatment (Table 2); 1 patient was randomized but did not receive study drug. Of the 225 patients treated, 215 patients (109 patients in the PF-05280014 group and 106 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) completed the study. All randomized patients (n=226) were included in the ITT population. Of these, 190 patients (101 patients in the PF-05280014 group and 89 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) met the requirements for the PP population, which was used for the primary endpoint analysis. For the Safety Population, 225 patients (113 patients in the PF-05280014 group and 112 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) were included. Table 2.

The event leading to study discontinuation from the PF-05280014 group was the Grade 5 SAE of pancytopenia, which is also discussed as a fatal event below. The events leading to study discontinuation in the trastuzumab-EU group were hypokalemia, erythema, and anemia. A single patient died during the study treatment period; this patient was in the PF-05280014 group. This patient died due to pancytopenia on Cycle 6 Day 1; this event was reported as a Grade 5 treatment-related SAE. CONCLUSIONS:  The study met the primary objective; the lower limit of the 95% CI of the stratified difference in the proportion of patients reporting C >20 μg/mL at Cycle 5 (Pre-dose trough Cycle 6) between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU in the PP population was above the non-inferiority margin of -12.5%.  For the measures of tumor control assessed in this study, the results of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU were comparable.  Both treatments were generally well tolerated by study patients, with no clinically significant imbalance in AEs or other safety parameters observed.  Similar to trastuzumab-EU, PF-05280014 appears to have low immunogenicity.  The PK results in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups were comparable.
