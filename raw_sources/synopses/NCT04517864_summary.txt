Month 15E. METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled safety study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ritlecitinib, including the assessments of BAEP and intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF), in adults 18 to ≤50 years of age with ≥25% scalp hair loss due to AA. Approximately 60 adults were to be randomized 1:1 to receive either ritlecitinib or placebo. The total duration of participation in the study was to be approximately 26 months (See Figure S1). At Month 9, the Placebo-Controlled Phase ended, and all participants could enter the Active Therapy Extension Phase and receive ritlecitinib. At Month 6, any participant with a baseline (BL) overall SALT score ≤75 had the option to enter the Active Therapy Extension Phase if the overall SALT score at Month 6 had increased from BL by ≥25 points. In this report, treatment groups during the Placebo-Controlled Phase are referred to as 200/50 mg and placebo. Treatment groups during the Active Therapy Extension Phase are referred to as Ext 50 mg and Ext pbo-200/50 mg. Figure S1. Study Design Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Adults with ≥25% hair loss due to AA (including alopecia totalis [AT] and alopecia universalis [AU]) measured by SALT at screening were enrolled in this study. Participants must have had normal neurological examination, normal hearing and BAEP. Participants with stable unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or stable unilateral ulnar entrapment on neurological examination or history were allowed in the study. Study Treatment: The study interventions were ritlecitinib and matching placebo. In both the Placebo-Controlled Phase and Active Therapy Extension Phase, each participant received a total of 4 tablets once daily (QD) during the initial 4-week period and 1 tablet QD during the remainder of that study phase. To maintain blinding, participants who received ritlecitinib during the Placebo-Controlled Phase received 1 tablet QD of ritlecitinib and 3 tablets of placebo QD for a total of 4 tablets QD during the initial 4-week period of the Active Therapy Extension Phase. Both ritlecitinib and matching placebo were provided centrally by the sponsor. Table S2.

The overall SALT score does not distinguish the reason for hair loss, ie, it includes hair loss regardless of etiology. The non-AA SALT score only takes into account scalp hair loss other than that due to AA. The AA SALT score = overall SALT score – non-AA SALT score. The PGI-C asks the participant to evaluate the improvement or worsening of their AA as compared to the start of the study using a single-item, “Since the start of the study, my alopecia areata has: …”. The participants selected one of seven responses ranging from “greatly improved” to “greatly worsened”. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Evaluations: Not applicable Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included audiology and BAEP evaluations, neurological examinations, evaluation of IENFD and axonal swellings in skin punch biopsies, AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) monitoring, laboratory assessments, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and physical examinations. Statistical Methods: Efficacy The efficacy analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention. Data were summarized according to the intervention they were assigned. In the Placebo-Controlled Phase, change from baseline (CFB) in overall and AA SALT score were analyzed using linear mixed-effects model with BL, treatment group, visit and treatment group by visit interaction as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect with unstructured covariance matrix assumption. For the Active Therapy Extension Phase, descriptive statistics will be presented by initial treatment group. Observed data will be used. For PGI-C response, for the Placebo-Controlled Phase, number and percentage with 95% confidence interval (CI) (based on Clopper-Pearson method) by treatment group, and treatment difference with 95% CI (based on Chan and Zhang’s exact method) were presented. Participants who discontinued from the study for any reason or who switched to Active Therapy Extension Phase before Month 9 were considered as non-responders. For the Active Therapy Extension Phase, number, and percentage with 95% CI (based on Clopper-Pearson method) by initial treatment group will be presented based on observed data. Safety The safety analysis set included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention. Participants were analyzed according to the intervention they actually received. CFB in I-V interwave latency was analyzed using linear mixed-effects model with BL, treatment group, visit and treatment group by visit interaction as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect with unstructured covariance matrix assumption. For participants who switched to the Active Therapy Extension Phase at Month 6, only their data through Month 6 were included in the analysis of the placebo-controlled period. For data in the Active Therapy Extension Phase, descriptive statistics will be presented. For CFB in amplitude of Wave V on BAEP, the same method of linear mixed-effect model as the I-V interwave latency was used for Months 6 and 9 data. For data in the Active Therapy Extension Phase, descriptive statistics will be presented. Absence of Wave V on BAEP data was summarized descriptively using number and percentage of participants by treatment group at each intensity level. For CFB in percentage of IENF with axonal swellings and IENFD in skin punch biopsies, descriptive statistics for continuous variables were presented. IENFD was measured by counting the number of fibers and fiber branches that independently crossed the dermal-epidermal barrier (basement membrane). Secondary branching was excluded from quantification and fragments were not counted. The length of the histology section was measured (mm) and the linear epidermal nerve fiber density was reported as number of intraepidermal nerve fibers/mm. Axonal swellings were counted by axon. Any IENF with single or multiple swellings was counted as a single event, ie, a single axon with axonal swellings. For each participant, data were reported as the percentage of IENF with any number of swellings. In this clinical study report (CSR), the endpoint “axonal dystrophy” refers to the percentage of IENF with axonal swellings. The incidence rates of safety events, significant clinical abnormalities, ECG and vital signs RESULTS This report summarizes the efficacy data from the Placebo-Controlled Phase and all safety data available as of the PCD. Participant Disposition and Demography A total of 131 participants were screened for this study; 71 participants were randomized to double-blind treatment and treated (36 in 200/50 mg and 35 in placebo). Of these, 6 (8.5%) participants discontinued during the Placebo-Controlled Phase: 1 in 200/50 mg due to an AE of prostatitis; 2 due to lost to follow-up (FU, 1 each in 200/50 mg and placebo); 1 in 200/50 mg due to protocol deviation (did not meet inclusion criterion, ie, participant did not have AA); and 2 due to withdrawal by participant (1 each in 200/50 mg and placebo). At the time of the PCD data-cut, 2 participants had completed the Placebo-Controlled Phase and not yet entered Active Therapy Extension Phase. A total of 63 participants entered the Active Therapy Extension Phase, with 32 from 200/50 mg to Ext 50 mg and 31 from placebo to Ext pbo-200/50 mg. Of these, 1 participant in Ext 50 mg was permanently discontinued due to a SAE of Takayasu's arteritis and entered FU phase; 62 participants remained ongoing in the study. Overall, demographic characteristics were balanced between treatment groups:  Mean age was 34.7 years.  There were more females (70.4%) than males (29.6%). Most participants were White (76.1%), 15.5% were Black or African American, and 4.2% were Asian; 11.3% were Hispanic/Latino.  50.7% of participants were from Poland, 35.2% from the United States (US), 11.3% from Canada, and 2.8% from Australia. The median duration of AA since primary diagnosis (8.91 years) was similar between treatment groups. The median duration of the current AA episode was 3.02 years. The distribution of participants by AA severity was balanced between treatment groups:  AA history was similar between treatment groups. A total of 50 participants had non-AT/AU, with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) BL SALT score of 56.9 (27.55), and these characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. The BL IENFD and percentage of IENFs with axonal swellings were balanced between treatment groups:  Mean (SD) IENFD (/mm) for the entire sample was 10.6 (3.87).  Mean (SD) of the percentage of IENFs with axonal swelling for the entire sample were 1.8% (2.27%). Efficacy Results All efficacy evaluations were secondary endpoints. CFB in Overall and AA SALT Score up to Month 9 AA SALT scores decreased from BL through Month 9, with least-square mean (LSM) CFB in AA SALT scores becoming more negative, which indicated improvement in 200/50 mg. At Months 3, 6, and 9, the decrease in LSM CFB in AA SALT scores was larger in 200/50 mg (-23.0, -35.2, and -38.2, respectively) than in placebo (-2.7, -5.1, and -6.8, respectively). The 95% CI for the difference between groups excluded 0 at all timepoints. The results for the overall SALT scores were consistent to those observed for the AA-SALT scores. PGI-C Score Response Defined as Greatly Improved or Moderately Improved up to Month 9 A larger proportion of participants in 200/50 mg were PGI-C responders (defined as 'greatly improved' or 'moderately improved') than in placebo at Months 3, 6, and 9 (55.6%, 58.3%, and 52.8%, respectively). The 95% CI for the difference between groups excluded 0 at Months 3, 6, and 9. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Results (Not Applicable) Safety Results Primary Endpoint CFB in I-V Interwave Latency on BAEP at a Stimulus Intensity of 80 dB at Month 9 BL mean (SD) value (ms) of I-V interwave latency on BAEP at 80 dB was 4.085 (0.1614) in 200/50 mg and 3.989 (0.1946) in placebo on the right side, and 4.103 (0.1531) in 200/50 mg and 3.988 (0.2235) in placebo on the left side. At Month 9:  There were no notable changes from BL in 200/50 mg or placebo on either side. All 95% CIs for the CFB included 0.  There were no notable differences in the CFB in I-V interwave latency between 200/50 mg and placebo on either side. The 95% CIs for the differences included 0.  The mean I-V interwave latency values remained within the range of published normative data (mean [SD]: 4.0 [0.21] ms) used to define normality for inclusion of participants into the study. There is no universally accepted increase in I-V interwave latency that is clinically meaningful; however, audiologists often utilize 2 SDs (0.42 ms) beyond the published mean (4.0 ms) as a starting point for increased surveillance. There was 1 participant in placebo with lengthened I-V interwave latency beyond 2 SDs of the published mean (mean [SD]: 4.0 [0.21] ms) at Month 9. The BAEP results for this participant did not suggest any neuro safety concerns. Secondary Endpoints CFB in I-V Interwave Latency on BAEP at a Stimulus Intensity of 80 dB at Month 6 At Month 6:  There were no notable changes from BL in 200/50 mg or placebo on either side. All 95% CIs for the CFB included 0.  There were no notable differences in I-V interwave latency between the 2 groups on either side. The 95% CIs for the differences included 0.  The mean I-V interwave latency values remained within the published normative data (mean [SD]: 4.0 [0.21] ms) used to define normality for inclusion of participants into the study. There was no participant with lengthened I-V interwave latency beyond 2 SDs of the published mean (mean [SD]: 4.0 [0.21] ms) at Month 6. CFB in Amplitude of Wave V on BAEP at a Stimulus Intensity of 80 dB up to Month 9 BL mean (SD) values (µV) of amplitude of Wave V on BAEP at 80 dB were similar in 200/50 mg (right side: 0.573 [0.1794], left side: 0.562 [0.2002]) and placebo (right side: 0.574 [0.2021], left side: 0.556 [0.1927]). At Months 6 and 9, there were minimal changes from BL (up to -0.051 µV decrease) and percent changes from BL (up to -7.557% decrease) in 200/50 mg and placebo. There were no notable differences in the change in amplitude or percent change in amplitude from BL between the 2 groups on either side. Absence of Wave V on BAEP at Stimulus Intensities Ranging From 80 dB to 40 dB up to Month 9 All participants had Wave V on BAEP present at stimulus intensities ranging from 80 dB to 40 dB up to Month 9, except for 1 participant in 200/50 mg who had absence of Wave V on BAEP at 40 dB on the right side at Month 9. The event was unilateral and showed fluctuations in the presence or absence of Wave V at various intensities on repeat assessments starting at Month 6. Hearing sensitivity remained normal from screening through Month 9. The case was reviewed by a panel of neuroaudiology experts who concluded there brainstem and that the likely explanation for the absence of Wave V was that the evoked response amplitude was too small for it to be identified within the electroencephalogram. CFB in IENFD in Skin Punch Biopsies at Month 9 BL values of IENFD (/mm) in skin punch biopsies were comparable in 200/50 mg (mean [SD]: 10.2 [3.81], median [Quartile 1 {Q1}, Quartile 3 {Q3}]: 9.8 [7.4, 13.3]) and placebo (mean [SD]: 11.0 [3.95], median [Q1, Q3]: 10.7 [7.7, 13.6]). Both at BL and end of Placebo-Controlled Phase (EOP) (Month 9 [or Month 6 for the 2 participants who entered the Active Therapy Extension Phase at Month 6]), the IENFD mean (SD) and median (Q1, Q3) values for 200/50 mg and placebo were consistent with published normal ranges (mean [SD]: 9.8 [3.6]/mm to 13.8 [6.7]/mm, median: 6.6 [5.3, 9.0]/mm). No changes were apparent in consistent There was 1 participant in 200/50 mg with a history of who had symptoms of hypoesthesia in the lower extremities that started intermittently and became chronic. This participant had a decrease in IENFD from BL to Month 9 of -4.2 fibers/mm. At the time of initial adjudication, the adjudication event of interest (EOI) result was paresthesia and dysesthesia (not peripheral neuropathy). Three other participants who had similar or greater decreases in IENFD from or CFB in Percentage of IENF with Axonal Swellings in Skin Punch Biopsies at Month 9 Intra-epidermal axonal swellings are known to occur with low, but variable frequency in healthy individuals at the distal leg. In this study, BL median (Q1, Q3) value of percentage of IENFs with axonal swellings in skin punch biopsies was similar in 200/50 mg (1.0% [0.0%, 3.0%]) and placebo (1.0% [0.0%, 3.0%]). The CFB in percentage of IENFs with axonal swellings was minimal and similar at EOP (Month 9 [or Month 6 for the 2 participants who entered the Active Therapy Extension Phase at Month 6]) between 200/50 mg and placebo. It showed no consistent pattern of change after 9 months of ritlecitinib treatment or placebo. There were no apparent differences between 200/50 mg and placebo. Adverse Events In total, 141 TEAEs (all causalities) were reported in 53 (74.6%) participants as of the PCD, of which 22 TEAEs reported in 15 (21.1%) participants were considered treatment-related by the investigator. A higher proportion of participants in 200/50 mg reported TEAEs or were discontinued/had drug interruption due to AEs. There were no deaths. Two participants had SAEs: 1 in placebo had humerus fracture (severe, not related, recovering); 1 in Ext 50 mg had Takayasu's arteritis (not related, not recovered) and was discontinued from study due to the AE. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Severe AEs occurred in 2 (2.8%) participants, both in placebo: 1 had a humerus fracture (also an SAE) during intense exercises and 1 had a limb injury when . One participant in 200/50 mg was discontinued from study drug due to an AE of prostatitis, but continued study visits without study drug. A total of 7 participants had study drug interruptions due to AEs (6 in 200/50 mg and 1 in placebo), of which 3 participants in 200/50 mg had study drug interruptions due to treatment-related AEs (diarrhea, vomiting; post procedural hemorrhage [bleeding from the biopsy site]; urticaria). The most frequently reported TEAEs (by Preferred Term [PT], 5%) in the total population were coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) (8.5%), nasopharyngitis, headache (7.0% each), acne, acne pustular, nausea, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), dizziness, and hypoesthesia (5.6% each). Of these, nasopharyngitis, headache, acne pustular, vomiting, URTI, and dizziness were reported in a higher proportion of participants in 200/50 mg than placebo. Other Safety Event of Interest One participant in 200/50 mg had varicella zoster virus infection on Study Day 30 (mild, not related). The event met criteria to be reviewed by an external Opportunistic Infection Review Committee and was adjudicated as an opportunistic infection of multidermatomal herpes zoster (nonadjacent or >2 adjacent dermatomes). The AE was localized and the participant received antiviral therapy as treatment. The AE was resolved. No AE of tuberculosis was reported. There were no events adjudicated by an external Cardiovascular Committee as meeting criteria for cardiovascular EOIs. TEAEs in 9 participants (4 in 200/50 mg, 5 in placebo) were adjudicated as meeting criteria for neurological EOI terms. The adjudicated EOI terms included paresthesia and dysesthesia (6), asthenia (1), somnolence (1) and dizziness (not vertigo or presyncope) (1). None met criteria for EOI term peripheral neuropathy. No case met adjudication criteria as an audiological EOI term. No TEAEs were adjudicated as malignancy events. A total of 7 (9.9%) participants had COVID-19-related TEAEs (COVID-19 or positive SARS-CoV-2 test), all reported during the Placebo-Controlled Phase. The number of participants with COVID-19-related TEAEs was similar between 200/50 mg (4) and placebo (3). All of these TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity and were resolved. None of the Clinical Laboratory Evaluation No clinically meaningful mean changes from BL were observed. No SAEs related to laboratory abnormalities were reported. There were no laboratory values that met protocol-defined discontinuation criteria. Vital Signs and ECG Few participants had post-baseline vital signs or QTcF values meeting pre-specified criteria. No participant met the protocol-specified discontinuation criteria of confirmed QTcF >500 msec or increase from BL in QTcF of >60 msec. CONCLUSIONS Efficacy  Ritlecitinib 200/50 mg was superior to placebo on clinician-assessed (CFB-SALT) and patient-reported (PGI-C response) endpoints. Safety  Ritlecitinib was generally safe and well tolerated.  Up to Month 9, there were no notable mean changes from BL in I-V interwave latency on BAEP in ritlecitinib 200/50 mg or placebo, and there were no notable differences in mean I-V interwave latency between the 2 groups. The mean I-V interwave latency values remained within the published normative data.  Up to Month 9, there were minimal changes from BL and percent changes from BL in amplitude of Wave V on BAEP at 80 dB in ritlecitinib 200/50 mg and placebo. There were no notable differences in the change in amplitude or percent change in amplitude from BL between the 2 groups.  CFB swellings groups.  There were no deaths. No severe AEs were reported in ritlecitinib treated participants. SAEs were equally distributed (1 in placebo and 1 in Ext 50 mg). Compared with placebo, a higher proportion of participants on ritlecitinib had AEs leading to discontinuation/study drug interruption.  There was 1 opportunistic infection (herpes zoster, localized) in ritlecitinib 200/50 mg. The event was mild in severity and considered not treatment-related.  The number of participants with TEAEs adjudicated as meeting criteria for neurological EOI terms was balanced between treatment groups in the Placebo-Controlled Phase. There were no events that met adjudication criteria for the audiological EOI terms of sensorineural hearing loss or central hearing disorder.  No clinically meaningful changes from BL in mean hematology, lipids, liver function, and chemistry lab parameters were observed. There were no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs.
