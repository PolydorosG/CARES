Abbreviations: AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time zero extrapolated to inf infinite time; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time zero to the time of the last last observed (quantifiable) plasma concentration; C = maximum observed concentration; max ECG = electrocardiogram; TEAE = treatment emergent adverse event. METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1, non-randomized, open-label study to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on the plasma PK, safety, and tolerability of a single oral dose of PF-07321332 in combination with the PK enhancing agent ritonavir in approximately 16 participants. The study consisted of 2 cohorts: participants without hepatic impairment (Cohort 1) and participants with moderate hepatic impairment (Cohort 2). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Approximately 8 participants with moderate hepatic impairment and 8 participants without hepatic impairment were planned to be recruited to Cohort 2 and Cohort 1, respectively. The enrollment was in a staged manner such that participants with hepatic impairment (Cohort 2) were enrolled first. Participants without hepatic impairment (Cohort 1) began recruitment towards after the end of Cohort 2. Participants in Cohort 1 were matched to the average demographics (specifically age and weight; and gender as much as practically possible) of participants in Cohort 2. Participants were between 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent document, with body mass index of 17.5 to 40 kg/m2; and body weight >50 kg (110 lb). Study Treatment: On Day -1, 12 hours prior to dosing of PF-07321332, participants received a 100 mg ritonavir with approximately 240 mL ambient temperature water. On Day 1, following an overnight (or a minimum 6 hour) fast, participants received 100 mg PF-07321332 at approximately 0800 hours (plus or minus 2 hours) and 100 mg ritonavir. Participants received 2 additional doses of 100 mg ritonavir at 12 and 24 hours after receiving PF-07321332. The investigational product information is provided in Table S2. Table S2.

Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs. The term “AE” refers to “TEAE” in this clinical study report. Statistical Methods: PK: The effect of the hepatic impairment on PK parameters were assessed by constructing 90% confidence intervals (CIs) around the estimated difference between Test (moderate hepatic impairment group) and the Reference (normal hepatic function group) using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model based on natural log-transformed data and assuming unequal variances. The adjusted mean differences and 90% CIs for the differences were exponentiated to provide estimates of the ratio of the adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) and 90% CIs for the ratios. Safety: AEs, laboratory data, vital signs data, ECG data, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) relevant data were listed in accordance with the sponsor reporting standard. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 17 participants were assigned to treatment. One participant in the moderate hepatic impairment group was excluded from the safety and PK analysis set as this participant was discontinued due to difficulty in venous access for blood draws on Day 1 prior to dosing with study treatment PF-07321332. The remaining 16 participants received assigned treatment, 8 participants each in both treatment groups. The mean values (standard deviation [SD]) of age for the participants in the normal hepatic function group and the moderate hepatic impairment group were 52.8 (6.16) and 56.1 (9.33) years, respectively. The mean values (SD) of the weight and BMI were group; and 89.66 (7.170) kg and 30.135 (3.3435) kg/m2, respectively, for the moderate hepatic impairment group. Most participants were White in both groups. The demographic characteristics were generally well-balanced between the 2 treatment groups. Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done. Pharmacokinetic and Other Results: Following a single oral dose of PF-07321332 100 mg enhanced with ritonavir 100 mg administered at -12, 0, 12 and 24 hours, median plasma PF-07321332 concentrations were similar between the normal hepatic function group and the moderate hepatic impairment group. PF-07321332 systemic exposure was comparable between the 2 groups. Geometric mean AUC was 15.24 µg•hr/mL and 15.06 µg•hr/mL and geometric mean C was inf max 1.886 µg/mL and 1.923 µg/mL for the normal hepatic function and moderate hepatic impairment groups, respectively. PF-07321332 adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) of AUC and C comparing moderate hepatic impairment (test) to normal hepatic function inf max (reference) were 98.78% (70.65%, 138.12%) and 101.96% (74.20%, 140.11%), respectively. Safety Results: In the normal hepatic function group, 3 AEs were reported by 3 participants, including 1 Injection site pruritus, 1 Dizziness, and 1 Ecchymosis. All events were mild in severity. None of the events were considered related to PF-07321332 or ritonavir. In the moderate hepatic impairment group, 8 AEs were reported by 4 participants, among which 3 AEs (2 Dysgeusia and 1 Somnolence, all mild in severity) were considered treatment related. Other AEs included 1 Nausea, 1 Urinary tract infection, 1 Back pain, 1 Chromaturia, and 1 Dermatitis contact. No deaths, SAEs, severe AEs, discontinuations or dose reductions due to AEs were reported during this study. None of the laboratory abnormalities, vital sign parameters, or ECG changes were considered clinically significant. Conclusions:  PF-07321332 systemic exposure based on geometric mean AUC and C values was inf max comparable between the moderate hepatic impairment group and the normal hepatic function group. PF-07321332 adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) of AUC and inf C comparing moderate hepatic impairment (test) to normal hepatic function max (reference) were 98.78% (70.65%, 138.12%) and 101.96% (74.20%, 140.11%), respectively.  PF-07321332/ritonavir has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in adult participants with normal hepatic function as well as those with moderate hepatic or ECG parameters were observed in the study after single dose of PF-07321332, pharmacokinetically enhanced by ritonavir.
