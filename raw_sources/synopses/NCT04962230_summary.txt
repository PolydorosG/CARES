METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1, fixed sequence, 2-period study to estimate the effect of a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducer, carbamazepine, on the pharmacokinetic (PK) of PF-07321332 and ritonavir in healthy participants. This study consisted of 2 periods. Period 1 included PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg as a single oral dose and Period 2 included carbamazepine on a titration schedule as follows: Days 1, 2, and 3 at 100 mg twice daily (BID), Days 4-7 at 200 mg BID, and Days 8-15 at 300 mg BID (Figure S1). A total of approximately 12 healthy male and/or female participants were to be enrolled into the study. The treatment consisted of a single fixed sequence. Figure S1. Titration Scheme of Carbamazepine in Protocol C4671014 Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Healthy male and female of 18-60 years of age, who were overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac assessment, with body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight >50 kg (110 lb) were eligible for this study. Study Treatment: For the purpose of this study, the investigational products (IP) were PF-07321332/ritonavir and carbamazepine. The IP information is provided in Table S2. In Period 1, Day 1 following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, participants received PF-07321332 300 mg (as two 150-mg tablets), administered orally with ritonavir 100 mg (as one 100-mg tablet) administered orally as a single dose. PF-07321332 and ritonavir were dosed simultaneously. In Period 2, on Days 1 through 15, inclusive, participants received carbamazepine in a titration schedule. Carbamazepine 100 mg (as one 100-mg tablet) BID was administered orally on Days 1, 2, and 3, and titrated up to 200 mg (as two 100-mg tablets) BID on Days 4, 5, 6, and 7. Carbamazepine was eventually titrated up to and maintained at 300 mg (as three 100-mg tablets) BID stably in the rest of Period 2 from Days 8 to 15. Carbamazepine (Period 2 Days 1-15) was administered with or without food on all study days except on Period 2 Day 14 when dosing was under fasting conditions. On Period 2 Day 14, participants received PF-07321332 300 mg (as two 150-mg tablets), administered orally with 100 mg ritonavir (as one 100-mg tablet). PF-07321332 and ritonavir were dosed simultaneously. Table S2.

PF-07321332 100 mg tablets (Lot: 21-DP-00508) were shipped to the Pfizer clinical research unit and were not used in the study. Efficacy Evaluations: Not Applicable Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Blood samples of approximately 4 mL, to provide approximately 1.5 mL plasma for measurement of plasma concentrations of PF-07321332 and ritonavir were collected at Day 1 pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48 hours post-dose in Period 1, and at Day 14 pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48 hours post-dose in Period 2. Blood samples collected for measurement of plasma PK concentrations of PF-07321332 and ritonavir were analyzed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) method in compliance with Pfizer’s applicable standard operating procedures. The following PK parameters for PF-07321332 and ritonavir (Table S3) were calculated for each participant and treatment, as applicable, using noncompartmental analysis of concentration-time data. Samples below the lower limit of quantification were set to 0 ng/mL for analysis. Actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis. Table S3.

Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included physical examinations, vital signs (blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature), electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical monitoring/reporting of adverse events (AEs), clinical safety laboratory assessments, and COVID-19 specific assessments. Statistical Methods: PK: PK concentration set: All participants assigned to IP and treated who had at least 1 concentration measured. PK parameter set: All participants assigned to IP and treated who had at least 1 of the PK parameters of primary interest measured. Safety: All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and who took at least 1 dose of study intervention. Participants were to be analyzed according to the product they actually received. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Twelve participants were enrolled into the study. All 12 participants were treated and 10 completed the study. Two participants discontinued from the study in Period 2; one due to an AE and the other withdrew due to personal reasons. Both participants only took carbamazepine at the time of withdrawal and did not take PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg at Period 2. Of the 12 participants, 11 were male and 7 were White. The median (range) age of the participants was 39.50 (22.0, 56.0) years, and the median (range) BMI was 25.40 (20.2, 29.3) kg/m2. Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done in this study. Pharmacokinetic Results: PF-07321332 Pharmacokinetics Following co-administration of a single oral dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg co-administered with carbamazepine, the geometric mean C of PF-07321332 was max 1300 ng/mL as compared to the geometric mean C of 2210 ng/mL when max PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg was administered alone. Carbamazepine likely reduced the C of PF-07321332 due to its induction effect on intestinal and/or hepatic max CYP3A. Following co-administration of a single oral dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg co-administered with carbamazepine, the geometric mean C of PF-07321332 was max followed by a median T of 1.50 hours post dose compared to 3.00 hours when max PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg was administration alone. PF-07321332 plasma concentrations appeared to decline at a faster rate following co-administration with carbamazepine, with a mean t of 6.05 hours for ½ PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg administered alone compared to 3.85 hours following co-administration with carbamazepine. The geometric mean CL/F of PF-07321332 was 29.17 L/hr following co-administration with carbamazepine compared to the geometric mean CL/F 13.06 L/hr of PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg administered alone. Co-administration of multiple oral doses of carbamazepine titrated up to 300 mg BID decreased single dose PF-07321332 AUC and C by approximately 55% and 43%, inf max respectively. The test/reference ratios (90% CIs) of the adjusted geometric means for PF-07321332 AUCinf and C were 44.50% (33.77%, 58.65%) and 56.82% (47.04%, 68.62%), respectively, max following PF-07321332/ritonavir co-administration with multiple oral doses of carbamazepine (Test) compared to PF-07321332/ritonavir administered alone (Reference). Inter-individual variability for PF-07321332 exposure was higher following co-administration with carbamazepine with geometric %CV for AUC and C of 23% and inf max 33% for PF-07321332/ritonavir administered alone and 58% and 43% respectively following co-administration with carbamazepine. Ritonavir Pharmacokinetics Following co-administration of a single oral dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg co-administered with carbamazepine, the geometric mean C of ritonavir was 96.07 ng/mL max as compared to the geometric mean C of 359.3 ng/mL when PF-07321332/ritonavir max 300 mg/100 mg was administered alone. Following co-administration of a single oral dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg with carbamazepine, the PF-07321332 geometric mean C was followed by a median T max max of 1.98 hours post dose compared to 3.98 hours post dose when administered alone. There was a significant effect of carbamazepine on the systemic exposure of ritonavir as compared to PF-07321332. Carbamazepine titrated up to 300 mg BID decreased single dose ritonavir AUC and C by approximately 83% and 74%, respectively. inf max The test/reference ratios (90% CIs) of the adjusted geometric means for ritonavir AUC and inf C were 16.57% (13.32%, 20.60%) and 25.59% (18.76%, 34.91%), respectively, following max PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg co-administration with multiple oral doses of carbamazepine (Test) compared to administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir alone (Reference). Mean t values for ritonavir were 6.15 hours in the absence of carbamazepine and 3.35 hours ½ in the presence of carbamazepine. Inter-participant variability for ritonavir exposure was higher following co-administration with carbamazepine with geometric %CV for AUC and C of 47% and 46% for inf max PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg administered alone and 61% and 71% respectively following carbamazepine co-administration. Safety Results: No deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), severe AEs, and dose modification, reduction, or interruption were observed due to AEs in Period 1 or Period 2. One participant discontinued from study due to moderate Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (Hyponatremia/Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [SIADH]), which was supposed to be caused by the carbamazepine related AE in Period 2. Among the 22 all-causality AEs, there were 4 AEs reported in 4 participants in Period 1, and 18 AEs in 9 participants in Period 2, respectively, 1 AE in Period 1, and 8 AEs in Period 2 were considered treatment related. The most frequently reported all-causality and treatment related TEAEs by preferred term in participants were Transaminases increased (5 participants, 41.7%). The 5 participants with laboratory abnormalities (Transaminases increased) were reported as mild AEs by the investigator. No participants met the categorical criteria of concern for ECGs. There were 2 instances that met the categorical criteria of concern for vital signs: One instance of supine systolic blood pressure absolute value <90 mm Hg was reported in Period 1 and one instance of supine Conclusion(s):  The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means for PF-07321332 AUC and inf C (90% CIs) were 44.50 % (33.77%, 58.65%) and 56.82% (47.04%, 68.62%), max respectively, following PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg co-administration with multiple oral doses of carbamazepine (Test) compared to PF-07321332/ritonavir administered alone (Reference).  The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means for ritonavir AUC and C inf max (90% CIs) were 16.57% (13.32%, 20.60%) and 25.59% (18.76%, 34.91%), respectively, following PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg co-administration with multiple oral doses of carbamazepine (Test) compared to administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir alone (Reference).  Treatments were generally safe and well tolerated for participants administered either PF-07321332/ritonavir with or without carbamazepine.
