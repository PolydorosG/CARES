Study Objectives and Endpoints Type Objective Endpoint Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; CR = complete response; CSR = clinical study report; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; DLT = dose-limiting toxicity; DOR = duration of response; iRECIST = immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; MTD = maximum tolerated dose; NCI = National Cancer Institute; ORR = objective response rate; OS = overall survival; PD = pharmacodynamic(s); PFS = progression-free survival; PK = pharmacokinetic(s); RECIST = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; RP2D = recommended Phase 2 dose. a. The efficacy exploratory endpoints by iRECIST have not been included in the CSR because the primary and secondary endpoints of the study were not met and the iRECIST use in the clinical practice has declined in the recent years. b. Due to the limited amount of evaluable data and lack of clinical benefit observed from this study, no analyses related to the exploratory PK/PD endpoint were conducted. METHODS Study Design: This was a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b/2 study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of binimetinib, and to assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of binimetinib administered in combination with nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with previously treated microsatellite-stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with documented RAS mutation. The study included a dose finding period in Phase 1b followed by a randomized Phase 2 period (Figure S1). One treatment cycle was defined as 28 days (4 weeks) for all arms. Phase 1b of the study consisted of dose-finding cohorts in Arm 1A (Doublet: nivolumab in combination with binimetinib) and Arm 1B (Triplet: nivolumab plus ipilimumab in combination with binimetinib). All dose-escalation and de-escalation decisions were driven by the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI)-2 design. Phase 2 of the study consisted of 2 arms to investigate the safety and clinical activity of the RP2Ds established from Phase 1b: Arm 2A (Doublet) and Arm 2B (Triplet). Figure S1. Study Design Scheme for Phase 1b (Arm 1A and Arm 1B) and Phase 2 (Arm 2A and Arm 2B) Abbreviations: BID = twice daily; DLT = dose-limiting toxicity; DOR = duration of response; ORR = objective response rate; Q4W = every 4 weeks; Q8W = every 8 weeks; RECIST = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; RP2D = recommended Phase 2 dose; wk(s) = week(s). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Patients ≥18 years of age with MSS mCRC with RAS mutation, who received at least 1 and no more than 2 prior lines of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting, and met at least 1 of the following: were unable to tolerate the prior first-line regimen, experienced disease progression during or after prior first-line regimen for metastatic disease, or progressed during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy, were eligible for participating in the study. Study Treatment: The investigational products in the setting of MSS mCRC with RAS mutation in this study were nivolumab and binimetinib for Arm 1A and Arm 2A, and nivolumab, binimetinib and ipilimumab for Arm 1B and Arm 2B (Table S2). See Figure S1 for the doses and dose regimens in each arm. Nivolumab was administered intravenously (IV) on a every 4 weeks (Q4W) schedule as a fixed dose and not by body weight or body surface area (BSA). Nivolumab may have been diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The initial dose was 480 mg Q4W administered as a 30-minute (± 5 minutes) IV infusion. Close monitoring was required during the infusion and for at least 1 hour after the end of the infusion. Binimetinib was administered orally on a twice daily (BID) schedule and taken without regard to food. Patients were instructed to take binimetinib tablets 12 ± 2 hours apart with a glass of water of approximately 250 mL in the morning and in the evening at approximately the same time every day. Patients were instructed to swallow the tablets whole and not to chew or crush them. Binimetinib was co-administered at the start of the nivolumab infusion (± 5 minutes). Ipilimumab was administered IV every 8 weeks (Q8W). The dose was 1 mg/kg administered as a 30-minute (± 5 minutes) IV infusion, and occurred after the completion of the nivolumab infusion. Ipilimumab may have been diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution or 5% dextrose solution. If nivolumab was permanently discontinued for any reason, ipilimumab was required to be permanently discontinued. Table S2.

ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in each treatment arm. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  ORR per RECIST version 1.1 in Phase 1b.  Duration of response (DOR) per RECIST version 1.1 in both phases. For participants with an objective response, DOR was defined as the time between the date of the first documented confirmed response (PR or CR) and the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause.  Rate of CR per RECIST version 1.1 in both phases. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints:  Progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST version 1.1 in both phases. PFS was defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause.  Overall survival (OS). OS was defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the time of death due to any cause. Pharmacokinetic and Biomarker Evaluations: PK Evaluations: Human blood samples were analyzed for determining concentrations of binimetinib and its active metabolite (AR00426032, also known as N-desmethyl MEK162) using a validated, sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) bioanalytical method in compliance with laboratory standard operation procedures (SOPs). For both binimetinib and its active metabolite AR00426032, the accumulation ratio for minimum plasma concentration (R ) (Day 15 pre-dose acc_Cmin concentration for Cycles 2-5 divided by the Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-dose concentration), dose-normalized when necessary, to account for a dose difference in later cycles, was calculated for each patient. Biomarker Evaluations: C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] and cancer antigen 19-9[CA 19-9]), and baseline MSS and RAS mutation testing. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring, vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, weight and temperature), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), adverse events (AEs), safety laboratory tests, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ophthalmic assessments. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: All efficacy analyses were based on the full analysis set unless otherwise stated. The ORR was calculated within each treatment arm and with exact (Clopper-Pearson) 2-sided 90% and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A similar analysis was provided for the rate of CR. An estimate of the DOR was presented descriptively. For PFS and OS, the survival function was constructed using the Kaplan-Meier (product-limit) method (Kaplan & Meier, 1958). The 25%, median, and 75% PFS and OS (in months) were summarized along with 95% CIs. Kaplan-Meier estimates with 95% CIs at specific time points were summarized as well. PK: All PK analyses were performed based on the PK analysis set unless otherwise specified. Descriptive statistics included arithmetic and geometric mean, median, standard deviation (SD), percent coefficient of variation (CV%), geometric CV%, minimum and maximum. The concentrations of 0 were not included in the geometric mean calculation. The accumulation ratio for C (Day 15 pre-dose concentration for later cycles, 2 through 5, divided by the min Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-dose concentration), R c , were determined for binimetinib and acc_ min AR00426032. These R values were also summarized by cycle and leading dose, as acc_Cmin well as over all patients regardless of dose. Biomarker: All biomarker analyses were performed based on the safety set. The biomarkers statistics by visit. The MSS disease assessment, RAS mutation, and RAS alteration at prescreening/screening were listed by patient and summarized by treatment group. Safety: The safety set was used for summaries of safety data, except for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) for which the dose-determining set was used. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize safety data. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: Unless otherwise specified, “Doublet Arm” refers to Arm 1A and Arm 2A combined, and “Triplet Arm” refers to Arm 1B and Arm 2B combined. A total of 75 participants were enrolled and dosed in the study (Table S3). All the treated participants permanently discontinued the treatment; the most frequent reason was Disease progression (radiological) in each of the 4 treatment arms. A total of 6 participants completed all protocol-specified follow-up: 1 (10.0%) participant in Arm 1A, 1 (9.1%) participants in Arm 1B, and 4 (14.8%) participants in Arm 2B. The most frequent reason of discontinuation from the study was Death. The reason of discontinuation from the study was “Other” for 1 (3.7%) participant in Arm 2B as presented in Table S3; the “Other” reason was AEs for this participant. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Of the 37 participants in Doublet Arm, 24 were male and 13 were female. Most of the participants (30/37) were White. The median age was 60.0 years (range: 31-80), and the median body mass index (BMI) was 25.57 kg/m2 (range: 18.6-53.2). Of the 38 participants in Triplet Arm, 24 were male and 14 were female. Most of the participants (34/38) were White. The median age was 59.5 years (range: 29-78), and the median BMI was 26.12 kg/m2 (range: 18.2-35.0). A total of 37 (100%) and 35 (92.1%) participants had at least 1 record of medical history in Doublet Arm and Triplet Arm, respectively. The baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) was 0 or 1 for all the dosed participants as expected. Efficacy Results: Primary Efficacy Results ORR per RECIST version 1.1 in Phase 2: Of the 27 participants in Arm 2A, no participants achieved a confirmed CR or PR (Table S4). Of the 27 participants in Arm 2B, no participant achieved a confirmed CR and 2 (7.4%) participants achieved a confirmed PR, therefore, the confirmed ORR in Arm 2B was 7.4% (90% CI: 1.3, 21.5). The confirmed ORR in Doublet Arm was 0%. As the null hypothesis was that the response rate was at most 5% and the target response rate was 20% in Doublet Arm, the primary objective in terms of ORR in Doublet Arm was not met. The confirmed ORR in Triplet Arm was 5.3% (90% CI: 0.9, 15.7). As the null hypothesis was that the response rate was at most 10% and the target response rate was 30% in Triplet Arm, the primary efficacy endpoint in terms of ORR in Triplet Arm was not met. Secondary Efficacy Results ORR per RECIST Version 1.1 in Phase 1b: Of the 10 participants in Arm 1A and the 11 participants in Arm 1B, no participant achieved a confirmed CR or PR (Table S4). DOR per RECIST Version 1.1 in Both Phases: The 2 participants in Arm 2B with an objective response had objective progression after response. The DOR was 462 days and 229 days for the 2 participants. Rate of CR per RECIST Version 1.1 in Both Phases: Of all the 75 participants in the full analysis set, no participant achieved a confirmed CR (Table S4). Exploratory Efficacy Results PFS per RECIST Version 1.1 in Both Phases: A numerically higher median PFS was observed in Triplet Arm than in the Doublet Arm. For pooled Doublet Arm, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of median PFS was 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.8, 3.5). For pooled Triplet Arm, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of median PFS was 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.8, 5.6). OS in Both Phases: A numerically higher median OS and higher OS rate at 12 months were observed in Triplet Arm than in the Doublet Arm. For pooled Doublet Arm, the estimate of median OS was 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.9, 9.3). The Kaplan-Meier estimated probability of OS at 12 months was 25.8% (95% CI: 12.2, 41.6). For pooled Triplet Arm, the estimate of median OS was 11.9 months (95% CI: 6.2, 14.9). The Kaplan-Meier estimated probability of OS at 12 months was 47.5% (30.3, 63.0). CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Pharmacokinetic and Biomarker Results: PK Results: The plasma concentrations of binimetinib and its active metabolite AR00426032 tended to be comparable across participants at each timepoint in each study phase (Phase 1b and Phase 2) and each study arm (Doublet Arm and Triplet Arm). The median accumulation ratios for binimetinib C (Day 15 pre-dose concentration for min Cycle 2 divided by the Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-dose concentration) were approximately 1.5 for each study phase using the doublet regimen. There were insufficient data to assess accumulation of binimetinib for the triplet regimen or for timepoints beyond Cycle 2 Day 15. Biomarker Results: RAS mutation and MSS:  Of the 37 participants in Doublet Arm, 37 (100%) were positive for RAS mutation and MSS assessment per local and/or central assay. For RAS mutation, central testing was concordant with local testing. For MSS assessment, 1 participant in Arm 2A had a discordant microsatellite instability (MSI) result by local testing.  Of the 38 participants in Triplet Arm, 37 (97.4%) were positive for RAS mutation and 37 (97.4%) were positive for MSS assessment per local and/or central assay. For RAS mutation, 2 participants (both in Arm 1B) were positive by local testing but negative by central testing. For MSS testing, 1 participant in Arm 1B had a discordant MSI result by local testing. The median CRP at screening was comparable between Doublet Arm (108.60 nmol/L) and Triplet Arm (88.10 nmol/L). The ranges of CRP at screening were similar between Doublet Arm (1.9-2021.0 nmol/L) and Triplet Arm (2.9-1902.9 nmol/L). Most participants had high levels of CA 19-9 and CEA based on laboratory high range cut points. At screening, median levels of CA 19-9 were 88.55 U/mL (range: 2.9-5142.0 U/mL) for Doublet Arm and 140.70 U/mL (range: 4.6-9627.0 U/mL) for Triplet Arm. Median levels of CEA at baseline were 41.20 mcg/L (range: 0.5-1693.0 mcg/L) for Doublet Arm and 133.85 mcg/L (range: 1.9-4686.0 mcg/L) for Triplet Arm. Generally, no notable trends in median CA 19-9 levels and CEA levels were observed over time within Doublet Arm and Triplet Arm. Safety Results: Adverse Events: The following sections presents treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) unless All 75 treated participants were reported with AEs, and 74 (98.7%) participants were reported with treatment-related AEs. A total of 34 (45.3%) participants were reported with serious adverse events (SAEs), and a total of 17 (22.7%) participants were reported with treatment-related SAEs. A total of 16 (21.3%) participants were reported with AEs leading to discontinuation of any study drug. A total of 21 (28.0%) participants were reported with AEs requiring binimetinib dose reduction. A total of 53 (70.7%) participants were reported with AEs requiring binimetinib dose interruption. Of the 9 participants evaluable for DLTs in Arm 1A, 1 (11.1%) participant was reported to have a DLT. Of the 11 participants evaluable for DLTs in Arm 1B, 2 (18.2%) participants were reported to have a DLT. The MTD was determined by clinical decision based on an overall assessment of Phase 1b data. The MTD and RP2D of binimetinib was determined as 45 mg BID for both the doublet and triplet regimens and was used in Phase 2 of the study. A total of 37 (100%) participants in Doublet Arm and 38 (100%) participants in Triplet Arm were reported with at least an AE. The most frequently reported all-causality AEs (≥30%) were diarrhoea, dermatitis acneiform, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, nausea, decreased appetite, fatigue and oedema peripheral in Doublet Arm, and were diarrhoea, dermatitis acneiform, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, oedema peripheral, aspartate aminotransferase increased, rash and nausea in Triplet Arm. A total of 25 (67.6%) participants in Doublet Arm and 29 (76.3%) participants in Triplet Arm were reported with at least a Grade 3 or 4 AE. The most frequently reported all-causality Grade 3 or 4 AEs (≥5%) were blood creatine phosphokinase increased, asthenia, anaemia, hypertension, lipase increased and pericardial effusion in Doublet Arm, and dermatitis acneiform, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, rash, aspartate aminotransferase increased, abdominal pain, alanine aminotransferase increased, anaemia, ejection fraction decreased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, amylase increased, lipase increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, hyponatraemia, pneumonia and pleural effusion in Triplet Arm. Deaths were reported for 57 (76.0%) participants in total, with on-treatment deaths (ie, deaths occurring during treatment or within 30 days of the last study medication) reported for 7 (9.3%) participants (1 [10.0%] in Arm 1A, 2 [7.4%] in Arm 2A, 2 [18.2%] in Arm 1B, and 2 [7.4%] in Arm 2B). The most frequently reported cause of death was disease progression. All-causality SAEs were reported for 17 (45.9%) participants in Doublet Arm and 17 (44.7%) participants in Triplet Arm. The most frequently reported all-causality SAEs were pyrexia and pericardial effusion (each reported in 2 [5.4%] participants) in Doublet Arm, and pneumonia, pleural effusion and pneumonitis (each reported in 2 [5.3%] participants) in Triplet Arm. All other SAEs were reported in 1 participant each. Treatment-related SAEs were reported for 10 (27.0%) participants in Doublet Arm and 7 (18.4%) participants in Triplet Arm. All treatment-related SAEs were reported in 1 participant each except for pneumonitis, which was reported in 2 participants in Triplet All-causality AEs leading to binimetinib discontinuation were reported for 3 (8.1%) participants in Doublet Arm, and 13 (34.2%) participants in Triplet Arm. None of the all-causality AEs leading to binimetinib discontinuation were experienced by ≥2 participants in either Doublet Arm or Triplet Arm. The AEs leading to binimetinib discontinuation also led to nivolumab discontinuation in Doublet Arm and Triplet Arm. The AEs leading to binimetinib discontinuation also led to ipilimumab discontinuation in Triplet Arm. Laboratory Values: For 37 participants in Doublet Arm and 38 participants in Triplet Arm who had at least 1 observation of the given laboratory test, shifts for laboratory abnormalities from ≤Grade 2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline are listed below:  Hemoglobin Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) graded low (3 participants in Doublet Arm and 2 participants in Triplet Arm);  Lymphocytes CTCAE graded low (7 participants in Doublet Arm and 3 participants in Triplet Arm);  Neutrophils CTCAE graded low (1 participant in Doublet Arm);  White blood cell (WBC) CTCAE graded low (1 participant in Doublet Arm);  Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) CTCAE graded high (1 participant in Doublet Arm).  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) CTCAE graded high (5 participants in Triplet Arm; 4 of them were reported as notable ALT>3 × upper limit of normal [ULN]);  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) CTCAE graded high (1 participant in Doublet Arm and 3 participants in Triplet Arm; these participants were all reported as notable AST>3 × ULN);  Albumin CTCAE graded low (1 participant in Triplet Arm);  Alkaline phosphatase CTCAE graded high (5 participants in Doublet Arm and 3 participants in Triplet Arm);  Amylase CTCAE graded high (2 participants in Doublet Arm and 4 participants in Triplet Arm);  Creatine kinase CTCAE graded high (8 participants in Doublet Arm and 4 participants in Triplet Arm);  Lipase CTCAE graded high (5 participants in Doublet Arm and 5 participants in Triplet Arm);  Magnesium CTCAE graded low (1 participant in Doublet Arm);  Potassium CTCAE graded low (2 participants in Doublet Arm);  Sodium CTCAE graded low (3 participants in Doublet Arm and 3 participants in Triplet Arm). Notable ALT (or AST)>3 × ULN was equivalent to ≥Grade 2 post-baseline with baseline value <Grade 2. In Doublet Arm, 2 participants and 4 participants had a notable post-baseline ALT>3 × ULN and AST>3 × ULN, respectively. In Triplet Arm, 7 participants and 9 participants had a notable post-baseline ALT>3 × ULN and AST>3 × ULN, respectively. No participant in either Doublet Arm or Triplet Arm had a notable post-baseline total bilirubin>2 × ULN. There were no Hy’s Law cases reported in the study. Other Safety Evaluations: For 37 participants in Doublet Arm and 38 participants in Triplet Arm, shift for corrected QT interval using Bazett’s correction formula (QTcB) from ≤450 msec at baseline to >450 msec post-baseline was reported for 8 participants in Doublet Arm and 4 participants in Triplet Arm. Shift for corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s correction formula (QTcF) from ≤450 msec at baseline to >450 msec post-baseline was reported for 3 participants in Doublet Arm and 2 participants in Triplet Arm. Conclusion(s): Efficacy:  In Phase 2, the confirmed ORR was 0% for the doublet regimen and 7.4% (90% CI: 1.3, 21.5) for the triplet regimen, which was not considered clinically meaningful.  The pooled response rates of the doublet and triplet arms were 0% and 5.3% (90% CI: 0.9, 15.7), respectively. The protocol did not meet a priori expected response rate, which was defined as clinically meaningful response rate of 20% (doublet) and 30% (triplet), whereas the null hypothesis was that the response rate was at most 5% (doublet) and at most 10% (triplet).  The efficacy results based on ORR, DOR, rate of CR, PFS and OS did not indicate clinical benefit of either the doublet or triplet regimens.  Lack of clinical benefit with the doublet and triplet regimens does not justify further clinical development in patients with colorectal cancer. Safety:  One (11.1%) and 2 (18.2%) participants were reported to have a DLT in Arm 1A and Arm 1B, respectively. The MTD and RP2D of binimetinib was determined as 45 mg BID for both the doublet and triplet regimens.  Both the doublet and triplet regimens exhibited a generally tolerable and manageable safety profile in participants with previously treated MSS mCRC with RAS Mutation. No unexpected or new safety findings were observed. PK:  The plasma concentrations of binimetinib tended to be comparable across participants in Doublet Arm and Triplet Arm. Biomarker:  The CRP levels were comparable between Doublet Arm and Triplet Arm. No notable trends in median CA 19-9 levels and CEA levels were observed over time within Doublet Arm and Triplet Arm.
