Study Objectives and Endpoints 18F-NaF PET/CT = 18F-sodium fluoride positron-emission tomography/computed tomography bone imaging; CRPC = castration-resistant prostate cancer; NaF = sodium fluoride; PSA = prostate-specific antigen; SUV = standardized uptake value. METHODS Study Design: This Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study in patients who were chemotherapy-naïve in the castration-resistant setting with progressive bone-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) was designed to evaluate 18F-sodium fluoride positron-emission tomography/computed tomography bone imaging (18F-NaF PET/CT) as a method to quantify changes in total tumor burden in bone metastases in individual lesions as well as across all lesions, and the heterogeneity of response in those bone lesions after treatment with enzalutamide. Approximately 20 subjects were planned to enroll and 18F-NaF PET/CT imaging was performed during the study. The total duration of this study was approximately 36 months to accommodate a third 18F-NaF PET/CT imaging (NaF-3) in patients without protocol defined disease progression. Following Screening including a Technetium Tc 99m medronate (99mTc-MDP) bone scintigraphy, enrolled patients had baseline 18F-NaF PET/CT imaging (NaF-1) and then by mouth once daily. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was determined at Week 13 when a second 18F-NaF PET/CT imaging (NaF-2) was obtained. Patients with any increase in PSA at Week 13 may have discontinued treatment and proceeded to safety follow-up unless the investigator considered continuation of study drug was beneficial. For all continuing patients, PSA was monitored every 8 weeks after Week 13 and other study assessments were obtained. NaF-3 and a follow-up 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy were performed when PSA progression (an increase of at least 25% AND an absolute increase of at least 2.0 ng/mL above nadir), radiographic progression (bone or soft tissue), or other clinically relevant progression was observed, or at 2 years without progression after initiation of treatment. No 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy were required at the time the NaF-3 bone scan was obtained, if bone disease progression was confirmed earlier on bone scintigraphy obtained at investigator discretion. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Key inclusion criteria were as follows:  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation, or signet cell, or small cell features.  Presence of bone metastatic disease as assessed by at least 2 lesions on whole body radionuclide 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy.  Throughout the study, ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue or prior bilateral orchiectomy (medical or surgical castration).  Progressive disease on androgen deprivation therapy at Screening defined as a minimum of 2 sequentially rising PSA values (PSA1<PSA2<PSA3) assessed by the local laboratory with an interval of ≥1 week between each determination where PSA3 (the Screening PSA) is obtained within 4 weeks before planned enrollment.  Testosterone ≤1.73 nmol/L (≤50 ng/dL) and PSA (PSA3) ≥2 µg/L (≥2 ng/mL) at Screening. In the event of prior androgen receptor inhibitor use, the Screening PSA was obtained at least 4 weeks after the last dose of the androgen receptor inhibitor. Key exclusion criteria were as follows:  Prior enzalutamide, abiraterone acetate, aminoglutethimide, ketoconazole, radium Ra 223 dichloride or other bone targeting radionuclides, or cytotoxic chemotherapy in the CRPC setting for the treatment of prostate cancer or participation in a clinical trial of an investigational agent that inhibits the androgen receptor or androgen synthesis (unless treatment was placebo).  Treatment with hormonal therapy (eg, androgen receptor inhibitors, 5 alpha reductase inhibitors) or biologic therapy for prostate cancer (other than LHRH analogue therapy) within 4 weeks before Day 1.  Initiation of new treatment with denosumab, bisphosphonates, or systemic corticosteroids for treatment of prostate cancer within 4 weeks before Day 1.  Use of an investigational agent within 4 weeks before the Screening visit.  Radiation therapy to bone within 4 weeks before Day 1.  Use of opiate analgesics for prostate cancer pain within 4 weeks before Day 1.  Screening 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy showing a superscan.  Visceral (eg, lung, liver) metastatic disease (biopsy not necessary). Adenopathy is allowed.  Current or previously treated brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease.  History of seizure any time in the past for any reason or any condition that may predispose to seizures. Study Treatment: Enzalutamide 160 mg/day was administered as 4 soft gelatin capsules (40 mg each) by mouth once daily. Subjects self-administered enzalutamide by mouth once daily, with or without food. The capsules were swallowed whole without chewing, dissolving, or opening them. Subjects were not allowed to make up missed or vomited doses; dosing was resumed on the next calendar day unless otherwise instructed.

NaF measurements at these 3 time points are based on the standardized uptake value (SUV), the ratio of tissue radioactivity concentration to the total injected activity per patient mass, lean body mass, or body surface area. These measures were examined globally across all bone lesions for a given patient as well as per bone lesion on an exploratory basis. The SUV measures included:  SUV : Total NaF uptake, which represents the tumor burden across all (global) bone total lesions or in individual lesions  SUV : Heterogeneity of NaF uptake, which represents heterogeneity of lesion activity hetero  SUV : Mean NaF uptake, which represents the average activity of all lesions mean  SUV : Maximum NaF uptake, which represents the activity of the most aggressive max lesion Assessment of Disease Progression The assessment of disease progression included PSA, radiographic (bone and soft tissue), and other clinically relevant events as follows: PSA progression triggering NaF-3 was defined as an increase of at least 25% AND an absolute increase of at least 2.0 ng/mL above nadir. Bone disease progression was defined as the appearance of at least 2 new lesions after required a confirmatory 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy at least 6 weeks later showing at least 2 additional new lesions related to prostate cancer (compared with the previous scan). After Week 13, no confirmation of progression was required if at least 2 new lesions related to prostate cancer were observed. Soft tissue disease was assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained at investigator discretion. Other clinically relevant events of progression were determined by the investigator and may have included, but were not limited to, significant bone pain or skeletal-related events. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Evaluations: Not applicable. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included safety monitoring, adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory test, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Collection and reporting of AE information began at the time the patient signed informed consent for serious adverse events and from the first dose of study drug for nonserious AE, and continued through 30 days after the last dose of study drug treatment or before initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, a lutamide (bicalutamide, nilutamide, or flutamide), or a new investigational therapy, whichever occurred first. Statistical Methods: All efficacy analyses were based on the as treated (AT) population. Any confidence intervals (CIs) presented were 2-sided 95% CI. No adjustments to the CIs were planned for any multiple testing. The primary endpoint was summarized with number and percent of patients with ≥1 responding bone lesions at NaF-3 along with the 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method. The secondary endpoints were described using summary statistics and graphical displays utilizing histograms were produced. AE incidence was summarized with frequency and percentage by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Clinical laboratory parameters and vital signs were summarized using descriptive statistics and change from baseline was calculated for these parameters. ECOG was summarized using descriptive statistics and observed ECOG was tabulated over time. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A summary of patient disposition for all treated patients is presented in Table S3. Overall 23 patients were included in the study and (OLE) study (NCT02960022). The most common reason for study drug discontinuation for all treated patients was disease progression (16 [69.6%]). Most patients were in the 65 to 74 years old (9, 39.1%) or 75 to 84 years old (7, 30.4%), White (21, 91.3%), and Non-Hispanic and Non-Latino (22, 95.7%). Table S3.

Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, Immunogenicity and/or Other Results: Not applicable. Safety Results:  Treatment-related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported for 19 (82.6%) patients and the most frequently reported TEAE was fatigue (17 [73.9%] patients).  One (1) death was reported: an unrelated completed suicide within 30 days after last dose of study drug.  Serious TEAEs were reported for 9 (39.1%) patients.  TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation were reported for 4 (17.4%) patients.  TEAE leading to temporary discontinuation were reported for 8 (34.8%) patients.  TEAE leading to dose reduction were reported for 5 patients (21.7%). Conclusions: The use of 18F-NaF PET/CT imaging as a method for determining treatment response in metastatic bone lesions was evaluated. All 22 evaluable patients had responding bone lesions at the time of disease progression (PSA, bone or soft tissue, or other clinically relevant progression) or at 2 years without progression. Safety profile was consistent with prior studies of the study drug and no new safety signals were observed.
