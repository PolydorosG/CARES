CSR Version and Report Date: Final, 06 Mar 2022 Number of Study Centers and Investigators: Twelve participants were enrolled in this study. This study was conducted by principal investigator at 1 center in Japan. A list of study centers and investigators involved in this study is provided in Appendix 16.1.4.1. Publications: None Study Period: The study was initiated on 30 June 2021 and completed on 09 September 2021. This study was neither discontinued nor interrupted. Rationale: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the multiple-dose safety, tolerability, skin irritation potential, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-07038124 in Japanese healthy participants. The data provided in this study support for clinical development in Japanese participants with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.  Methodology: This was a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel cohort study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, skin irritation potential, and PK of PF-07038124 in Japanese healthy adult participants. This study consisted of 2 cohorts to evaluate 2 administration areas in parallel: PF-07038124 at 0.01% concentration and vehicle to 2000 cm2 of skin (Cohort 1; approximately 10% body surface area [BSA]) or 4000 cm2 of skin (Cohort 2; approximately 20% BSA). Participants were randomized to receive PF-07038124 or vehicle in a ratio of 4:2 (4 PF-07038124: 2 vehicle) per cohort. Each participant received multiple doses of PF-07038124 or vehicle, starting on Day 1 topically applied for 10 consecutive days; applied once daily (QD) in the AM for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. The total participation time for each participant was approximately 66 days, including the screening period of up to 28 days, the double-blind treatment period of 10 days, and the follow-up period of 28 days from last dose of the study intervention. Number of Participants (Planned and Analyzed): Approximately 12 Japanese healthy adult participants were planned to participate in this study. Overall, 12 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to the treatment and were included in the safety analysis set. The 8 participants of PF-07038124 treatment group were included in the PK analysis set. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Enrolled in this study were male and female healthy participants who were 20 to 55 years of age, inclusive, with body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 25 kg/m2 and a total body weight 50 kg (110 lb); participants had 4 biologically Japanese grandparents who were born in Japan; participants who were willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures. Participants were excluded if they had any visible skin damage or skin condition (eg, sunburn, excessively deep tans, uneven skin tones, tattoos, scars, excessive hair, numerous freckles, or other disfigurations); had a history of or had active forms of dermatitides/eczematous conditions or other inflammatory skin diseases that would interfere with evaluation of the test site reaction; had undergone significant trauma or major surgery within 4 weeks of screening. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): The study intervention was applied in blinded fashion, at the clinical research unit. All applications of the study intervention were dispensed and applied by study site staff from Day 1 through Day 10. Every effort was made for the dose applications on Day 2 to Day 10 to be completed at 24 ± 2 hour intervals from the recorded time of completion of the Day 1 The application area included a treatment area of 2000 cm2±200 cm2 (approximately 10% BSA) for Cohort 1. For Cohort 2, the treatment area was 4000 cm2±400 cm2 (approximately 20% BSA). The application area included the back as well as other extremities, abdomen and/or chest, identified by the investigator. Table S2. Study Interventions Administered CCI Duration of Study Intervention: The study intervention was applied QD for 10 consecutive days from Day 1 AM through Day 10 AM. Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: All enrolled participants were male, Asian (Japanese), and between 33 to 53 years old. The total mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 41.6 (7.46) years. Across all treatment groups, body weight ranged from 52.5 to 74.6 kg and BMI ranged from 17.6 to 24.4 kg/m2. Exposure: All participants completed treatment for 10 days in Cohorts 1 and 2. Safety Results: In total, 1 all-causality mild treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was reported and was not considered to be treatment-related by the investigator. One participant in PF-07038124 4000 cm2 treatment group experienced a TEAE of alanine aminotransferase increased of mild severity (Table S3). In general, all participants were rated with Score 0 using Draize scoring and did not have any visible skin reaction. There were no deaths, serious adverse events (AEs), severe AEs, permanent discontinuations, temporary discontinuations or dose reductions due to AEs reported in this study. None of the laboratory abnormalities were reported as an AE or considered clinically significant. No change from baseline in electrocardiogram and vital signs were considered clinically significant and none were reported as an AE. Pharmacokinetic Results: The PK of PF-07038124 were assessed on Day 1, Day 4, Day 7, and Day 10. All concentrations on Day 1, Day 4, and Day 7 were below the limit of quantification (BLQ) for both treatments. The majority of concentrations on Day 10 were BLQ: up to 24 hours postdose, 93% and 65% of plasma PK samples of PF-07038124 were BLQ of 10 pg/mL for PF-07038124 2000 cm2 treatment and PF-07038124 4000 cm2 treatment, respectively. Based on high percentage of BLQ values were observed, a limited number of participants had valid parameter values. The geometric mean (minimum, maximum) in area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to time tau, the dosing interval, where tau = 24 hours (AUC ) on Day 10 tau for PF-07038124 4000 cm2 treatment was 0.1650 pg•hr/mL (0.000, 287 pg•hr/mL). The geometric mean (minimum, maximum) in maximum plasma concentration (C ) on Day 10 max for PF-07038124 2000 cm2 treatment and PF-07038124 4000 cm2 treatment was 0.001965 pg/mL (0.000, 14.9 pg/mL) and 0.03911 pg/mL (0.000, 17.6 pg/mL), respectively. It’s hard to assess the dose-proportionality because the valid parameter values were limited; however, number of concentrations that were above the upper limit of quantitation of PF-07038124 4000 cm2 treatment was higher than that of PF-07038124 2000 cm2 treatment. Inter-participant variability for PF-07038124 exposure based on geometric percent coefficient of variation were large because the majority of concentrations were BLQ. Pharmacodynamic Results: (Not Applicable) Other Results: (Not Applicable) Conclusions: Safety: All 4000 systemically in PK: Following multiple topical administration of PF-07038124 in Japanese healthy participants, all concentrations were BLQ on Day 1, Day 4, and Day 7. The majority of concentrations were BLQ on Day 10: up to 24 hours postdose, 93% and 65% of plasma PK samples of PF-07038124 were BLQ of 10 pg/mL for PF-07038124 2000 cm2 treatment and PF-07038124 4000 cm2 treatment, respectively.
