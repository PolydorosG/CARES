GENERIC DRUG NAME AND/OR COMPOUND NUMBER Bococizumab/PF-04950615 PROTOCOL NO.: B1481030 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Double-Dummy, Randomized, Placebo and Active Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to Assess the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of PF-04950615 in Subjects With Dyslipidemia Who Are Intolerant to Statins Study Center(s): Thirty-two (32) centers randomized subjects and took part in the study, 26 centers in the United States (US) and 6 centers in Canada. Study Initiation Date and Final Completion Date: Study Initiation Date: 04 June 2014 Final Completion Date: 03 November 2015 Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Primary Objective:  To demonstrate a superior low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering effect of bococizumab 150 mg administered by the subcutaneous (SC) route every 2 weeks (Q2W) compared to placebo, in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia who were unable to tolerate statins because of muscle-related adverse events (AEs), and whose LDL-C was 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at baseline. Secondary Objectives:  To demonstrate a superior effect of bococizumab 150 mg administered by the SC route Q2W compared to placebo, in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia who were unable to tolerate statins because of muscle-related AEs, and whose LDL-C was 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at baseline on:  Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and non-HDL-C; (ApoA-I), apolipoprotein A-II (ApoA-II), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C).  To compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of bococizumab 150 mg administered by the SC route Q2W for 12 weeks to placebo, in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia who were unable to tolerate statins because of muscle related AEs and whose LDL-C was 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L). METHODS Study Design: This study was a Phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo and active re-challenge, randomized, parallel group multicenter clinical trial, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of bococizumab 150 mg SC Q2W and atorvastatin placebo orally (PO) once daily (QD) to bococizumab placebo SC Q2W plus atorvastatin placebo PO QD, for LDL-C lowering in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia who were intolerant to effective doses of statins because of muscle-related AEs. The study planned to enroll approximately 150 subjects in 3 treatment groups, randomized 2:2:1 to either bococizumab, placebo, or a re-challenge with atorvastatin 40 mg (Figure 1). Randomized subjects received study drug for 24 weeks. After providing consent, subjects entered a screening and run-in period of approximately 6 weeks to verify eligibility for the study and to washout statins for subjects who were on low dose or intermittent statin therapy. Eligible subjects were considered enrolled and progressed to the baseline visit. Results from screening evaluations were reviewed and only subjects who continued to meet all eligibility criteria were randomized to treatment. Within each country, subjects were randomized to 1 of the 3 groups as described in Figure 1. Randomized subjects then entered the 24-week treatment period, followed by a 6-week follow-up, for a total of 36 weeks of study participation. Subjects attended clinic visits as shown in the schedule of activities (Table 1). Figure 1.

The study planned to enroll approximately 150 subjects in 3 treatment groups, randomized 2:2:1 to either bococizumab, placebo, or a re-challenge with atorvastatin 40 mg. There were 284 subjects screened for study participation. During the study, 184 subjects were randomized to study treatment and analyzed for efficacy (full analysis set [FAS]). Of these, 183 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug (safety analysis set); 73 subjects received placebo, 74 subjects received bococizumab, and 36 subjects received atorvastatin. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Male and female subjects 18 years of age with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia requiring treatment with a statin were eligible for inclusion in this study. Subjects were required to be statin intolerant (defined as unable to tolerate at least 2 statins, 1 at the lowest starting daily dose and another at any dose, or as subjects receiving less than the lowest daily approved dose of a statin) with Day 14 fasting LDL-C 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) and fasting TG ≤400 mg/dL (4.51 mmol/L). Subjects who were on a lipid-lowering therapy other than a statin at screening (eg, fibrates, cholesterol absorption inhibitors [ie, ezetimibe], niacin, omega-3 fatty acids) were allowed to continue on their medication if the dose remained unchanged for at least 6 weeks prior to screening. No dose adjustments for these medicines were allowed for the duration of this study. Pregnant or breastfeeding female subjects, subjects with history of a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event or procedure (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and angioplasty) during the past 90 days, subjects with poorly controlled hypertension at any screening visit or at randomization (defined as the average of 2 systolic blood pressure [SBP] measurements >160 mm Hg or the average of 2 diastolic blood pressure [DBP] measurements >100 mm Hg), and subjects who had severe or life-threatening AEs associated with past statin use including rhabdomyolysis, elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) >10 × upper limit of normal (ULN), creatine kinase (CK) >10 × ULN, or evidence of target organ damage such as renal impairment with use of statins at any time were ineligible to participate in this study. Study Treatment: Subjects were randomized into 1 of 3 parallel groups:  Bococizumab 150 mg SC Q2W + atorvastatin placebo PO QD (bococizumab group);  Bococizumab placebo SC Q2W + atorvastatin placebo PO QD (placebo group);  Atorvastatin 40 mg PO QD + bococizumab placebo SC Q2W (atorvastatin group). Each subject was to receive 12 SC injections over the period of 24 weeks, on Days (-1/+4 window range) 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141, and 155. same time each day, with or without food, for 24 weeks. Efficacy Endpoints: Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  Percent change from baseline (CFB) in fasting LDL-C at Week 12. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:  Percent CFB in fasting TC, ApoB, and non-HDL-C at Week 12;  Percent CFB in fasting Lp(a) at Week 12;  Percent CFB in fasting HDL-C at Week 12. Non-HDL-C was calculated as the difference between TC and HDL-C, both collected on the same day: Non-HDL-C = TC – HDL-C Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  Percent CFB in fasting LDL-C, TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, Lp(a) and HDL-C at Week 24;  Percent CFB in fasting TG, ApoA-I, and ApoA-II, VLDL-C at Weeks 12 and 24;  Absolute CFB in fasting LDL-C, TC, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, ApoB, and Lp(a) at Week 12;  Absolute CFB in fasting TC/HDL-C ratio and ApoB/ApoA-I ratio at Weeks 12 and 24;  Proportion of subjects achieving fasting LDL-C 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) LDL-C at Weeks 12 and 24;  Proportion of subjects achieving fasting LDL-C 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at Weeks 12 and 24. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Blood samples were collected for the analysis of plasma bococizumab concentrations on visit Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 169, and 211. Blood samples were collected into dipotassium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (K EDTA) tubes for the analysis 2 of plasma bococizumab concentrations by a validated, sensitive, and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. A secondary endpoint was plasma bococizumab concentrations at Weeks 12 and 24. Safety was assessed by physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory results, and the spontaneous reporting of AEs in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. In addition, blood samples were collected for assessment of anti-drug (bococizumab) antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (nAb). Safety endpoints were as follows:  Incidence and severity of AEs.  Incidence and titer of ADAs and nAbs.  Proportion of subjects discontinuing treatment due to myalgia, myopathy, CK, and LFT elevations. Statistical Methods: The FAS was the primary analysis set for the analysis of efficacy data in this study. The FAS included all subjects who were randomized. The safety analysis set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects were analyzed according to their randomized treatment group regardless of any dose adjustments or adherence to study drug. Analysis of Primary Endpoint: Percent CFB to Week 12 in fasting LDL-C by direct method was analyzed with a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The dependent variable in the model was the percent CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 12 in the bococizumab and placebo treatment groups. Country and baseline LDL-C were covariates. There was no imputation for missing data in the primary analysis. All LDL-C measurements were included in the primary analyses regardless of treatment compliance. Data up to and including Week 12 were used in the model regardless of whether the subject remained on treatment or had discontinued treatment and remained in the study. All 3 treatment groups were included in the primary analysis; however, treatment differences were only reported for the primary comparison of interest: bococizumab and atorvastatin placebo (bococizumab group) compared to bococizumab placebo and atorvastatin placebo (placebo group). To support the robustness of the conclusions drawn from this analysis, several sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the dropout pattern and its possible impact on treatment comparisons. Multiple imputation analyses utilizing known covariates to be predictive of response (eg, baseline LDL-C) were explored, and to cover the scenario that the data were not missing at random, a pattern mixture model was explored. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was also done as a sensitivity analysis using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), including fixed effects terms for treatment group (categorical), baseline LDL-C, and country. Furthermore, a center-at-baseline analysis was done where missing data in the bococizumab group, considered to be off-treatment, were imputed to previous levels seen at baseline. An analysis similar to the primary analysis was also performed, except only 2 weeks after their last dose), was used in the model. This approach essentially analyzed the data collected while on treatment and ignored data collected off-drug-in-study (ODIS). Analysis of Secondary Endpoints: The key secondary endpoints were analyzed in a similar manner as the primary endpoint, where an MMRM model was used. For each endpoint, its baseline value was used in the MMRM model as a continuous covariate. Similar to the primary endpoint, data up to and including Week 12 were used in the model regardless of whether the subject remained on treatment or had discontinued treatment and remained in the study. For Lp(a), the data were also log-transformed for analysis as a supplemental analysis. Descriptive and graphical summaries by treatment group and time point were presented. Sensitivity analyses using the center-at-baseline approach, similar to that used for the primary endpoint, were performed for key secondary endpoints to assess the robustness of the model to missing data. The secondary endpoints not designated as key for change and percent CFB were analyzed in a similar manner as the primary endpoint, where an MMRM model was used. The respective baseline value of the endpoint was used in the MMRM model as a continuous covariate. For the secondary endpoints, 2 MMRM models were fitted: one that included all data up to and including Week 12 and another that included all data up to and including Week 24, regardless of whether the subject remained on treatment or had discontinued treatment and remained in the study. Endpoints at Week 12 were derived from the Week 12 model. Endpoints at Week 24 were derived from the Week 24 model. For TG and Lp(a), the data were also log-transformed for analysis as a supplemental analysis. Descriptive and graphical summaries by treatment group and time point were also presented. Sensitivity analyses using the center-at-baseline approach, similar to that used for the primary endpoint, were performed for select secondary endpoints, to assess the robustness of the model to missing data. The proportion of subjects having fasting LDL-C at or below certain levels (100 mg/dL, 70 mg/dL) was analyzed with a logistic regression model. Terms in the model included treatment (categorical), country (categorical), and baseline LDL-C (continuous). Summary measures from the analysis included the odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio, and 2-sided p-value for each treatment comparison. Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Data:  Descriptive summaries and mean plots of plasma bococizumab concentrations were provided. Analysis of Safety Parameters: Safety data were summarized according to the sponsor data standards. AEs leading to elevations was recorded. Deaths were listed individually. In addition, listings of adjudicated events for deaths, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), revascularization, hospitalization due to congestive heart failure (CHF), and cerebrovascular events were provided in accordance with the Cardiovascular Events Adjudication Committee (CEAC) charter. Additionally, a 3-tier approach was used to summarize AEs. Tier-1 AEs were AEs of special clinical interest (Anaphylactic reaction, drug-induced liver injury [DILI], Hepatotoxicity, severe injection site AEs mapping to the (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]) higher level term [HLT] of injection site reactions, Jaundice, and Rhabdomyolysis) specified in the Safety Review Plan. For these events, the percentage of subjects with AEs, the risk difference versus placebo, the associated 95% CI, and p-value were provided. The CIs and p-values were not adjusted for multiplicity and were provided for screening purposes only. Tier-2 AEs were those that were common, occurring in 5% of subjects in any treatment group. For these events, the percentage of subjects with AEs, the risk difference versus bococizumab placebo and atorvastatin placebo, and the associated 95% CI were provided. The CIs were for estimation purposes only. All AEs were Tier-3 events and were summarized as described above. SAE presentations were derived from a combination of data in the clinical study database and the corporate safety database. The corporate safety database was a separate, centralized, AE monitoring database that was continuously updated based on rapidly communicated reports from the investigators to the sponsor. SAEs with onset during the treatment period were tabulated by treatment group using the MedDRA. The treatment and the follow-up period were reported together. SAEs with onset during the screening period were summarized. Deaths were also listed. Significant clinical laboratory findings identified after dosing were recorded as an AE. Any abnormal physical examination changes identified as clinically significant by the investigator were recorded as AEs. Immunogenicity Analysis: The following data summaries were provided for ADA and nAb data:  Incidence of ADA and nAb;  ADA titer and nAb titer. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition is summarized in Table 2. Of the 284 subjects screened for study participation, 184 subjects were randomized to study treatment and analyzed for efficacy (FAS). Of these, 183 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug (safety analysis set); 73 subjects received placebo, 74 subjects received bococizumab, and 36 subjects received atorvastatin. 172 (93.5%) completed the study.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The analysis of percent CFB in fasting LDL-C (mg/dL) (FAS) at Week 12 is presented in Table 4. A superior LDL-C lowering effect of bococizumab compared to placebo was demonstrated (P <0.001), with an adjusted mean treatment group difference at Week 12 of -54.5% (95% CI: -60.1, -49.0). Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The analyses of percent CFB for the key secondary endpoints at Week 12 are presented in Table 4. A superior TC lowering effect of bococizumab compared to placebo was demonstrated (P <0.001) with an adjusted mean treatment group difference at Week 12 of -38.4% (95% CI: -42.6, -34.2).

The mean ADA and nAb titers observed from Weeks 4 to 30 ranged from 9.46 to 10.12, and 2.57 to 3.82, respectively.  This Phase 3 study demonstrated a superior LDL-C lowering effect of bococizumab 150 mg administered SC Q2W compared with placebo, with bococizumab 150 mg Q2W treatment achieving a Week 12 LDL-C reduction of -54.5% (95% CI: -60.1, -49.0; P <0.001).  The study demonstrated a superior effect of bococizumab 150 mg Q2W treatment compared with placebo on TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, and Lp(a) (all reduced), and on fasting HDL-C (elevated). This study also showed that, compared with placebo, bococizumab 150 mg Q2W treatment resulted in greater reductions in TG, VLDL-C, TC/HDL-C and ApoB/ApoA-I ratios, a greater proportion of subjects achieving fasting LDL-C values 100 mg/dL, and greater elevations in ApoA-I and ApoA-II. Subjects randomized to bococizumab 150 mg Q2W were more likely to achieve LDL-C values ≤100 mg/dL and ≤70 mg/dL compared to atorvastatin 40 mg QD and placebo.  Bococizumab 150 mg Q2W treatment was generally well tolerated, with similar overall safety results as the placebo group. The Injection site reaction PT was recorded more frequently in subjects in the bococizumab 150 mg Q2W group compared with the placebo group. Musculoskeletal AEs were frequently recorded in subjects in this study, with similar incidences across all treatment groups.  SAEs were similar across treatment groups. One subject in the bococizumab 150 mg Q2W group died due to AEs coded to the PTs Pneumonia aspiration and Multi-organ failure. These AEs were not considered treatment related.  The overall incidence of ADA and nAb in bococizumab-treated subjects was 48.6% and 25.0%, respectively.
