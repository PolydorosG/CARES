Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study conducted at investigator sites in the United States and Sweden. Approximately 3880 adults 18 years of age and older with no history of pneumococcal vaccination were to be enrolled and assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts based on their age at enrollment and randomized to a 20vPnC group or a control group. Approximately 3000 participants were to be enrolled into Cohort 1, 2000 participants were 60 through 64 years of age, and 1000 participants were 65 years of age and older. Participants were stratified by age and randomized (1:1) to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC (control vaccine) at Vaccination 1 (Visit 1). Participants who received 20vPnC at Vaccination 1 received saline at Vaccination 2 (Visit 2), and those who received 13vPnC at Vaccination 1 received PPSV23 at Vaccination 2 (Visit 2). Approximately 440 participants 50 through 59 years of age were to be enrolled into Cohort 2 and randomized (3:1) to receive a single dose of 20vPnC or 13vPnC at Visit 1. Approximately 440 participants 18 through 49 years of age were to be enrolled into Cohort 3 and randomized (3:1) to receive a single dose of 20vPnC or 13vPnC at Visit 1. Participants in Cohort 1 completed immunogenicity and safety assessments at Visits 1, 2 (28 to 42 days after Visit 1), and 3 (28 to 42 days after Visit 2). Participants in Cohorts 2 and 3 completed immunogenicity and safety assessments at Visits 1 and 2 (28 to 42 days after Visit 1). Participants in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 completed their final visit (safety assessment only) approximately 6 months (168 to 196 days) after Visit 1 via telephone. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Key inclusion/exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion Criteria: • Cohort 1: Male or female adults 60 years of age and older. Cohort 2: Male or female adults 50 through 59 years of age. Cohort 3: Male or female adults 18 through 49 years of age. • Adults determined by clinical assessment, including medical history and clinical judgment, to be eligible for the study, including adults with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy in the previous 6 weeks or hospitalization for worsening disease within 12 weeks before receipt of investigational product. Exclusion Criteria: • Previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational pneumococcal vaccine, or planned receipt through study participation. • History of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of 20vPnC, 13vPnC, or any other diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine or PPSV23. • Serious chronic disorder including metastatic malignancy, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen, end -stage renal disease with or without dialysis, clinically unstable cardiac disease, or any other disorder that, in the investigator’s opinion, excluded the participant from participating in the study. • Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may have increased the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may have interfered with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would have made the participant inappropriate for entry into this study. • History of microbiologically proven invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae. • Participants who received treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic agents or systemic corticosteroids, or planned receipt through the last blood draw. If systemic corticosteroids had been administered short term (<14 days) for treatment of an acute illness, participants should not have been enrolled into the study until corticosteroid therapy had been discontinued for at least 28 days before investigational product administration. Inhaled/nebulized, intra-articular, intrabursal, or topical (skin or eyes) corticosteroids were permitted. • Participants with known or suspected immunodeficiency or other conditions associated with immunosuppression, including, but not limited to, immunoglobulin class/subclass deficiencies, generalized malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, leukemia, lymphoma, or organ or bone marrow transplant. Vaccines Administered: At Vaccination 1 in Cohort 1 and for the single vaccination administered to Cohorts 2 and 3, a 0.5-mL dose of 20vPnC or 13vPnC was administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm by a blinded site staff member (20vPnC and 13vPnC have the same appearance). At Vaccination 2 (Cohort 1 only), a 0.5-mL dose of saline or PPSV23 was prepared and administered by third-party unblinded site staff member(s) and was administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm to blinded participants. All other study personnel including the principal investigator, and the participant, were blinded. The unblinded site staff members did not participate in participant assessments. Immunogenicity Evaluations: Blood samples were collected from all participants at Visit 1 (prior to administration of 20vPnC or 13vPnC for participants in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3), Visit 2 (before administration of saline or PPSV23 for participants in Cohort 1), and Visit 3 (participants in Cohort 1). OPA titers for serotypes present in 20vPnC (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F) were determined on all sera collected prior to study vaccination and 1 month (28 to 42 days) after Vaccination 1 in Cohort 1 and 1 month (28 to 42 days) after vaccination in Cohorts 2 and 3. OPA titers for the 7 additional serotypes only (8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F) were determined on sera collected 1 month (28 to 42 days) after Vaccination 2 in Cohort 1. Safety Evaluations: Participants recorded local reactions for 10 days, and systemic events and antipyretic/pain medication usage for 7 days, each evening following vaccination (Vaccination 1 in Cohort 1) (Day 1 through Day 10 or Day 7, where Day 1 was the day of vaccination) using an e-diary. This allowed recording of these assessments only within a fixed time window and provided an accurate representation of the participant’s experience at that time. AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs were collected during the study. In Cohort 1, AEs were collected from the signing of the informed consent document (ICD) through Visit 3. In Cohorts 2 and 3, AEs were collected from the signing of the ICD through Visit 2. For all participants, SAEs and NDCMCs were collected from the signing of the ICD until the final visit (approximately 6 months after Visit 1). An NDCMC was defined as a disease or medical condition, not previously identified, that was expected to be persis tent or was otherwise long-lasting in its effects. Acute reactions (immediate events) within the first 30 minutes after vaccination were assessed and documented as an AE or SAE. Statistical Methods: Immunogenicity Analysis: Hypothesis testing was performed to assess noninferiority by comparing the serotype-specific OPA titers 1 month after vaccination from the 20vPnC/saline group to those from the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group in Cohort 1, and comparing the serotype-specific OPA titers 1 month 20vPnC/saline group in Cohort 1 participants 60 through 64 years of age. Noninferiority for a serotype was to be declared if the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the serotype-specific OPA geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 20vPnC/saline relative to 13vPnC/PPSV23 (comparison in Cohort 1) or GMR of Cohort 2 (or Cohort 3) to Cohort 1 participants 60 through 64 years of age (bridging analysis) was greater than 0.5 (2-fold criterion). The serotype-specific OPA GMRs and associated 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference in least squares (LS) means and corresponding CIs estimated from analysis of log-transformed OPA titers using a linear regression model (primary approach). The linear regression model included terms of vaccine group, sex, smoking status, age at vaccination, and corresponding baseline OPA titers for comparison of 20vPnC/saline group to 13vPnC/PPSV23 group in Cohort 1, and included terms o f cohort, sex, smoking status, and corresponding baseline OPA titers for the bridging analysis comparing 20vPnC group from Cohort 2 (or Cohort 3) to Cohort 1 participants 60 through 64 years of age. Unadjusted serotype-specific OPA GMRs and associated 95% CIs were also calculated based on the t-distribution as a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the noninferiority evaluation. OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) and their 2-sided 95% CIs were obtained by calculating the means and 95% CIs on the natural log scale of OPA titers based on the t-distribution, and then exponentiating the mean and the confidence limits. OPA geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) and their 2-sided 95% CIs were obtained by dividing the indicated postbaseline titer by the baseline titer and log transforming the ratios, calculating the mean and 95% CIs based on the t-distribution, and then exponentiating the mean and the confidence limits Proportions (and 2-sided 95% CI) of participants with a ≥4-fold rise in serotype-specific OPA titer from before to 1 month after vaccination, and with serotype-specific OPA titers ≥ LLOQ were provided for each vaccine group. The associated 95% CI was obtained using the Clopper-Pearson method. Safety Analysis: All tolerability and safety results were summarized separately for each cohort. The 95% CI for each binary endpoint for each group was computed using the Clopper-Pearson method. The 95% CI for the between-group difference for each binary endpoint was calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 3009 participants were enrolled in Cohort 1, 2997 received 20vPnC or 13vPnC, and 2835 (94.2%) completed the study. There was a death of 1 participant due to a in the 20vPnC/saline group that was considered by the investigator to be not related to study vaccine. In Cohort 2, a total of 445 participants were enrolled and vaccinated, and 432 (97.1%) completed the study. In Cohort 3, a total of 448 participants were enrolled , 447 were vaccinated, and 423 (94.4%) completed the study. Disposition was similar in the vaccine groups within each cohort, and the most common reason for withdrawal was lost to follow-up. Demographic characteristics and smoking history for the safety population were similar in the vaccine groups within each cohort, with a relatively higher representation of female participants within each cohort. In Cohort 1, there was a goal to include older participants in this study, and 12.9% of participants were ≥70 years of age, making up nearly 40% of those ≥65 years of age. Overall, the distribution of race in Cohort 1 was representative of the US population of adults 60 years of age and older. Immunogenicity Results: 60 Years of Age and Older (Cohort 1) • The immune responses to the 13-matched vaccine serotypes induced by 20vPnC were noninferior to those induced by 13vPnC. • The immune responses to 6 of the 7 additional vaccine serotypes serotypes induced by 20vPnC were noninferior to those induced by PPSV23. • Serotype 8 narrowly missed the statistical noninferiority criterion 1 month after 20vPnC. However, the serotype 8 immune response is expected to be similarly protective as the 19 vaccine serotypes in 20vPnC that met noninferiority, based on OPA GMT, GMFR, proportion of participants with ≥4-fold rise in OPA titer, and proportion of participants with OPA titer ≥ LLOQ. • Robust immune responses to all 20 vaccine serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC were observed in adults ≥60 years of age, based on OPA GMTs, GMFRs, proportions of participants with ≥4-fold-rise in OPA titers, and proportions of participants with OPA titers ≥ LLOQ. 50 Through 59 Years of Age (Cohort 2) • The immune responses to the 20 vaccine serotypes induced by 20vPnC in adults 50 through 59 years of age were noninferior to those in adults 60 through 64 years of age. • Robust immune responses to all 20 vaccine serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC were observed in adults 50 through 59 years of age, based on OPA GMTs, GMFRs, proportions of participants with ≥4-fold-rise in OPA titers, and proportions of participants with OPA titers ≥ LLOQ. 18 Through 49 Years of Age (Cohort 3) • The immune responses to the 20 vaccine serotypes induced by 20vPnC in ad ults 18 through 49 years of age were noninferior to those in adults 60 through 64 years of age. • Robust immune responses to all 20 vaccine serotypes 1 month after 20vPnC were observed in adults 18 through 49 years of age, based on OPA GMTs, GMFRs, proportions of participants with ≥4-fold-rise in OPA titers, and proportions of participants with OPA titers ≥ LLOQ. Safety Results: • The proportions of participants who reported prompted local reactions and systemic events were similar in the 2 groups within each cohort. Most local reactions and systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. • Rates of AEs within 1 month after 20vPnC or 13vPnC were similar in the 2 groups within each cohort. No safety concerns were identified. • The proportions of participants reporting any SAEs were low (≤2.4% in Cohort 1, <1% in considered related to study vaccine by the investigator. There was 1 death due to a reported in the 20vPnC/saline group. • The proportions of participants who reported NDCMCs within 6 months after 20vPnC or 13vPnC were low (≤2.3% in Cohort 1, ≤1.5% in Cohort 2, ≤1.8% in Cohort 3), similar in the 2 groups within each cohort, and consistent with medical events that may occur in these populations. Conclusion(s): 20vPnC was observed to have a tolerability and safety profile similar to 13vPnC. Based on the robust immune responses and comparability to licensed pneumococcal vaccines (13vPnC and PPSV23) for applicable serotypes, as well as bridging to the younger age groups, these data support that 20vPnC will be protective against pneumococcal disease due to the 20 serotypes in adults.
