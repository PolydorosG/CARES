Study Initiation Date and Primary Completion or Final Completion Dates: Study Initiation Date: First subject first visit: 30 September 2014 Final Completion Date: Last subject last visit: 19 April 2018 Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objective(s): Primary Objective  To compare the efficacy of PF-05280586 to rituximab-EU when administered as a first-line treatment to subjects with CD20-positive, low tumor burden follicular lymphoma (LTB FL). Secondary Objectives  To evaluate the safety of PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU  To evaluate the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU  To evaluate the immunogenicity of PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU  To characterize CD19-positive B-cell depletion and recovery in subjects receiving PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU. METHODS Study Design: This was a double-blind, randomized, comparative clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK and immunogenicity of PF-05280586 versus rituximab-EU in stratified by low, medium, and high risk subjects using the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 2 (FLIPI2). During the study, subjects received 4 weekly doses of PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU administered via intravenous infusion. The dose of PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU was 375 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA). The maximum dose that could be infused in 1 day was 1125 mg. Figure 1. Study Schematic Abbreviations: EU=European Union; R-EU=rituximab-EU; R-Pfizer=rituximab-Pfizer (PF-05280586) Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): The primary hypothesis to be tested in this study was that the difference between the overall response rate (ORR) of PF-05280586 versus that of rituximab-EU was within a pre-specified equivalence margin of -16% to 16% (-14.9% to 14.9% for Japan). A sample size of approximately 394 subjects (approximately 197 per treatment arm) provided approximately 93% power for achieving equivalence under the specified margin with 2.5% type I error rate assuming an ORR of 77% in both treatment arms. Overall 394 subjects were enrolled globally (196 subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 198 subjects in the rituximab-EU group). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Male or female subjects aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed, Grade 1-3a, CD20-positive FL (containing no elements of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) were eligible for the study. Documentation of Ann Arbor Staging (II, III, or IV), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0 to 1, and at least 1 measureable disease lesion identifiable by imaging was also required for study eligibility. An eligible subject with LTB FL was defined as serum lactate dehydrogenase 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN), 2-microglobulin 1.5 × ULN, largest nodal or extra-nodal mass <7 cm in diameter, no more than 3 nodal sites with a diameter >3 cm, no clinically significant serous effusions detectible on chest radiography, spleen enlargement 16 cm by computed tomography scan, no complications such as organ compression or impairment, and no B symptoms (ie, fever >38C for 3 consecutive days; recurrent, drenching night sweats; unintentional weight loss exceeding 10% body weight in 6 months). Study Treatment: Blinded rituximab (PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU) was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22). The BSA for the subject was calculated using a standard formula and the subject’s weight and height. The weight and height at Screening could have been used to calculate the BSA for all doses unless the subject had a clinically significant change in weight from Screening at a dosing visit, in which case the dose could be adjusted if there had been a change of more than 10%. The maximum dose as per the product labeling; study treatment was administered according to the local product labeling if it differed from the following instructions:  Day 1 infusion: Infusion was initiated at a rate of 50 mg/hour. After 30 minutes and in the absence of infusion toxicity, infusion rate was increased by 50 mg/hour increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hour.  Day 8, 15, and 22 infusions: Infusion was initiated at a rate of 100 mg/hour. After 30 minutes and in the absence of infusion toxicity, the infusion rate was increased by 100 mg/hour increments at 30 minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/hour.  Subjects were closely monitored for the onset of cytokine release syndrome. Subjects who developed evidence of severe reactions, especially severe dyspnea, bronchospasm or hypoxia had immediate interruption of the infusion. In all subjects, the infusion was not to be restarted until complete resolution of all symptoms, and normalization of laboratory values. At this time, the infusion could be initially resumed at not more than one half the previous rate. If the same severe adverse reactions occurred for a second time, the decision to stop the treatment was seriously considered on a case by case basis.  Mild to moderate infusion related reactions (IRRs) usually respond to a reduction in the rate of infusion. The infusion rate could have been increased upon improvement of symptoms.  The subject was observed post-infusion if necessary based on the investigator’s medical judgment. Efficacy Evaluations: The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR at Week 26 of PF-05280586 versus rituximab-EU based on central review which included radiographic assessment and review of clinical data (B-cell depletion and bone marrow biopsy results). As per current guidelines for staging and response assessment of lymphoma, the ORR was defined purely for the purpose of this study as the proportion of subjects who achieved either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). This updated terminology has been used throughout and is based on the Lugano Classification, the most current response assessment guidelines for malignant lymphoma. Secondary efficacy evaluations included:  Time to treatment failure (TTF) defined as the time from date of randomization to progression of disease (PD) based on central review, death due to any cause, or permanent discontinuation from treatment, or discontinuation from study for any reason, whichever came first.  Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from date of randomization to first PD (based on central review) or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD. lymphoma (based on central review).  Duration of response (DOR) defined as the time from date of the first documentation of overall response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of PD (central review) or to death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD.  Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause. Immunogenicity, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Evaluations Serum samples for detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were collected within 4 hours prior to dose administration on Day 1 and Day 15. Additional samples for detection of ADA and NAb were collected at Weeks 5 (Day 29), 13, 26, 39, and 52. Human serum ADA samples were analyzed using 2 validated, semi-quantitative electrochemiluminescent ADA assay methods. Human serum samples testing positive for the presence of ADA were required to be analyzed for the presence or absence of neutralizing anti-rituximab antibody and neutralizing anti-PF-05280586 antibody using 2 semi-quantitative NAb cell-based assays. Both assays used a tiered approach using screening, confirmation and titer/quantitation. The cross-reactivity sample analysis was done for those study samples that tested positive in the assay for the administered study drug using the alternate assay with titration and confirmatory analysis. For the immunogenicity data, the percentage of subjects with positive ADA and NAb was summarized for each treatment and by visit. For subjects with positive ADA, the magnitude (titer), of ADA response was also described. In addition, possible associations of ADA response with clinical data on the PK, and safety were examined. On days where study drug was administered (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22), serum samples for measurement of drug concentrations were collected prior to dose administration (within 4 hours of the start of dosing). On Days 1 and 22, additional drug concentration samples were collected within 15 minutes prior to the end of infusion. Additionally, drug concentration samples were collected at Weeks 5 (Day 29), 13, 26, 39 and 52. Rituximab samples were assayed using a validated, sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum specimens were stored at approximately -70C until assay. The serum concentration-time data were summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment. The pharmacodynamics of PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU was evaluated using circulating CD19-positive B-cell counts (surrogate marker for CD20+ B-cells). Rituximab is known to deplete B-cells, which can result in a decrease in circulating levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG. Blood samples for assessment of circulating CD19 positive B-cell counts, and IgM and IgG were collected at Day 1 (Visit 2), Treatment Visits (Visits 3, 4, and 5: Study Days 8, 15, and 22), Follow-up Visits (Visits 6, 7, 8, and 9: Weeks 5, 13, 26, and 39), and the End of Study/Early Termination Visit (Visit 10, Week 52). Blood samples were assayed for CD19+ B-cell counts by laser scanning cytometry. Summary statistics by treatment and visit were seriousness, and relationship to study treatment of adverse events (AEs), including neutropenia, infections, IRRs, and other clinical outcomes associated with immunogenicity (hereafter referred to as immune-based adverse effects; events relating to Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Queries of Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity reactions, and events meeting Sampson’s criteria), and laboratory abnormalities. Statistical Methods: The primary efficacy analysis for equivalence was performed after all randomized subjects had the opportunity to complete their Week 26 visit and the assessment of overall response. Analyses were performed with the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population defined as all subjects who were randomized. The same analysis based on the Per Protocol (PP) Population, defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment (PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU) as planned, had adequate disease assessment at baseline as confirmed by central review, and had no important protocol deviations that would impact the efficacy assessments significantly, was performed as a sensitivity analysis. Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) for CR, PR, and ORR were presented by treatment group and visit. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of these response rates within each group, and the 95% CI of the difference in the response rates between the 2 treatment groups was constructed. The estimated difference in response rate between PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU was computed (based on the stratified Mantel-Haenszel method) and the asymptotic 95% CI of the difference, as proposed by Miettinen and Nurminen (published in 1985) was constructed. The FLIPI2 categorization (low, medium, and high) was considered as the stratification factor in the Mantel-Haenszel (for the estimated treatment difference) and Miettinen and Nurminen (for the 95% CI) methods. Progression-free survival was defined as the time from date of randomization to first PD or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD and was censored as summarized in Table 1: Table 1. Handling of Missing Assessments and Censoring Rules for PFS Analysis Situation Date of Progression or Censoring Outcome No baseline or no adequate Date of Randomization Censored baseline assessment, and no death No post-baseline or no adequate Date of Randomization Censored post-baseline assessment, and no deathNo death or disease progression Date of last adequate assessment Censored Discontinued from study Date of last adequate assessment Censored Disease progression or death Date of death or first adequate Progressed (event) assessment for progression, whichever was earlier The censoring mechanisms for TTF and DOR were similar to those described for PFS above with the exception that for TTF permanent discontinuation from treatment or discontinuation the endpoint was censored at the time of the last adequate assessment where CR or PR was declared. A log-rank test stratified by FLIPI2 risk was used to compare the treatment groups with respect to the secondary endpoints of PFS, OR, TTF and DOR at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. Secondary endpoints were also summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Kaplan-Meier 1-year estimates and the 2-sided 95% CI of the rates using the Greenwood’s formula were reported. In addition, a Cox model stratified by FLIPI2 was used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 95% CI for the treatment effect. The primary efficacy endpoint (ORR at Week 26) was also analyzed within subgroups of interest, to evaluate consistency of results relative to overall results. The analysis for DOR was based on central review assessment and the Response Evaluable Population, defined as all subjects in the ITT Population who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had adequate disease assessment at baseline, and at least 1 post-baseline response assessment. The safety analyses (including ADA and NAb analyses) were carried out using the Safety Population, defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Safety data were described using descriptive statistics. Frequency and percentage of subjects within each treatment group, risk difference, p-value, and 95% CI of risk difference were provided for Tier-1 AEs (pre-specified events considered of potentially clinical importance) and Tier-2 AEs (those events that occurred in at least 6 subjects in either treatment group and were not Tier-1). Individual signs and symptoms of IRRs were documented on the electronic case report form in addition to the preferred term (PT) of “infusion related reaction” for the purpose of comparing the overall percentage of subjects by treatment arm. The reporting of these events and timing of events in relation to the infusion were determined by the investigator. All IRRs, potential allergic and anaphylactic reactions based on Sampson criteria were summarized overall, by treatment group and by ADA status. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A summary of subject disposition is provided in Table 2. There were 394 subjects assigned to the double-blind treatment; 196 subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 198 subjects in the rituximab-EU group. Of these, 393 subjects were actively treated including 196 treated subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 197 treated subjects in the rituximab-EU group. There was 1 subject who was assigned to the rituximab-EU group who withdrew from the study prior to receiving treatment. Of the 393 subjects actively treated, 390 subjects had completed protocol-specified therapy. They received 4 doses of study treatment given on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (194 [99.0%] subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 196 [99.0%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group). In total, 340 subjects had completed Week 52 (End of Study) of the study (170 [86.7%] (394 [100.0%] subjects) was used for the efficacy analysis, and the Safety Population (393 [99.7%] subjects) was used for the analyses of AEs (393 [99.7%] subjects) and laboratory data (392 [99.5%] subjects), including ADA and NAb analyses. The PP Population (342 [86.8%] subjects) was used for sensitivity analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The modified ITT Population (393 [99.7%] subjects) was used for the biomarker analyses. The Response Evaluable Population (388 [98.5%] subjects) was used for the analysis of DOR. The PK Population (393 [99.7%] subjects), defined as subjects who were treated with PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU and provided at least 1 post-dose drug concentration measurement, was used for analysis of the PK endpoints. The percentage of subjects in each population was comparable between treatment groups. Table 2.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Time to Treatment Failure (TTF): A total of 142 (72.4%) ITT subjects in the PF-05280586 and 150 (75.8%) subjects in the rituximab-EU treatment groups were censored (Table 5). The main reason for censorship was ‘study completion without treatment failure’ for subjects in the PF-05280586 treatment group (139 [97.9%] subjects and 149 [99.3%] subjects in the PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU treatment groups, respectively). Using a Cox Proportional Hazards model with FLIPI2 categorization (low, medium, and high) as strata, the hazard ratio for TTF for PF-05280586 versus rituximab-EU was 1.163, with a 95% CI of (0.786, 1.720). The stratified log-rank test resulted in a 2-sided p-value of 0.450.

Overall Survival (OS): In the ITT Population, there was 1 (<1.0%) subject who died in each treatment group. The cause of death for both subjects was disease progression. As there were very few deaths during the reporting period the Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS by treatment group for subjects in the ITT Population these data are of limited value and were not interpreted. by visit is provided for subjects in the PK Population in Table 9. On days where study drug was administered (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22), serum samples for measurement of drug concentrations were collected prior to dose administration (within 4 hours of the start of dosing). On Days 1 and 22, additional drug concentration samples were collected within 15 minutes prior to the end of infusion. Additionally, drug concentration samples were collected at Weeks 5 (Day 29), 13, 26, 39, and 52 (hours not specified). In general, data indicated similar rituximab serum concentrations at each visit between the 2 treatment groups. The highest (peak) serum concentration (mean [SD]) was observed at Day 22, within 15 minutes prior to the end of the infusion, and were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. At visits following completion of study treatment, serum concentrations decreased steadily from Week 5 to Week 52 (End of Study; Table 9) and were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. Table 9.

End of Treatment/End of Study from 0.6 to 2313.1 cells/L across the 2 treatment groups. The median baseline CD19-positive B-cell count was 119.9 cells/L in the PF-05280586 group and 114.2 cells/L in the rituximab-EU group. A decrease from baseline in mean serum CD19-positive B-cell counts was observed at all subsequent time points through Week 26, and was comparable between both treatment groups. The median percentage reduction from baseline at Week 2 was >99% for subjects in both the PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU groups. CD19-positive B-cells showed recovery at Week 39 in both treatment groups, the increase in cell count continued through End of Study (Week 52). Mean (SD) serum IgG concentrations were comparable between the 2 treatment groups at baseline (10.43 [3.137] G/L in the PF-05280586 group and 10.73 [2.642] G/L in the rituximab-EU group). A small decrease from baseline in median serum IgG concentrations was observed at all subsequent time points, and was comparable between both treatment groups. The greatest median percentage change from baseline was observed at Week 4 in both treatment groups (median percent change of -4.31% for subjects in the PF-05280586 group and -5.54% in the rituximab-EU group). Mean (SD) serum IgM concentrations were comparable between the 2 treatment groups at baseline (1.06 [1.381] G/L in the PF-05280586 group and 0.99 [0.646] G/L in the rituximab-EU group). In general, mean serum IgM concentrations decreased throughout the duration of the study and were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. The greatest median percentage change from baseline was observed at Week 52 (End of Study; median percent change of 24.00% for subjects in the PF-05280586 group and -21.00% in the rituximab-EU group). Immunogenicity: A summary of ADA incidence by visit and overall is presented in Table 10. For subjects in the Safety Population, there were 14 (7.2%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 17 (8.7%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group who had a positive ADA test (titer 1.88) prior to initiation of study drug at baseline (Day 1). One (0.5%) subject in the PF 05280586 group and 2 (1.0%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group had a positive ADA test pre-dose on Day 15. Following initiation of treatment, the percentage of subjects with ADA increased over the duration of the study from Week 5 through Week 52 (End of Study), and was similar between treatments. Overall, there were 43 (22.1%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 39 (19.8%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group with at least 1 post-dose sample that tested positive for ADA. In general, of the samples that tested positive for ADA, the majority tested positive in both ADA assays, indicating that the ADA that developed was against shared epitopes between the study treatments with 40/43 (93.0%) subjects with positive ADA cross-reactivity in the PF-05280586 group, and 30/39 (76.9%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group. A titer booster response (an increase in titer upon repeated treatment) was not observed. automatically assigned a negative NAb test result. In this study, all ADA positive samples tested negative for NAb. Table 10.

Overall, the percentage of subjects reporting immune-based adverse effects post-treatment was comparable between treatment groups, and also between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects. The percentage of treatment-emergent IRR AEs (all causalities) was comparable between the treatment groups with 49 (25.0%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 59 (29.9%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group with reported IRRs. The incidence of treatment-emergent (all causalities) anaphylactic reaction/hypersensitivity AEs was comparable between the treatment groups. Overall, there were 39 (19.9%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 48 (24.4%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group with an event meeting the broad and narrow SMQ of Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity. Overall, there were 17 (8.7%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 17 (8.6%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group with an event potentially meeting Sampson criteria. Medical review of events utilizing Sampson criteria did not identify any subject meeting the criteria of anaphylaxis as described in the Second Symposium on the Definition of Anaphylaxis. The percentage of IRRs (as assessed by the investigator), events retrieved utilizing the SMQ of Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity (broad and narrow), and events potentially meeting the Sampson Criteria occurring in ADA positive subjects was comparable between the treatment groups:  In the PF-05280586 group: 11/43 (25.6%) subjects with IRRs, 7/43 (16.3%) subjects with events of Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity (broad and narrow), and 5/43 (11.6%) subjects with events potentially meeting the Sampson Criteria.  In the rituximab-EU group: 10/39 (25.6%) subjects with IRRs, 5/39 (12.8%) subjects with events of Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity (broad and narrow), and 4/39 (10.3%) subjects with events potentially meeting the Sampson Criteria.

Standardized MedDRA Query from the MedDRA dictionary (v20.1). Discontinuations: The number of TEAEs leading to withdrawal from the study are summarized in Table 14. There were 2 (1.0%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group who permanently discontinued from the study due to treatment-related AEs. In total, there were 27 (13.6%) subjects who discontinued from the study in the PF-05280586 group and 23 (11.7%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was progressive disease (14 [7.1%] subjects and 20 [10.1%] subjects in the PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU groups, respectively). There were 3 (1.5%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 1 (0.5%) subject in the rituximab-EU group who permanently discontinued from the study due to TEAEs (infusion related reaction and angioedema, rash maculo-papular, and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in the PF-05280586 group; and Grade 2 bladder cancer in the rituximab-EU group). rituximab-EU PF-05280586 n (%) n (%) Number of subjects 198 196 Completed 170 (85.9) 170 (86.7) Discontinuations:Relation to study drug not defined 27 (13.6) 23 (11.7) Insufficient clinical response 4 (2.0) 3 (1.5) Lost to follow-up 0 1 (0.5) No longer willing to participate in study 3 (1.5) 4 (2.0) Progressive disease 20 (10.1) 14 (7.1) Protocol violation 0 1 (0.5) Related to study drug 0 2 (1.0) Adverse event, not serious 0 2 (1.0) Not related to study drug 1 (0.5) 1 (0.5) Adverse event, not serious 0 1 (0.5) Adverse event, serious non-fatal 1 (0.5) 0 Total 28 (14.1) 26 (13.3) Abbreviations: EU=European Union; n=number of subjects in this reporting group.

CONCLUSION(S):  Equivalence between PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU was statistically demonstrated in the ITT Population for the primary efficacy endpoint, ORR. The analysis of ORR at Week 26 derived from central review assessments showed an estimated difference of 4.66% (PF-05280586 minus rituximab-EU), with a 95% CI of (-4.16%, 13.47%), which fell entirely within the -16.0% to 16.0% pre-specified equivalence margin agreed to by the FDA and EMA, and also within the -14.9% to 14.9% margin agreed to by the PMDA.  There were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant differences in the secondary endpoint results for CR rate at Week 26, PFS, OS, and TTF, which were comparable between the 2 treatment groups, in the ITT Population. There were also no clinically meaningful or statistically significant differences in the secondary endpoint of DOR in the Response Evaluable Population.  A comparable safety profile was observed between the treatment groups and with the safety information described in the reference product label.  The observed rate of ADA was comparable between the 2 treatment groups. A titer booster response (an increase in titer upon repeated treatment) was not observed. No ADA positive subjects tested positive for NAb.  The serum concentrations of PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU groups were comparable. ADA positive and ADA negative subjects in either treatment group.  CD19 positive B-cell depletion and recovery were comparable between the treatment groups and consistent with the reference product label.  No clinically meaningful differences were observed in terms of potential immunogenicity associated AEs in those who were treatment-emergent ADA positive versus those who were ADA negative.
