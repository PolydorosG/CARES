Adapted from protocol to reflect actual analyses in Part 1 of the study. NOTE: For all non-PK related endpoints in Part 1, baseline was defined as the time-matched data obtained while on placebo, unless otherwise specified. METHODS Study Design: The study was initially planned as a 3-part design with investigator- and participant-blinded (sponsor-open), placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-escalation evaluating single, escalating oral doses (in Part 1) and multiple, repeated oral doses (in Part 2); and a randomized, open-label design evaluating the effect of food on PF-07202954 exposures (in Part 3). Only Part 1 of the study was conducted; the study was concluded at the end of Part 1. A total of up to 16 unique participants were planned to be randomized in Part 1 of this study. The study design schema of Part 1 is presented in Figure S1. Figure S1. Study Schema - Part 1 of C4171001 Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Participants were healthy males and females who were 18 to 55 years of age at the time of signing the Informed Consent Document (ICD) with a body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2 and a total body weight >50 kg (110 lb). Study Treatment: In Part 1 of the study, following an overnight fast of ≥10 hours, participants were to receive the study intervention with a standard morning meal at approximately 0800 hours (±2 hours). PF-07202954/placebo was administered with a standard meal in Periods 1, 2, and 3, in both cohorts. In Period 4, participants in Cohort 1 received PF-07202954/placebo with high-fat/high-calorie meal, and participants in Cohort 2 received PF-07202954/placebo in the fasted state. Cohort 1 was exposed to PF-07202954/placebo doses of 10 mg (Period 1), 100 mg (Period 2), 600 mg (Period 3), and 100 mg with a high-fat/high-calorie meal 300 mg (Period 2), 100 mg (Period 3), and 100 mg in fasted state (Period 4). Results from periods during which PF-07202954 100 mg was administered with a standard meal were combined (C1+C2 combined) in summary statistics and tabular/graphic presentations. Information of the study interventions are provided in Table S2. Table S2. Study Intervention Description - Part 1 of C4171001 Efficacy Evaluations: Not Applicable Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Blood samples (4 mL) to provide sufficient plasma were collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing K EDTA. Plasma samples were 2 analyzed for concentrations of PF-07202954 using a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures (SOPs). Evaluation of Exploratory Marker of Clinical Activity (PCSK9): Blood samples to provide sufficient plasma were collected. K EDTA plasma samples were analyzed for total 2 PCSK9 concentrations using a validated electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay in compliance with Pfizer SOPs. Serial assessments of PCSK9 were conducted prior to dosing and over 24-hour interval to permit assessment of weighted mean response on AUEC /24. 24 Exploratory Genetic Evaluations: A single blood sample (4 mL in K EDTA) was 2 collected. DNA samples were extracted for genotyping in order to assess the impact of allelic variants of ABCG2 (encodes for breast cancer resistance protein [BCRP]), PNPLA3, and HSD17B13. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included AEs, vital signs measurements, ECG assessments, and clinical safety laboratory tests. Additional exploratory biomarkers of kidney safety (urinary composite measure, Clusterin, CysC, KIM1, NAG, NGAL, Osteopontin) were also evaluated and are presented in this Synopsis. Statistical Methods: PK, safety and clinical activity marker data were descriptively summarized and presented in tabular and/or graphical format as appropriate. Geometric mean ratio relative to placebo for the urinary composite measure at different PF-07202954 dose levels was compared to the threshold T at 5% probability listed in Kidney Safety Composite Measure Biomarker approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA). RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 12 participants were randomized to Cohort 1 (N=6) and Cohort 2 (N=6). Among 12 randomized participants, 11 received both PF-07202954 and placebo, and 1 participant in Cohort 2 was exposed to PF-07202954 alone.  Among 6 participants in Cohort 1, all 6 participants received placebo, 4 received PF-07202954 10 mg with a standard meal, 5 received PF-07202954 100 mg with a standard meal, 4 received PF-07202954 600 mg with a standard meal, and 5 received PF-07202954 100 mg with a high-fat/high-calorie meal.  Among 6 participants in Cohort 2, 5 participants received placebo, 4 received PF-07202954 30 mg with a standard meal, 5 received PF-07202954 300 mg with a standard meal, 4 received PF-07202954 100 mg with a standard meal, and 2 received PF-07202954 100 mg fasted. All 6 participants in Cohort 1 and 3 out of 6 participants in Cohort 2 received their assigned 4 doses and completed the study. The other 3 participants in Cohort 2 prematurely withdrew from the study for reasons other than an AE after dosing in less than the planned 4 periods. The majority of participants (75.0%) were male. The majority of participants (91.7%) were Black or African American. Median age was 32.0 years. Over half of the participants (58.3%) were 26 - 35 years of age. Median weight and BMI at baseline were 77.43 kg and 25.55 kg/m2, respectively. Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done. Pharmacokinetic Results: PF-07202954 Plasma PK Profile Following administration of single oral doses of PF-07202954 with a standard meal to healthy adult participants, PF-07202954 was absorbed with median T values between 0.75 max to 3 hours across all dose levels. Mean terminal t values ranged from 5.615 hours to 14.81 ½ hours across all dose levels administered with a standard meal. In general, plasma AUC , AUC , and C increased with increasing dose in an inf last max approximate dose-proportional manner from 10 to 300 mg. There was a potential trend of slightly greater than dose-proportional exposure increase from 300 mg to 600 mg. Inter-participant variability within a cohort was low to moderate based on geometric percent coefficient of variation (%CV) ranging from 13% to 30%, 13% to 29%, and 20% to 66% for AUC , AUC , and C , respectively, across the PF-07202954 dose range evaluated. last inf max High-Fat/High Calorie Meal PK or Fasted PK versus Standard Meal PK Four participants in Cohort 1 were administered PF-07202954 100 mg with a high-fat/high-calorie meal (test; Cohort 1 Period 4) and a standard meal (reference; Cohort 1 Period 2). Plasma exposures were similar following both treatments. Test/Reference ratios of adjusted geometric means (90% confidence interval [CI]) for AUC , AUC , and C inf last max were 101.49% (78.15%, 131.79%), 101.41% (78.25%, 131.43%), and 94.46% (74.99%, 118.99%), respectively. Two participants in Cohort 2 were administered PF-07202954 100 mg under fasting conditions (test; Cohort 2 Period 4) and a standard meal (reference; Cohort 2 Period 3). Plasma exposures were similar following both treatments in these 2 participants with individual Test/Reference ratios of 117% and 98% for AUC , 118% and 101% for AUC , inf last and 107% and 113% for Cmax. Exploratory Genetic Results: A total of 6 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in this study. Across the 12 participants randomized, numbers of participants with each genotyped SNP are summarized below: Exploratory Marker of Clinical Activity (Plasma PCSK9) Results: Median plasma PCSK9 AUEC /24 decreased relative to placebo with each dose of 24 PF-07202954, with the 80% CI for percent change from placebo not including 0 for all dosing regimens except for PF-07202954 doses of 10 mg and 600 mg administered with a standard meal. No clear dose dependence was observed with increasing doses of PF-07202954. Safety Results: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Following administration of single, oral doses of PF-07202954, the proportion of participants reporting at least 1 TEAE was numerically lower (20.0% - 25.0%) compared to the placebo group (27.3%). No apparent dose-related trend in the frequency of TEAEs was observed with increasing doses of PF-07202954, with no TEAEs reported with PF-07202954 doses of 10 mg and 600 mg administered with a standard meal and 100 mg administered following an overnight fast. None of the TEAEs were treatment-related. All TEAEs were mild. No death, serious adverse events (SAEs), severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation from study or study intervention, or TEAEs leading to dose reduction occurred in this study. Laboratory The majority of participants (5 out of 6 in each Cohort) had laboratory test abnormalities. None of the laboratory abnormalities were considered clinically significant or reported as AEs by the investigator. Vital Signs None of the 3 isolated occurrences of vital signs that met predefined criteria for categorization were reported as TEAEs. Two of these occurrences followed placebo administration and the other occurrence followed PF-07202954 administration. ECG No participant had cardiac conduction intervals (PR, QRS or QTcF) that met the pre-specified criteria or considered clinically significant. Exploratory Biomarkers of Kidney Safety (Urinary Composite Measure, Clusterin, Cystatin C, KIM1, NAG, NGAL, and Osteopontin) Geometric mean increase of approximately 30% compared to placebo was observed for the urinary composite measure at the higher doses of 100 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg. Similar suggestive signals were observed albeit inconsistently for the 6 component urinary biomarkers, mostly at higher doses. The geometric mean ratio relative to placebo for the urinary composite measure at PF-07202954 doses of 100 mg and higher were 1.24 or higher. These changes, despite the limited sample size per dose, are unlikely to be random, and suggest an increased likelihood of a renal injury response with repeated dosing as interpreted using US FDA Kidney Safety Composite Measure Biomarker. Conclusions: PF-07202954 was found to be well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile following single oral doses up to 600 mg administered to healthy adults. Following administration of single oral PF-07202954 doses of 10 to 600 mg to healthy adult participants, PF‑07202954 had median T values between 0.75 to 3 hours across all dose max levels, and mean terminal t values from 5.615 hours to 14.81 hours across all dose levels ½ administered with a standard meal. Plasma exposures increased in an approximate dose-proportional manner from 10 to 300 mg, with a potential trend of slightly greater than dose-proportional exposure increase from 300 mg to 600 mg. Median plasma PCSK9 AUEC /24 decreased relative to placebo with each dose of 24 PF-07202954, though without evidence of a dose response with increasing doses of PF-07202954. Evaluation of urinary kidney safety biomarkers following single, oral, dose administration of PF-07202954 suggested potential for increased likelihood of a renal injury response. PF-07202954 plasma exposures were generally similar when dosing PF-07202954 100 mg with a standard meal (n=9), high-fat/high-calorie meal (n=5), or in the fasted state (n=2).
