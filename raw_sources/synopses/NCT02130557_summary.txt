Automated complete blood count (CBC), differential counts (with manual confirmation of abnormalities), bone marrow differential, molecular analysis for BCR-ABL transcripts, cytogenetics, physical examination, and mortality were used to determine the response to treatment. Molecular response monitoring using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for BCR-ABL copy number was performed on peripheral blood on all patients harboring b2a2 and/or b3a2 transcripts. Blood samples were sent to a central vendor for analysis and assessment using the international scale. Differential counts and cytogenetic assessment on bone marrow aspirate were performed locally. Safety Evaluations: Safety was assessed by physical examinations, vital signs, AEs, laboratory test measurements, ECGs and echocardiogram and/or MUGA scans. Based on clinical experience with bosutinib and other TKIs, certain categories of AESI were selected for further analysis. These categories included cardiac, hemorrhage, effusion, edema, myelosuppression, liver function, infection, rash, hypersensitivity, gastrointestinal, vascular, hypertension, and renal AEs. Statistical Methods: The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized patients with study drug assignment designated according to initial randomization. All efficacy analyses were based on the mITT population (mITT excluded 12 Ph- CP CML patients [ie, 0 out of ≥10-99 metaphases at baseline; 6 in each arm], 29 patients with unknown Ph status (13 bosutinib and 16 imatinib), 6 patients with atypical transcripts (3 in each arm), and 2 imatinib patients with atypical transcripts and unknown Ph status from the ITT population), with the exception of the duration of response and selected endpoints. All endpoints were also evaluated on the ITT population except for cytogenetic endpoints which were evaluated in the mITT population only. The safety population included all patients regardless of Philadelphia chromosome status, who received at least 1 dose of study medication with treatment assignments designated to actual study treatment received. Given the primary endpoint analysis was significant, each endpoint of the short-term family was to be tested via the Bonferroni’s procedure at the 1-sided 0.0125 significance level. CCyR by 12 months was significant at the time of the primary endpoint analysis. If either MMR by 18 months or CCyR by 12 months in the short-term family was significant, the long-term family was to be tested via the Holm stepwise test. The long-term family (EFS, OS) was to be tested at either the 1-sided 0.025 alpha (if both CCyR by 12 months and MMR by 18 months were significant at 0.0125) or the 1-sided 0.0125 (if only one of the two endpoints was significant at 0.0125). This approach to multiple testing was to strongly control the overall type 1 error rate at the 1-sided 0.025 significance level. All family wise comparisons were to be based on the mITT population. No additional adjustment for multiple comparisons was made. The 95% CI for odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) for the treatment effect (bosutinib vs imatinib) which excluded 1 were considered predictive of outcome. Ratios <1 for duration of response, EFS, transformation, and OS; and ratios >1 for response and time to response were considered to favor bosutinib. All safety variables were summarized using the safety population. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: The ITT population included 536 randomized patients with 268 in the bosutinib arm and 268 in the imatinib arm. In the ITT population, 232 (86.6%) patients in the bosutinib arm and 231 (86.2%) in the imatinib arm completed the study. The safety population included 268 patients in the bosutinib arm and 265 patients in the imatinib arm. The number of patients who were still on treatment at 5 years was similar for both treatment arms (160 [59.7%] in the bosutinib arm and 154 [58.1%] in the imatinib arm). In the safety population, the most common reason for permanent treatment discontinuation was AEs in the bosutinib arm (25.0% with bosutinib vs 12.5% with imatinib) and lack of efficacy (disease progression or suboptimal response/treatment failure) in the imatinib arm (5.6% with bosutinib vs 17.7% with imatinib). Only 1 bosutinib patient discontinued from the treatment and the study early due to COVID-19. Of the 536 patients in the ITT population, 487 (90.9%) patients were included in the mITT population with 246 patients in the bosutinib arm and 241 patients in the imatinib arm.

Covance CSR/Programs/Tables/t_disp.sas Data Table ITT Completed Discontinued Reasons mITT Completed Discontinued Reasons Note: a. b. Covance CSR/Programs/Tables/t_disc_reas.sas Data In the ITT population, the demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced in both treatment arms. Most of the patients were white (77.8%) and under 65 years of age (81.2%), 21.1% of patients had a high Sokal risk at screening, most patients were Ph+ (92.0%) and 98.5% of patients had “typical” (b2a2 and/or b3a2) BCR-ABL transcripts, most patients (95.9%) had no extramedullary disease. Impact of COVID-19 on the Study Results A limited number of patients (33/533 [6.2%]) were still on treatment or in long term follow-up at the time the pandemic was declared on 11 March 2020. After this date, certain protocol-specific EOT assessments were missed in a few patients (8 patients had a missed efficacy assessment and 7 patients had missed safety laboratory assessments and/or safety procedures) due to COVID-19. However, given the small number of patients involved, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the study efficacy and safety assessments was minimal. Efficacy Results: Secondary Endpoint Results MMR by Month 18 The proportion of patients with MMR by Month 18 in the mITT population was not statistically significantly higher in the bosutinib arm compared to the imatinib arm at the pre-specified 1-sided 0.0125 level (OR: 1.42 [95% CI: 0.99, 2.04], 1-sided p=0.0303). The rate of MMR by Month 18 was 61.0% (95% CI: 54.9%, 67.1%) with bosutinib and 52.7% (95% CI: 46.4%, 59.0%) with imatinib. MMR by Month 18 in the ITT population was higher in the bosutinib arm compared to the imatinib arm (60.8% vs 51.5%, respectively; OR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.08). Duration of MMR Of the 182 (74.0%) patients in the bosutinib arm and 158 (65.6%) patients in the imatinib arm that achieved MMR by Month 60 in the mITT population, a total of 24 patients (13 [7.1%] patients in the bosutinib arm and 11 [7.0%] patients in the imatinib arm) had confirmed loss of MMR and the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) rate at Year 4 was 92.2% (95% CI: 86.8%, 95.4%) and 92.0% (95% CI: 85.9%, 95.5%) for the bosutinib and imatinib arms, respectively. The duration of MMR was not different between the treatment arms (HR: 1.09 [95% CI: 0.49, 2.44]). Results were similar in the ITT Population. Duration of CCyR Of the 205 (83.3%) patients in the bosutinib arm and 185 (76.8%) patients in the imatinib arm that achieved CCyR by Month 60 in the mITT population, a total of 16 patients (5 [2.4%] patients in the bosutinib arm and 11 [5.9%] patients in the imatinib arm) had confirmed loss of CCyR and the K-M rate at Year 4 was 97.4% (95% CI: 93.9%, 98.9%) and 93.7% (95% CI: 88.9%, 96.5%) for the bosutinib and imatinib arms, respectively. The duration of CCyR was not different between the treatment arms (HR: 0.39 [95% CI: 0.14, 1.13]). Event-Free Survival The on-treatment EFS in the mITT population (HR: 0.64 [95% CI: 0.35, 1.17] with 1-sided p=0.0749) was not statistically different between treatment arms at the pre-specified 1-sided 0.0125 level. The cumulative incidence of EFS events at Month 60 was 6.9% (95% CI: 4.2%, 10.5%) in the bosutinib arm and 10.4% (95% CI: 6.9%, 14.6%) in the imatinib arm. As expected for a first-line (1L) CP CML population, relatively few on-treatment events were observed for this Month 60 follow-up. Although the curves were not statistically significantly different, there were fewer EFS events in the bosutinib arm compared to the imatinib arm (17 [6.9%] with bosutinib and 25 [10.4%] with imatinib); events that occurred with bosutinib vs imatinib were death (3 vs 4), transformation to AP/BP (6 vs 7), doubling of WBC count without CHR (3 vs 0), confirmed loss of CCyR (5 vs 11), and confirmed loss of CHR (4 vs 8). Results were similar in the ITT population with no Ph- or unknown Ph status patients experiencing loss of ≤1% transcripts. Overall Survival An OS benefit was not observed in the mITT population (HR: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.37, 1.73]). Due to the pre-specified hierarchical testing strategy, OS was not tested since EFS was not statistically significant. As expected for a 1L CP CML population, there were few on-study deaths at the Month 60 follow-up, 12 in the bosutinib arm and 14 in the imatinib arm. High rates were observed in both arms, OS at Month 60 was 94.9% (95% CI: 91.1%, 97.0%) in the bosutinib arm and 94.0% (95% CI: 90.1%, 96.4%) in the imatinib arm. There were 2 additional deaths in the bosutinib arm in the ITT population and the results were similar. The median (range) duration of follow-up was 55.23 (0.4-59.2) months for patients in the bosutinib arm and 55.23 (1.7-59.3) months for patients in the imatinib arm. Exploratory Endpoint Results MMR at Month 18 The proportion of patients with MMR at Month 18 in the mITT population was higher in the bosutinib arm compared to the imatinib arm, 56.9% (95% CI: 50.7, 63.1) vs 47.7% (95% CI: 41.4, 54.0), respectively; OR: 1.45 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.07). Results were similar in the ITT population. Time to MMR Responses occurred earlier in the bosutinib arm, the cumulative incidence of MMR was higher for bosutinib vs imatinib in the mITT population (HR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.08, 1.63]). The imatinib arm (36.1 weeks [range: 11.9-241.9] vs 47.7 weeks [range: 12.1-216.1]). Results were similar in the ITT population. Time to MR4 and MR4.5 Deep molecular responses were achieved earlier in the bosutinib arm. The cumulative incidence of MR4 and MR4.5 were higher for bosutinib vs imatinib in the mITT population (HR; 1.32 [95% CI: 1.04,1.68] and HR: 1.38 [95% CI: 1.06,1.81], respectively). Among responders, the median time to MR4 was similar in the bosutinib and imatinib arms (83.7 weeks [range: 12.4-244.3] vs 84.4 weeks [range: 23.6-241.9]) and shorter in the bosutinib arm than in the imatinib arm for MR4.5 (108.0 weeks [range: 24.1-242.1] vs 120.4 weeks [range: 24.6-240.7]). Results were similar in the ITT population. Time to CCyR Responses occurred earlier in the bosutinib arm, the cumulative incidence of CCyR was higher for bosutinib vs imatinib in the mITT population (HR: 1.35 [95% CI: 1.11, 1.64]). The median time to CCyR in responders was similar in the bosutinib and imatinib arms (24.0 weeks [range: 11.4-120.7] vs 24.3 weeks [range: 11.4-96.6]). Time to On-Treatment Transformation to AP and BP The rate of on-treatment transformation from CP CML to AP or BP CML was low in the mITT population. A total of 6 (2.4%) patients progressed to AP/BP in the bosutinib arm compared to 7 (2.9%) in the imatinib arm. The cumulative incidence of progression to AP/BP was similar in the bosutinib and imatinib arms (HR: 0.84 [95% CI: 0.29, 2.45]). There were no new transformations after the Month 24 follow-up. No additional transformations occurred, and the results were similar in the ITT population. Type of BCR-ABL Mutations Present at Treatment Completion/Discontinuation or Suboptimal Response Fewer patients had newly detectable mutations in the bosutinib arm than in the imatinib arm, 6 (2.4%) and 12 (5.0%), respectively in the mITT population. The spectrum of observed mutations was narrower for bosutinib compared to imatinib, with 2 vs 9 different amino acids affected, respectively. There were 5 patients who exhibited the canonical T315I "gatekeeper" mutation and 1 patient who had a V299L mutation in the bosutinib arm. Newly detectable mutations occurring in >1 patient in the imatinib arm were E459K, F359V, T315I and Y253H, 1 patient in the imatinib arm had 3 mutations E355G/T315I/Y253H. There were no additional mutations in the ITT population. MR1 at Month 3 in Patients with ABL Copies ≥3000 at 3 months in the ITT population The rate of early molecular response (≤10% BCR-ABL at Month 3) was higher with patients in the bosutinib arm had ≤10% BCR-ABL at Month 3 compared to 60.5% (95% CI: 54.4%, 66.5%) in the imatinib arm. CCyR, MMR, MR4 and MR4.5 by Month 60 in Ph+ CML Patients Harboring b2a2 and/or b3a2 Transcripts Molecular and cytogenetic responses by Month 60 in the mITT population are presented in Table S5. The proportion of patients with MMR by Month 60 in the mITT population was higher in the bosutinib arm compared to the imatinib arm (OR: 1.52 [95% CI: 1.02, 2.25]). The proportion of patients with MR4 and MR4.5 by Month 60 in the mITT population was higher in the bosutinib arm compared to the imatinib arm (OR: 1.46 [95% CI: 1.02, 2.09] and OR: 1.50 [95% CI: 1.05, 2.16] for MR4 and MR4.5, respectively). The proportion of patients with CCyR by Month 60 in the mITT population was similar in the bosutinib arm compared to the imatinib arm (OR: 1.52 [95% CI: 0.97, 2.39]). Results for molecular responses were similar in the ITT population. Table Cumulative Cumulative Cumulative Cumulative a. b. c.

The duration of MR4 was not different between the treatment arms (HR: 1.13 [95% CI: 0.48, 2.62]). The results were similar in the ITT Population. Sustained MR4 A similar proportion of patients in both treatment arms achieved a sustained deep molecular response in the mITT population, 43.9% (95% CI: 37.7%, 50.1%) and 38.6% (95% CI: 32.4%, 44.7%) (OR: 1.24 [95% CI: 0.87, 1.78]) of patients in the bosutinib and imatinib arms, respectively, had 1-year sustained MR4. Results were similar in the ITT Population. Responses by Month 60 by Sokal Risk Group The benefit of bosutinib over imatinib was maintained across all Sokal risk groups, with greater differences between treatment arms seen in patients with high Sokal risk. Among patients with low, intermediate and high risk, the rates of MMR were 77.9% (95% CI: 69.1%, 86.7%) vs 71.6% (95% CI: 62.5%, 80.6%), 73.8% (95% CI: 65.5%, 82.2%) vs 67.4% (95% CI: 57.8%, 77.0%) and 67.9% (95% CI: 55.4%, 80.5%) vs 51.9% (95% CI: 38.5%, 65.2%) for bosutinib vs imatinib, respectively. In patients with high Sokal risk, deep molecular responses (MR4 and MR4.5) were higher in the bosutinib arm compared to the imatinib arm (MR4: 60.4% [95% CI: 47.2%, 73.5%] vs 37.0% [95% CI: 24.2%, 49.9%], respectively; MR4.5: 47.2% [95% CI: 33.7%, 60.6%] vs 25.9% [95% CI: 14.2%, 37.6%], respectively). The ORs for MMR were consistent across Sokal risk groups (2-sided p-value >0.05 for test of interaction) in the mITT population. Results were similar in the ITT population (95% CI for OR for MMR in high risk Sokal included 1 due to the smaller sample size in the mITT population and excluded 1 in the ITT population). Event-Free Survival by Sokal Risk Group In the low risk subgroup, the cumulative incidence of EFS events at Month 60 were 3.5% (95% CI: 0.9%, 9.0%) in the bosutinib arm and 6.3% (95% CI: 2.6%, 12.4%) in the imatinib arm; in the intermediate risk subgroup, the cumulative incidence of EFS events at Month 60 were 8.4% (95% CI: 4.1%, 14.6%) in the bosutinib arm and 8.7% (95% CI: 4.1%, 15.5%) in the imatinib arm; in the high risk subgroup, the cumulative incidence of EFS events at 10.9%, 31.9%) in the imatinib arm. The cumulative incidence curves were similar for both treatment arms in all risk groups (HR: 0.33 [95% CI: 0.07, 1.62] in the low risk subgroup, HR: 0.90 [95% CI: 0.34, 2.39] in the intermediate subgroup and HR: 0.43 [95% CI: 0.15, 1.25] in the high risk subgroup; 2-sided p-value >0.05 for test of interaction). The results were similar in the ITT population. Time to MMR by BCR-ABL Ratio at Month 3 in Patients with ≥3000 ABL Copies at 3 Months in the ITT Population The cumulative incidence of MMR was higher for patients with ≤10% vs >10% transcripts in both treatment arms. The cumulative incidence of MMR at Month 60 in patients with and without EMR respectively, was 84.0% (95% CI: 78.1%, 88.4%) and 56.5% (95% CI: 41.1%, 69.4%) (HR: 2.67 [95% CI: 1.90,3.75]) in the bosutinib arm and 82.4% (95% CI: 75.3%, 87.5%) and 46.9% (95% CI: 36.8%, 56.4%) (HR: 3.12 [95% CI: 2.19, 4.45]) in the imatinib arm. Event-Free Survival by BCR-ABL Ratio at Month 3 in Patients with ≥3000 ABL Copies at 3 Months in the ITT Population In the bosutinib arm, the cumulative incidence of EFS events at Month 60 were 5.5% (95% CI: 2.9%, 9.3%) in patients with EMR and 12.5% (95% CI: 5.1%, 23.4%) in patients without EMR (HR: 0.40 [95% CI: 0.14, 1.17]). In the imatinib arm, the cumulative incidence of EFS events at Month 60 were 5.2% (95% CI: 2.5%, 9.6%) in patients with EMR and 16.0% (95% CI: 9.6%, 23.8%) in patient without EMR (HR: 0.33 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.92]), demonstrating a lower event rate for patients with EMR. Responses by Month 60 by Age, Gender, Race and Region The ORs for MMR were consistent across all subgroups (2-sided p-value >0.05 for test of interaction). Safety Results: Extent of Exposure The median duration of study treatment was 55.10 months (range: 0.3 to 60.1 months) for patients receiving bosutinib compared with 55.03 months (range: 0.7 to 56.8 months) for patients receiving imatinib in the safety population. The median actual dose intensity was 393.6 mg/day (range: 39-583) in the bosutinib arm and 400.0 mg/day (range: 189-765) in the imatinib arm. In patients receiving bosutinib, 68.7% had at least 1 dose delay, compared with 45.7% of patients receiving imatinib, 45.5% had at least 1 dose reductions, compared with 24.5% of patients receiving imatinib. The proportion of patients with at least 1 dose escalation in the bosutinib arm was 21.6% compared with 31.3% in the imatinib arm. Adverse Events The proportion of patients reporting at least 1 TEAE was the same in the bosutinib arm (98.9%) as in the imatinib (98.9%) arm, most TEAEs were treatment related, 95.1% and 90.1% respectively. The number of patients (bosutinib vs imatinib) with Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (73.5% vs 57.0%), TEAEs leading to dose reduction (45.1% vs 24.5%) or temporary stop (68.7 vs 45.7%), treatment-emergent SAEs (36.6% vs 25.7%) and AEs leading to discontinuation (25.4% vs 14.3%) was higher in the bosutinib arm.

Deaths There were few deaths in patients receiving bosutinib (14, 5.2%) and imatinib (14, 5.3%). Of the 14 deaths in the bosutinib arm, 7 were due to AEs unrelated to study drug and 3 were due to disease progression. Of the 14 deaths in the imatinib arm, 3 were due to AEs unrelated to study drug, 1 was due to an AE related to study drug and 4 were due to disease progression. A total of 3 patients in the bosutinib arm and 4 patients in the imatinib arm died within 28 days of last dose; of these, 1 death in the imatinib arm was considered to be related study drug.

Pregnancy Exposure A total of 10 pregnancies were identified, 9 in the bosutinib arm and 1 in the imatinib arm. Of the 9 pregnancies in the bosutinib arm, there were 6 with paternal exposure and 3 with maternal exposure. Of the 3 cases of maternal exposure, 1 resulted in live birth, 1 resulted in elective termination due to an unintended pregnancy and 1 was a partial molar pregnancy requiring dilation and curettage. Of the 6 cases of paternal exposure, there were 4 live births without complications, 1 was an elective termination due to an unintended pregnancy, and in 1 case it was reported that the fetus was not growing properly and the pregnancy was to be terminated (further information regarding the pregnancy outcome was not available, there was no confirmation of congenital abnormality). Five out of 9 pregnancies resulted in healthy newborns, with the next most common outcome being elective termination. Furthermore, no specific bosutinib-induced congenital abnormalities were identified. Adverse Events of Special Interest The overall incidence of GI AESIs was 79.9% (214 patients) in the bosutinib arm and 61.5% (163 patients) in the imatinib arm. In both the bosutinib and imatinib arms, the most frequently occurring GI AESIs were diarrhea (75.0% vs 40.4%), nausea (37.3% vs 42.3%) and vomiting (20.5% vs 20.4%). While diarrhea occurred frequently in bosutinib-treated patients, it occurred early on-treatment (median time to onset 4.0 days), was generally short in duration (median duration 3 days). Overall, diarrhea AESIs were experienced by 75.0% of patients in the bosutinib arm and 40.4% of patients in the imatinib arm. The proportion of patients who required dose interruptions or dose reductions to manage the AE was higher in the bosutinib arm. However, of those patients with dose interruptions who got rechallenged, 94.4% and 88.9% were successfully rechallenged in the bosutinib arm and imatinib arm, respectively. Overall, 1.5% of patients in the bosutinib arm and 1.1% in the imatinib arm permanently discontinued treatment due to diarrhea. The overall incidence of liver function AESIs was 44.0% (118 patients) in the bosutinib arm and 15.5% (41 patients) in the imatinib arm. In both treatment arms, the most frequently occurring liver function AESIs were ALT increased (33.6% vs 6.0%) and AST increased (25.7% vs 6.8%).

There was 1 patient who developed concurrent elevations in ALT and AST ≥3 × ULN and total bilirubin 2 × ULN with alkaline phosphate level 2 × ULN without any confirmed alternative causes. Bosutinib was permanently discontinued. The patient was switched to imatinib and completed the long-term follow-up of the study. The overall incidence of cardiac AESIs was 11.2% (30 patients) in the bosutinib arm and 8.7% (23 patients) in the imatinib arm. The most frequently occurring cardiac AESI was sinus bradycardia (2.2%) in the bosutinib arm and ECG QT prolonged (3.8%) in the imatinib arm.

Overall, 0.4% of patients in the bosutinib arm and none in the imatinib arm permanently discontinued treatment due to cardiac AEs. The overall incidence of vascular AESIs was 7.5% (20 patients) in the bosutinib arm and 3.4% (9 patients) in the imatinib arm. The most frequently occurring vascular AESI was angina pectoris (3.0%) in the bosutinib arm and peripheral coldness (1.1%) in the imatinib arm. More patients with vascular AESIs required dose interruptions or dose reductions to manage the AE in the bosutinib arm than the imatinib arm (none of the patients in the imatinib arm had dose interruptions or dose reductions). Of those patients with dose interruptions in the bosutinib arm who got rechallenged, 100% were successfully rechallenged. Overall, 1.1% of patients in the bosutinib arm and 0.4% in the imatinib arm permanently discontinued treatment due to vascular AEs. The overall incidence of effusion AESIs was 6.0% (16 patients) in the bosutinib arm and 2.3% (6 patients) in the imatinib arm. Pleural effusion was experienced by 14 (5.2%) patients in the bosutinib arm and 5 (1.9%) patients in the imatinib arm. Pericardial effusion was experienced by 5 (1.9%) patients in the bosutinib arm and 1 (0.4%) patients in the imatinib arm. More patients with effusion AESIs in the bosutinib arm required dose interruptions or dose reductions to manage the AE. Of those patients with dose interruptions who got rechallenged, 100% were successfully rechallenged in both treatment arms. Overall, 0.7% of patients in the bosutinib arm and none in the imatinib arm permanently discontinued treatment due to effusion AEs. The overall incidence of renal AESIs was 10.4% (28 patients) in the bosutinib arm and 9.8% (26 patients) in the imatinib arm. The most frequently occurring renal AESI in both treatment arms was blood creatine increased (6.7% in the bosutinib arm and 8.3% in the imatinib arm).

Overall, 0.7% of patients in the bosutinib arm and 0.4% in the imatinib arm permanently discontinued treatment due to renal AEs. In addition, the hemorrhage, edema, myelosuppression, hepatic, infection, rash, hypersensitivity, gastrointestinal and hypertension AESIs were also evaluated. No notable changes since the 12 month-analysis were observed. Potentially Clinically Important Changes Overall, 99.6% of patients in the bosutinib arm had laboratory abnormalities compared with 100% of patients in the imatinib arm. A total of 72.4% of patients in the bosutinib arm had Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities compared with 75.1% of patients in the imatinib arm. The most common (≥10%) Grade 3 or 4 blood chemistry laboratory abnormalities occurring on treatment in the bosutinib vs imatinib arms were ALT increased (26.1% vs 3.0%), lipase increased (19.0% vs 7.9%), and phosphate decreased (9.3% vs 20.8%).

Cardiac Monitoring One (0.4%) patient in the bosutinib arm with QTcF ≥450 msec at baseline had a shift to QTcF 500 msec. There were no patients with shifts to QTcF 500 msec in the imatinib arm. In the bosutinib arm, shifts in LVEF to Grade 3 were observed in 2 (0.7%) patients, there were no patients with shifts to Grade 4. In the imatinib arm, there were no patients with shifts in LVEF to Grade 3 or 4. Conclusions:  The proportion of patients with MMR by Month 18 in the mITT population was not statistically different between the bosutinib and imatinib arms at the pre-specified 1-sided 0.0125 level. The rate of MMR by Month 18 was 61.0% with bosutinib and 52.7% with imatinib (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 0.99, 2.04, 1-sided p=0.0303).  Consistent with the primary efficacy endpoint of MMR at Month 12 that showed a higher MMR rate for bosutinib compared to imatinib, the long-term follow-up and final 5-year analysis showed higher molecular responses, including deep molecular responses, with bosutinib compared to imatinib. MMR by Month 60 in the mITT population was 74.0% compared to 65.6%, [OR: 1.52 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.24)] with bosutinib and imatinib, respectively. Similarly, deep molecular responses were also higher with bosutinib, 58.9% vs 49.8% [OR: 1.46 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.08)] of patients in the bosutinib and imatinib arms, respectively achieved MR4 and 48.4% vs 38.6% [OR: 1.50 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.16)] of patients in the bosutinib and imatinib arms, respectively achieved MR4.5.  The benefit of bosutinib over imatinib was maintained across all Sokal risk groups, with greater differences between treatment arms seen in patients with high Sokal risk score. In patients with high Sokal risk, deep molecular responses (MR4 and MR4.5) were higher in the bosutinib arm compared to the imatinib arm (MR4: 60.4% vs 37.0%, respectively; MR4.5: 47.2% vs 25.9%, respectively).  In patients with ≥ 3000 ABL transcripts at Month 3, a higher proportion of patients in the bosutinib arm achieved BCR-ABL transcripts ≤10% at 3 months; 80.6% and 60.5% [OR: 2.723 (95% CI: 1.819, 4.077)] of patients achieved an early molecular response in the bosutinib and imatinib arms, respectively.  Patients in the bosutinib arm achieved responses earlier than patients in the imatinib arm. The cumulative incidence function for CCyR, MMR, MR4 and MR4.5 was higher with bosutinib compared to imatinib in the mITT population (HR: 1.35 [95% CI: 1.11, 1.64], HR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.08, 1.63], HR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.04, 1.68], and HR: 1.38 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.81], respectively).  In responders, there were no differences in the duration of response and the K-M CCyR: 97.4% and 93.7%, respectively [HR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.14, 1.13], for MMR: 92.2% and 92.0%, respectively [HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.49, 2.44], for MR4: 88.9% and 89.1%, respectively [HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.48, 2.62]).  A similar proportion of patients in both the bosutinib and imatinib treatment arms in the mITT population achieved a sustained deep molecular response, 43.9% and 38.6% (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.78), respectively, had 1-year sustained MR4.  The rate of on-treatment transformation from CP CML to AP or BP CML was low, 6 (2.4%) patients in the bosutinib arm and 7 (2.9%) patients in the imatinib arm, progressed to AP or BP CML in the mITT population. There were no new transformations after the 2-year follow-up.  On-treatment EFS in the mITT population was not statistically different for bosutinib and imatinib tested at the pre-specified 1-sided 0.0125 level with HR: 0.64 (95% CI: 0.35, 1.17) and 1-sided p=0.0749. As expected for a 1L CP CML population, relatively few on- treatment EFS events were observed for this Month 60 follow-up (17 [6.9%] with bosutinib and 25 [10.4%] with imatinib)  An OS benefit was not observed in the mITT population HR: 0.80 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.73). Due to the pre-specified hierarchical testing strategy, OS was not tested since EFS was not statistically significant. As expected for a 1L CP CML population, there were few on‑study deaths at the Month 60 follow-up. High survival rates were observed in both arms, the OS rates at Month 60 were 94.9% (95% CI: 91.1%, 97.0%) with bosutinib and 94.0% (95% CI: 90.1%, 96.4%) with imatinib.  Fewer patients in the bosutinib arm had newly detectable mutations compared with patients in the imatinib arm in the mITT population. The spectrum of observed mutations was narrower for bosutinib compared to imatinib, with the canonical T315I "gatekeeper" mutation predominant for bosutinib.  The safety profile in the long-term follow-up was consistent with the primary analysis, there were no new safety signals identified.  The AE profile of bosutinib was distinct from that of imatinib. The safety profile of bosutinib was generally manageable and acceptable in patients with newly diagnosed CML and was consistent with that observed in other CML trials.  The proportion of patients reporting at least 1 TEAE was the same in the bosutinib arm (98.9%) as in the imatinib (98.9%) arm, most TEAEs were treatment related, 95.1% and 90.1%, respectively. The number of patients (bosutinib vs imatinib) with Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (73.5% vs 57.0%), TEAEs leading to dose reduction (45.1% vs 24.5%) or temporary stop (68.7 vs 45.7%), treatment-emergent SAEs (36.6% vs 25.7%) and AEs leading to discontinuation (25.4% vs 14.3%) was higher in the bosutinib arm compared with the imatinib arm. TEAEs leading to death occurred in 3 (1.1%) patients in the bosutinib arm and 4 (1.5%) patients in the imatinib arm.  The overall incidence of GI AESIs was higher in the bosutinib arm (79.9%) than in the imatinib arm (61.5%), there was a notable difference in diarrhea between the treatment arms (75% vs 40.4%). The majority of diarrhea events were Grade 1 in severity and few led to discontinuation of study drug, 1.5% of patients in the bosutinib arm and 1.1% in the imatinib arm.  The overall incidences of liver AESIs function AESIs was 44.0% in the bosutinib arm and 15.5% in the imatinib arm. In both treatment arms, the most frequently occurring liver function AESIs were ALT increased (33.6% vs 6.0%) and AST increased (25.7% vs 6.8%). Overall, 8.7% of patients in the bosutinib arm and 0.8% in the imatinib arm permanently discontinued treatment due to liver function AEs.  The overall incidence of cardiac AESIs was 11.2% in the bosutinib arm and 8.7% in the imatinib arm. The most frequently occurring cardiac AESI was sinus bradycardia (2.2%) in the bosutinib arm and ECG QT prolonged (3.8%) in the imatinib arm. Overall, 0.4% of patients in the bosutinib arm and none of the patients in the imatinib arm permanently discontinued treatment due to cardiac AEs. Cardiac ECG and LVEF abnormalities were infrequent in both arms. There was 1 (0.4%) patient with QTcF prolongation to 500 msec in the bosutinib arm vs 0 in the imatinib arm. There were no patients with shifts to Grade 4 in LVEF and only 2 (0.7%) patients with Grade 3 shifts in the bosutinib arm vs 0 patients with shifts in LVEF to Grade 3 or 4 in the imatinib arm.  The overall incidence of vascular AESIs was 7.5% in the bosutinib arm and 3.4% in the imatinib arm. The most frequently occurring vascular AESI was angina pectoris (3.0%) in the bosutinib arm and peripheral coldness (1.1%) in the imatinib arm. Overall, 1.1% of patients in the bosutinib arm and 0.4% in the imatinib arm permanently discontinued treatment due to vascular AEs.  The overall incidence of effusion AESIs was 6.0% in the bosutinib arm and 2.3% in the imatinib arm. Pleural effusion was experienced by 5.2% patients in the bosutinib arm and 1.9% patients in the imatinib arm. Pericardial effusion was experienced by 1.9% patients in the bosutinib arm and 0.4% patients in the imatinib arm. Overall, 0.7% of patients in the bosutinib arm and 0% of patients in the imatinib arm permanently discontinued treatment due to effusion AEs.  The overall incidence of renal AESIs was 10.4% in the bosutinib arm and 9.8% in the imatinib arm. The most frequently occurring renal AESI in both treatment arms was blood creatine increased (6.7% in the bosutinib arm and 8.3% in the imatinib arm). Overall, 0.7% of patients in the bosutinib arm and 0.4% in the imatinib arm permanently discontinued treatment due to renal AEs. 13.8% of patients in the bosutinib arm had shifts in eGFR to Grade 3b or higher, compared with 8.6% in the imatinib arm.  Overall, bosutinib was well-tolerated with toxicities that were manageable by dose interruption, dose reduction, and/or standard medical therapy and were mostly reversible. The bosutinib safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of bosutinib and the information contained in the current product label. There were no new safety signals identified with long term follow-up.  Given the limited number of patients were still on treatment or in long term follow-up at the time the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the study efficacy and safety assessments was minimal.
