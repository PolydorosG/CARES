Sponsor: Pfizer Inc Investigational Product: PF-06650833 Clinical Study Report Synopsis: Protocol B7921005 Protocol Title: A 12 Week Randomized, Double-Blind, Double Dummy, Parallel Group, Active and Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety Profile of PF-06650833 in Subjects With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis With an Inadequate Response to Methotrexate Investigators: Refer to Appendix 16.1.4.1 for a list of investigators involved in this study. Study Centers: The study was conducted at 103 centers: Australia (2), Bosnia and Herzegovina (3), Bulgaria (5), Croatia (2), Czech Republic (3), Georgia (7), Germany (1), Hungary (6), Republic of Korea (4), Mexico (4), Poland (9), Romania (6), Russian Federation (9), Serbia (7), Slovakia (6), Spain (5), Taiwan (3), Ukraine (8), and United States (US) (13). Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation and Completion Dates: Study initiation date (First Subject First Visit): 10 November 2016 Study completion date (Last Subject Last Visit): 15 August 2018 Report Date: 17 July 2019 Previous Report Date(s): Not applicable Phase of Development: Phase 2b Study Objectives: Primary Objective  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06650833 at 12 weeks, in subjects with moderately-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). Secondary Objectives  To assess the safety of PF-06650833 for 12 weeks in subjects with RA.  To assess other signs of clinical efficacy of PF-06650833 over 12 weeks.  To assess the effect of PF-06650833 on patient reported outcome (PRO) measurements. METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel group study to assess the efficacy and safety of PF-06650833 at Week 12 in subjects with moderately-severely active, anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positive (ACPA+) RA who had an inadequate response to MTX (up to approximately 50% of subjects might have also received 1 [and only 1] approved tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-inhibiting biologic agent administered in accordance with its labeling recommendations). The TNF-inhibiting biologic could have been discontinued due to its being not tolerated and/or its being deemed inadequately effective (as defined, for the purpose of this study, by the Investigator’s and subject’s opinions that the subject did not experience adequate benefit from the anti-TNF plus the presence of sufficient residual disease activity to meet the entry criteria). The anti-TNF biologic could also have been discontinued due to lack of continued access. After an up to 28 days Screening period, eligible subjects (in regions where tofacitinib’s inclusion as an active control was accepted by local regulatory authorities and ethics committees) were randomized in to receive 1 of 4 dose regimens of PF-06650833 (400 mg, 200 mg, 60 mg, 20 mg modified release [MR] tablets once daily [QD]), tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day (BID), or placebo (matching MR tablets for PF-06650833 QD and matching tofacitinib tablets BID) in a 6:6:6:5:5:5 ratio in a blinded fashion. In regions where tofacitinib’s inclusion in this study as an active control was not accepted by local regulatory authorities or ethics committees, subjects were only to be randomized to PF-06650833 or matching placebo (dispensed in blister packs) and were not to receive bottles of tofacitinib or matching placebo. In this study, all countries enrolled accepted the use of tofacitinib as an active control. Up to approximately 230 subjects were planned to be randomized globally into the study to ensure that at least approximately 198 subjects completed 12 weeks of active dosing (assuming a dropout rate of approximately 15%). Subjects participated in this study for approximately 20 weeks. This included an up to 28 days Screening period, 12 weeks treatment period, and 4 weeks follow-up period. Subjects remained on stable doses of permitted background arthritis therapy, which included MTX (supplemented with folic/folinic acid per local treatment guidelines). Subjects additionally might have continued stable doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, allowed opioids and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol for pain control, and/or low dose oral corticosteroids (10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day). Subjects must have been taking oral or equivalent parenteral (intramuscular or subcutaneous only, intravenous administration was not permitted) MTX for at least 3 months prior to Screening at an adequate dose to determine that the subject had an inadequate response to MTX. The MTX dose was required to have been stable for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study drug and the dose was required to remain stable during the study. Allowed MTX doses were 15 to 25 mg, inclusive, weekly, unless there was documented (in the source documentation) intolerance to or toxicity from these doses, in which case a dose between 10 and <15 mg, inclusive, might have been used. Folic or folinic acid were dosed per local standards of care stably for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study drug. NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, allowed opioids, acetaminophen and/or low dose oral corticosteroids (10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) were dosed stably for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. One (1) interim analysis for futility was performed, and the interim analysis did not have an option to stop the study early for efficacy. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Male and female (including women of childbearing potential willing to use required and acceptable contraception) subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 years, inclusive.  Diagnosis of RA and meeting the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA with a total score 6/10.  The subject had active disease at both Screening and baseline, as defined by both:  6 joints tender or painful on motion, and  6 joints swollen. and fulfilled 1 of the following 2 criteria at Screening:  High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) >7 mg/L at Screening performed by the central laboratory.  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (Westergren method) >28 mm/hr.  Met Class I, II or III of the ACR 1991 Revised Criteria for Global Functional Status in RA. Study Treatment: In order to maintain the blind and minimize bias, all subjects received the same number and types of tablets each day. Subjects assigned to PF-06650833 all took dispensed in a blister pack, once per day. In countries in which regulatory authorities and ethics committees accepted the use of tofacitinib as an active control in this study, subjects also took 1 matching tofacitinib placebo tablet (dispensed in bottles) BID. Subjects assigned to receive tofacitinib took 1 tablet (dispensed in bottles) of tofacitinib citrate (5 mg) BID. These subjects also took 4 MR tablets of placebo matching PF-06650833 MR tablets (dispensed in a blister pack) QD. The study drug information is provided in Table S1. Table S1.

Abbreviations: CR=controlled release; MR=modified release. Efficacy Evaluations: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change from baseline in the simplified disease activity index (SDAI) at Week 12. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  Change from baseline in SDAI at Weeks 4 and 8;  SDAI low disease activity score (LDAS) and remission rates at Weeks 4, 8, and 12;  Disease activity score (DAS) 28 LDAS and remission rates at Weeks 4, 8, and 12;  Change from baseline in DAS28-3 (ESR), DAS28-3 (C-reactive protein [CRP]), DAS28-4 (ESR), and DAS28-4 (CRP) at Weeks 4, 8, and 12;  ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responder rates at Weeks 4, 8, and 12;  Change from baseline in the tender/painful joint count (TJC) (28) and swollen joint count (SJC) (28) at Weeks 4, 8, and 12;  Change from baseline in hsCRP at Weeks 4, 8, and 12;  Change from baseline in the physician’s global assessment (PhGA) of arthritis at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Additional PRO Measures  Change from baseline in the patient’s assessment of arthritis pain (PAAP) visual analog scale (VAS), patient’s global assessment of arthritis (PtGA) VAS, and Health Assessment Questionnaire–Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Weeks 4, 8, 12;  Change from baseline in the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36) version 2 (acute) 8 domain scores and physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS), European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions 3 Level (EQ5D-3L) score, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) total score at Week 12. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAE) monitoring, vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse rate, and temperature), laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis including urine microscopy. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: An intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all subjects who were randomized to the study and received at least 1 dose of the randomized investigational drug (PF-06650833, tofacitinib, or placebo). Per-protocol (PP) population was defined as a subset of ITT who had no major protocol violations. The subjects excluded from the PP were determined and documented before the study was unblinded. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. The primary endpoint was assessed using Bayesian analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) modeling framework with baseline SDAI score as a covariate. A number of sensitivity/robustness analyses for the primary endpoint were conducted. A Bayesian ANCOVA analysis model with non-informative placebo prior distribution was performed as the primary sensitivity analysis. Other sensitivity analyses included the use of other statistical methods (ANCOVA, mixed effect model repeat measurement [MMRM]), analysis sets (ITT, PP), missing data imputation methods for ANCOVA (observed, last observation carried forward [LOCF]), and the inclusion of an additional covariate (previous anti-TNF use). Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Analyses of change from baseline in SDAI, DAS28-3 (ESR), DAS28-3 (CRP), DAS28-4 (ESR), DAS28-4 (CRP), hsCRP, TJC (28), SJC (28), and PhGA of arthritis at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 were based on the ITT population using an MMRM model with observed data. Analyses of number of subjects with SDAI remission (SDAI 3.3), SDAI low disease activity (SDAI 11), DAS28 remission (DAS <2.6), DAS28 low disease activity (DAS28 <3.2), and ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responder rates at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 were based on the ITT population using normal approximation with observed data and non-responder imputation (NRI) for missing data imputation. Additional PRO Measures: Analyses of secondary PRO endpoints were based on the ITT population using an MMRM model with observed data. Safety: Safety analysis set was defined as those subjects who received at least 1 dose of the investigational drug. Safety analysis was based on the safety analysis set. The summary was done for PF-06650833 (400 mg, 200 mg, 60 mg, 20 mg, QD), tofacitinib, and placebo arms. Safety data were presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate. All safety endpoints were listed and summarized in accordance with the Sponsor data standards. RESULTS All the results were reported including tofacitinib arm, except for the efficacy where tofacitinib data were exploratory and reported separately. Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 269 subjects were assigned to and treated with placebo (39 subjects), PF-06650833 (187 subjects), or tofacitinib (43 subjects), among which 237 subjects (88.1%) completed the study. Discontinuation rates in study appeared slightly higher in the placebo and PF-06650833 20 mg MR QD arms compared to the higher dose of PF-06650833 and tofacitinib arms but interpretation was limited by the small numbers of subjects. Discontinuation rates were similar in the tofacitinib and higher dose (above 20 mg) of PF-06650833 arms. There were no clear trends in discontinuations due to AEs or lack of efficacy. The majority of subjects were female (210 subjects [78.1%]) and white (254 subjects [94.4%]). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 53.7 (10.56) years, 73.28 (14.473) kg, and 27.04 (4.700) kg/m2, respectively. Demographic characteristics were similar across all treatment arms. The mean duration of RA since diagnosis was 7.876 years. The mean baseline SDAI for the entire study population was 41.94 and ranged from 39.63 (PF-06650833 20 mg MR QD arm) to 44.81 (placebo arm). The baseline RA characteristics were generally balanced across treatment arms. The majority of subjects had more than 10 joints involved (at least 1 small joint) (225 subjects [83.6%]), high-positive rheumatoid factor (RF) or high-positive ACPA (264 subjects [98.1%]), and abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR (268 subjects [99.6%]). All the subjects had RA symptoms no less than 6 weeks and met the EULAR classification criteria for RA with a mean RA total score of 9.6. Efficacy Results: Primary Endpoint: The mean change from baseline in SDAI at Week 12 was significantly higher in the PF-06650833 arms compared to the placebo arm (p-values 0.005 for all 4 PF-06650833 arms) based on the primary analysis using an informative placebo prior distribution. Based on the main sensitivity analysis using a non-informative placebo prior distribution, PF-06650833 200 mg and 400 mg doses remained statistically separated from placebo (p-values=0.0148 and 0.0098, respectively). Overall, SDAI response at Week 12 appeared to increase with dose in both primary and all pre-specified sensitivity analyses. Secondary Endpoints: Change from Baseline in SDAI (Longitudinal Using MMRM Model): Based on an MMRM model with observed data in the ITT population, statistical separation in least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in SDAI was observed for the 200 mg and 400 mg arms in comparison with placebo at Week 12. No clear separation from placebo was observed prior to Week 12 except for PF-06650833 60 mg MR QD arm at Week 4 (p-value=0.0373). SDAI LDAS (SDAI ≤11): No statistically significant differences in the rates of subjects achieving SDAI LDAS were observed in any PF-06650833 arms in comparison with the placebo arm across all time points determined, except for PF-06650833 400 mg MR QD arm at Week 8 (p-value=0.0449). SDAI Remission (SDAI ≤3.3): Overall, the incidence of subjects achieving SDAI remission was low across all PF-06650833 arms, and there were no statistically significant differences in the rates of subjects achieving SDAI remission in any PF-06650833 arms compared to the placebo arm across all time points determined. ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 Responder Rate: At Weeks 4, 8, and 12, no statistically significant differences in ACR20 or ACR70 responder rates were observed in any PF-06650833 arms compared to the placebo arm. At Week 12, the ACR50 responder rates were significantly higher in PF-06650833 200 mg and 400 mg MR QD arms compared to the placebo arm (p-values=0.0398 and 0.0160, respectively). At Week 8, the ACR50 responder rate was significantly higher in PF-06650833 400 mg MR QD arm compared to the placebo arm (p-value=0.0097). Change from Baseline in DAS28: Compared to the placebo arm, statistical analysis using an MMRM model with observed data in the ITT population demonstrated statistically significant differences in DAS28-4 (CRP) in PF-06650833 60 mg MR QD arm at Weeks 4 and 12 (p-values=0.0173 and 0.0365, respectively); in PF-06650833 200 mg MR QD arm at Week 12 (p-value=0.0208); and in PF-06650833 400 mg MR QD arm at Weeks 8 and 12 (p-values=0.0382 and 0.0060, respectively). DAS28 LDAS (DAS28 <3.2): There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of subjects achieving DAS28-4 (ESR) LDAS or DAS28-3 (ESR) LDAS in any PF-06650833 arms compared to the placebo arm at any time point determined with observed data in the ITT population. With observed data in the ITT population, the rates of subjects achieving DAS28-4 (CRP) LDAS were significantly higher in PF-06650833 400 mg MR QD arm at Week 8 (p-value=0.0158) and in PF-06650833 200 mg and 400 mg MR QD arms at Week 12 (p-values=0.0453 and 0.0324, respectively) compared to the placebo arm. With observed data in the ITT population, the rate of subjects achieving DAS28-3 (CRP) LDAS was only significantly higher in PF-06650833 200 mg MR QD arm at Week 12 compared to the placebo arm (p-value=0.0208). DAS28 Remission (DAS28 <2.6): With observed data in the ITT population, the rate of subjects achieving DAS28-4 (ESR) remission was only significantly higher than that in the placebo arm for the PF-06650833 200 mg MR QD arm at Week 4 (p-value=0.0367). No statistically significant differences in the rates of subjects achieving DAS28-3 (ESR) remission, DAS28-4 (CRP) remission, or DAS28-3 (CRP) remission were observed in any PF-06650833 arms compared to the placebo arm at any time point determined. High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein: Using an MMRM model based on observed data in the ITT population, the LS mean change from baseline in hsCRP was significantly greater in PF-06650833 60 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg MR QD arms compared to the placebo arm at Week 4 (p-values=0.0009, 0.0010, and 0.0011, respectively), in PF-06650833 60 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg MR QD arms compared to the placebo arm at Week 8 (p-values=0.0013, 0.0208, and 0.0208, respectively), and in PF-06650833 60 mg MR QD arm compared to the placebo arm at Week 12 (p-value=0.0329). Tender/Painful and Swollen Joint Counts (28): Statistical analyses using an MMRM model with observed data in the ITT population demonstrated no statistically significant differences in LS mean change from baseline in SJC (28) in any PF-06650833 arms compared to the placebo arm at any time point determined. Statistical analyses using an MMRM model with observed data in the ITT population demonstrated statistically significant greater LS mean change from baseline in TJC (28) in and in PF-06650833 60 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg MR QD arms compared to the placebo arm at Week 12 (p-values=0.0419, 0.0336, and 0.0452, respectively). Physician’s Global Assessment of Arthritis: Using an MMRM model based on observed data in the ITT population, the LS mean change from baseline in PhGA of arthritis was significantly greater in the PF-06650833 60 mg MR QD arm compared to the placebo arm at Week 4 (p-value=0.0351). Additional Patient Reported Outcome Measures: Using an MMRM model based on observed data in the ITT population, no statistically significant differences were observed in PAAP, PtGA of arthritis, HAQ-DI, SF-36 8 domain scores, SF-36 MCS and PCS, EQ5D-3L, or FACIT-F for any PF-06650833 arms compared to the placebo arm at any time point determined. Safety Results: A total of 123 subjects reported 222 all-causality treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), among which 48 subjects experienced 64 treatment-related TEAEs. However, the mild and non-treatment-related AE of thrombocytopenia under the system organ class (SOC) of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders from Day 1 to Day 30 reported by 1 subject in the PF-06650833 200 mg MR QD arm was determined as not treatment-emergent as the laboratory tests performed on Day 1 were before the first dose. Six (6) subjects reported severe TEAEs. Twelve (12) subjects permanently discontinued from study due to TEAEs, and 20 subjects temporarily discontinued from study or had dose reduction due to TEAEs. No deaths occurred in this study. Eight (8) subjects reported treatment-emergent SAEs, of whom 1 subject had very high elevations of liver transaminases that were reported by the Investigator as an SAE of “liver injury” based on a criterion of medical importance and that was considered treatment-related. The highest number of all-causality TEAEs reported by subjects were in the SOCs of Infections and Infestations (55 subjects [20.4%]) and Gastrointestinal Disorders (27 subjects [10.0%]). The most commonly reported all-causality TEAEs by preferred term were nasopharyngitis (14 subjects [5.2%]), rheumatoid arthritis (14 subjects [5.2%]), upper respiratory tract infection (10 subjects [3.7%]), and nausea (9 subjects [3.3%]). Most all-causality TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of all-causality TEAEs was similar across treatment arms. The highest number of treatment-related TEAEs reported by subjects were in the SOCs of Infections and Infestations (16 subjects [5.9%]) and Gastrointestinal Disorders (14 subjects [5.2%]). The most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs by preferred term were rheumatoid arthritis (6 subjects [2.2%]), alanine aminotransferase increased (5 subjects [1.9%]), and nausea, oral herpes, and upper respiratory tract infection (4 subjects each [1.5%]). There were no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, except for the elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) reported for the subject with the SAE of “liver injury”. There was no clear evidence of a relationship of incidence of laboratory test abnormalities with the dose of PF-06650833. None of the vital signs abnormalities were sustained or symptomatic and were likely clinically relevant. None of the ECG abnormalities were considered clinically significant, were repeated, or were reported as AEs by the Investigators. No subjects met Hy’s Law criteria for increased risk of drug-induced liver injury. Except for the placebo arm, no treatment arm had more than 1 subject meeting categorical changes in total bilirubin, AST, or ALT (ie, AST/ALT >3 × upper limit of normal [ULN], or bilirubin >2 × ULN). There was no apparent relationship between increases in AST and/or ALT >3 × ULN, and/or total bilirubin >2 × ULN and treatment assignment. The manifestation of atypical, needle-like crystals in urine was observed at any visit in only 2 subjects and neither case was associated with changes in serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or renal function. Overall, there were no clinically significant changes in renal function or persistent changes in relevant blood or urine laboratory test values. Review of all TEAEs and safety laboratory data revealed no consistent effects on hematologic parameters (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, platelets). The data suggested that PF-06650833 had no clinically meaningful effects on hematogenesis. Conclusions: Efficacy  PF-06650833 demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at Week 12 based on the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in SDAI using the pre-specified Bayesian analysis with an informative placebo prior (p-values 0.005 for all 4 PF-06650833 arms).  PF-06650833 also demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at Week 12 on the main sensitivity analysis of change from baseline in SDAI using the pre-specified Bayesian analysis with non-informative placebo prior. In this analysis, the treatment effects of the PF-06650833 200 mg and 400 mg doses remained statistically separated from placebo despite the fact that the placebo response was higher than that in the primary analysis when an informative prior was used.  PF-06650833 further demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo at Week 12 at the highest 2 doses (200 mg and 400 mg QD) on various pre-specified secondary/sensitivity analyses, including MMRM analyses utilizing longitudinal data of change from baseline in SDAI as well as ANCOVA in the ITT population.  The efficacy of PF-06650833 on the primary endpoint was supported by consistent trends of improvement in a number of secondary endpoints (SDAI LDAS, ACR50 response, change from baseline in DAS28, DAS28 LDAS, DAS28 remission, TJC [28], and hsCRP).  Greater efficacy was generally observed at the higher doses (200 mg and 400 mg) of PF-06650833 compared to the lower doses (20 mg and 60 mg).  With respect to PRO endpoints, there were no statistically significant differences in LS mean changes from baseline in PAAP, PtGA of arthritis, HAQ-DI, SF-36 8 domain scores, SF-36 MCS and PCS, EQ5D-3L, or FACIT-F between any PF-06650833 arms and placebo at any time point determined. Safety  No deaths occurred in this study. Eight (8) subjects reported treatment-emergent SAEs and 6 subjects experienced severe TEAEs. Twelve (12) subjects permanently discontinued from study due to TEAEs and 20 subjects temporarily discontinued from study drug or had dose reductions due to TEAEs.  An SAE for elevated transaminases was reported (with event term of “liver injury”) for 1 subject in the PF-06650833 20 mg MR QD arm. However, analysis of all AEs and laboratory data for trends in liver function tests with time and dose failed to demonstrate a clear relationship between treatment with PF-06650833 and increases in transaminase levels. The accumulated data available at this time therefore were insufficient to consider elevations in liver transaminases as a safety concern (or safety risk) for PF-06650833.  No clinically significant changes in renal function were observed in the current study. Two (2) subjects had laboratory abnormalities of presence of atypical, needle-like crystals (semi-quantitatively assessed as being of rare abundance [ie, 0-5/HPF]) in urine on at least one occasion that were asymptomatic, not persistent, and not associated with changes in serum creatinine or eGFR.  Multiple oral doses of PF-06650833 were generally well-tolerated in subjects with moderately-severely active RA participating in this small, 12-week treatment period, and demonstrated an overall safety profile supportive of a positive benefit-risk relationship in this patient population. Overall Conclusion  The efficacy and safety data derived from this study support the continued investigation of PF-06650833 alone or in combination as a potential disease-modifying treatment for patients with moderately to severely active RA.
