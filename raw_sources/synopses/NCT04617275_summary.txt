The effect of a 12-week administration of danuglipron on FPG and HbA1c in participants with non-diabetic obesity is excluded from this CSR synopsis, and will be included in a subsequent publication. METHODS Study Design: This Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sponsor-open, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was designed to assess tolerability, safety, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of twice daily (BID) administration of danuglipron (PF-06882961) in adult participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were treated with metformin. In addition, participants with obesity, without T2DM, were enrolled to explore differences in tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and PD between participants with T2DM and participants without T2DM and to support clinical development in both T2DM and obesity. The treatment period was 12 weeks, followed by an approximate 4-week follow-up. The dose titration scheme is presented in Figure S1. For participants with T2DM, the metformin dose (at least 500 mg/day) was required to be stable for at least 60 days prior to the screening visit (Visit 1) and remain the same until the first follow-up visit (ie, Visit 10, Week 13-14), except in circumstances where a dose change was deemed medically necessary. Figure S1. Dose Titration Schemes Abbreviations: BID = twice daily; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus. The treatment arm labels for Arms 1-7 in the CSR are: danuglipron 120 mg BID low, fast (T2DM) (for Arm 1); danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast (T2DM) (for Arm 2); danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow (T2DM) (for Arm 3); danuglipron 80 mg BID high, slow (T2DM) (for Arm 4); placebo (T2DM) and placebo (non-diabetic obesity) (for Arm 5); danuglipron 200 mg BID (T2DM) (for Arm 6); danuglipron 200 mg BID (non-diabetic obesity) (for Arm 7). The danuglipron 200 mg BID (T2DM and non-diabetic obesity) arms were both with high starting dose of 10 mg BID and fast titration steps (ie, danuglipron 200 mg BID high, fast). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Male or female participants between the ages of 18 and 75 years, inclusive, at Visit 1 (screening), who were participants with T2DM on stable metformin background (≥500 mg/day) for at least 60 days prior to Visit 1, or participants with non-diabetic obesity of stable body weight for at least 90 days prior to Visit 1, were eligible in the study. Study Treatment: The study intervention was danuglipron and matching placebo tablets, and was administered orally BID with food. All doses were blinded (double blinded for treatment period, and single blinded for the placebo run-in period) and consisted of 3 or 4 tablets BID with food. During Weeks 1, 2 and 9 after randomization, participants took 4 tablets of study intervention (danuglipron or matching placebo) in the morning and 4 tablets of study intervention in the evening, with approximately 10 to 12 hours apart of the doses. The study interventions were taken at approximately the same time each day. Participants took a total of 8 tablets daily. The same dosing paradigm was used during the single-blind placebo run-in period. During Weeks 3 to 8 and Weeks 10 to 12, participants took 3 tablets of study intervention in the morning and 3 tablets of study intervention in the evening, with approximately 10 to 12 hours apart. The study interventions were taken at approximately the same time each day. Participants took a total of 6 tablets daily. Participants swallowed the investigational product (IP) whole, and did not manipulate or chew the study intervention prior to swallowing. To maximize tolerability of danuglipron, dose was titrated over a period of 6 to 10 weeks. Refer to Figure S1 for dose titration schemes. Danuglipron and matching placebo tablets were both provided in blister packs and supplied centrally by the sponsor. See Table S2 for details. Table S2.

Blood samples collected for plasma concentrations of danuglipron were analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analytical method in compliance with applicable standard operating procedures (SOPs). Pharmacodynamics: PD parameters evaluated in this study included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight. The PD parameters of FPG and HbA1c were assessed by the Central Laboratory as part of the clinical laboratory assessments. Body weight was measured in duplicate, and the second weight measurement was obtained at least 1-2 minutes apart from the first weight measurement. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) monitoring, safety laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs (blood pressure [BP] and pulse rate), electrocardiograms (ECGs), management of glycemic control and metal health questionnaires (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS] and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Statistical Methods: Analysis Set Description Endpoints Estimand All evaluable participants with T2DM randomly assigned to IP and who PD Set 1A took at least 1 dose of IP. For participants who discontinued IP and/or received glycemic rescue medication, all subsequent values were censored. Estimand All evaluable non-diabetic participants with obesity randomly assigned to IP PD Set 1B and who took at least 1 dose of IP. For participants who discontinued IP, all subsequent values were censored. PK All participants randomly assigned to IP and who took at least 1 dose of PK Concentration danuglipron and in whom at least 1 concentration value was reported. SetSafety All participants randomly assigned to IP and who took at least 1 dose of IP. Safety Analysis Set Description Endpoints Abbreviations: IP = investigational product; PD = pharmacodynamic(s); PK = pharmacokinetics; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pharmacodynamics: Change from baseline in FPG at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12: A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis was fitted to the change from baseline (CFB) in FPG at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 from Estimand Set 1A to estimate the treatment effect related to Estimand 1A. The MMRM included treatment, time, strata (male versus female) and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, baseline as a covariate and the baseline-by-time interaction with time fitted as a repeated effect and participant as a random effect. An unstructured correlation matrix was used, and the Kenward-Roger approximation was used for estimating degrees of freedom for the model parameters. The above analysis was applied separately to Estimand Set 1B to estimate the treatment effect. Change from baseline in HbA1c at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12: CFB in HbA1c was analyzed using a similar MMRM model to that used for FPG above. Baseline HbA1c was included as a covariate in the model, rather than baseline FPG. No adjustments were made for multiplicity. This analysis was applied to Estimand Set 1A to estimate the treatment effect. It was also applied separately to Estimand Set 1B to estimate the treatment effect. Change from baseline in body weight at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12: CFB in body weight was analyzed using a similar MMRM model to that used for FPG above. Baseline body weight was included as a covariate in the model, rather than baseline FPG. No adjustments were made for multiplicity. This analysis was applied to Estimand Set 1A to estimate the treatment effect. It was also applied separately to Estimand Set 1B to estimate the treatment effect. Safety: Safety data were summarized in accordance with Pfizer Data Standards. All safety data were summarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulation, descriptive statistics, categorical summaries, and graphical presentations. PK: Danuglipron trough concentrations (C ) were summarized by treatment and by time point trough using the following descriptive statistics: number of participants contributing at each time point, arithmetic mean, median, minimum, maximum, Q1, Q3, standard deviation, geometric mean, and geometric coefficient of variation (CV) (%). Median C versus time point was trough plotted by dose including error bars representing the inter-quartile range (ie, Q1 to Q3). C values from PK samples that were collected after discontinuation of IP were listed but trough excluded from summarization. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 370 participants were screened for eligibility, of which 151 participants (123 in the T2DM arms and 28 in the non-diabetic obesity arms) were randomized to receive danuglipron or placebo in one of the 8 treatment arms. All randomized participants were dosed with study medication. T2DM Participants: Of the 123 participants with T2DM randomized, 78 (63.4%) participants completed the double-blind treatment, whereas 45 (36.6%) participants discontinued from the double-blind treatment.  There was a generally dose-related increase in the proportion of participants discontinuing from double-blind treatment, where the proportions were generally similar between arms titrating to the same target dose, regardless of starting titration with 5 or 10 mg BID.  The number (percentage) of participants discontinuing from double-blind treatment was 3 (18.8%) participants in the placebo arm, 7 (35.0%) participants in the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm, 6 (27.3%) participants in the danuglipron 80 mg BID high, slow arm, 9 (40.9%) participants in both the danuglipron 120 mg BID low, fast arm and 120 mg BID high, fast arm, and 11 (52.4%) participants in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm.  The most frequent reason for discontinuation during the double-blind treatment phase was AE (32 [26.0%] participants), followed by withdrawal by participant (6 [4.9%] participants) and lost to follow-up (5 [4.1%] participants). The most frequent reason for discontinuation in each treatment arm was AE, except for the placebo arm, in which the most frequent reason for discontinuation was withdrawal by participant.  There was also a generally dose-related increase in the proportion of participants discontinuing from double-blind treatment due to AEs. In contrast, there was no consistent trend for differences in the proportions between arms titrating to the same target dose, regardless of starting titration with 5 or 10 mg BID.  The number (percentage) of participants discontinuing from double-blind treatment phase due to AEs was 6 (30.0%) participants in the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm, 4 (18.2%) participants in the danuglipron 80 mg BID high, slow arm, 6 (27.3%) participants in the danuglipron 120 mg BID low, fast arm, 7 (31.8%) participants in the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast arm, and 8 (38.1%) participants in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm, compared with 1 (6.3%) participant in the placebo arm. A total of 94 (76.4%) participants completed follow-up period, which included participants who completed the double-blind treatment and participants who discontinued from the double-blind treatment but continued in the study. A total of 29 (23.6%) participants discontinued from follow-up period; the most frequent reason for discontinuation from follow-up was AE (14 [11.4%] participants). A total of 77 (62.6%) participants completed both the double-blind treatment and the follow-up periods. Non-Diabetic Obesity Participants: Of the 28 participants with non-diabetic obesity, 11 (39.3%) participants completed the double-blind treatment, whereas 17 (60.7%) participants discontinued from the double-blind treatment.  A higher proportion of participants in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm discontinued from double-blind treatment compared with the placebo arm (16 [72.7%] participants versus 1 [16.7%] participant, respectively).  The most frequent reason for discontinuation during the double-blind treatment phase was AE (12 [42.9%] participants), followed by withdrawal by participant (3 [10.7%] participants) and lost to follow-up (2 [7.1%] participants). The most frequent reason for discontinuation for the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm was AE, while for the placebo arm, the most frequent reason for discontinuation was withdrawal by participant. The number (percentage) of participants discontinuing from double-blind treatment phase due to AEs were 12 (54.5%) participants in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm, compared with 0 (0%) participants in the placebo arm. A total of 19 (67.9%) participants completed follow-up, which included participants who completed the double-blind treatment and participants who discontinued from the double-blind treatment but continued in the study. A total of 9 (32.1%) participants discontinued from follow-up; the reasons were AE, lost to follow-up and withdrawal by participant (3 [10.7%] participants each). A total of 11 (39.3%) participants completed both the double-blind treatment and the follow-up periods. T2DM Participants Versus Non-Diabetic Obesity Participants: The proportion of participants discontinuing from double-blind treatment phase was comparable between the placebo (T2DM) arm and the placebo (non-diabetic obesity) arm (18.8% and 16.7%, respectively), while a higher proportion of participants discontinued from double-blinded treatment phase in the danuglipron 200 mg BID (non-diabetic obesity) arm (72.7%) than the danuglipron 200 mg BID (T2DM) arm (52.4%). Similarly, a higher proportion of participants discontinued from double-blind treatment due to AEs in the danuglipron 200 mg BID (non-diabetic obesity) arm (54.5%) than the danuglipron 200 mg BID (T2DM) arm (38.1%). Similar results were observed with the proportion of participants discontinuing from follow-up: 18.8% in the placebo (T2DM) arm, 16.7% in the placebo (non-diabetic obesity) arm, 33.3% in the danuglipron 200 mg BID (T2DM) arm and 36.4% in the danuglipron 200 mg BID (non-diabetic obesity) arm. Demographic characteristics and physical measurements at screening are summarized:  Among 123 treated participants with T2DM, 52.8% participants were male and 47.2% participants were female. Across the T2DM arms, the study population was generally similar with respect to race, age, body weight and body mass index (BMI), with the majority of participants of White race, mean age of 58.3 years, mean body weight of 95.5 kg and mean BMI of 33.9 kg/m2.  Among 28 treated participants with non-diabetic obesity, 28.6% participants were male and 71.4% participants were female. Between the 2 non-diabetic obesity arms, the study population was generally similar with respect to race, age, body weight and BMI, with the majority of participants of White race, mean age of 48.7 years, mean body weight of 102.9 kg, and mean BMI of 37.3 kg/m2. Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done for the study. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Results: Pharmacokinetic Results Plasma danuglipron C values were variable between participants, generally increased trough with increasing dose and were overall in accordance with the employed dosing scheme in each treatment arm. Median C profiles in the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow (T2DM) trough and 80 mg BID high, slow (T2DM) arms increased up to Week 12 and Week 10, respectively, aligning with expectations based on the dosing scheme in these 2 arms. Median C profile in the danuglipron 120 mg BID low, fast (T2DM) arm increased up to Week 8 trough as per titration scheme but with some further increases noted thereafter up to Week 12. Median C profile in the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast (T2DM) arm increased up to trough 200 mg BID (T2DM) and 200 mg BID (non-diabetic obesity) arms, median C profiles in trough both arms increased up to Week 10 but with a trend of decrease noted between Week 10 and Week 12 especially in participants with non-diabetic obesity. A trend of lower median danuglipron C values was observed across all visits in trough participants with non-diabetic obesity, compared to participants with T2DM having the same titration scheme and target dose (200 mg BID). However, extensive between-participant variability in C was observed and interquartile range of the observed values was largely trough overlapping between the 2 populations. Across all treatment arms, a number of trough samples yielded concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), with the greatest incidence detected for the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast (T2DM) arm (Weeks 10 and 12 visits) and the danuglipron 200 mg BID (non-diabetic obesity) arm (Weeks 6, 8, 10 and 12 visits) at which more than 25% of the available C values were below the LLOQ (Q1 = 0). In addition, trough across all treatment arms, the number of available C values generally decreased over trough time (reflecting participant discontinuation) with the greatest impact detected for the danuglipron 200 mg BID (T2DM) and 200 mg BID (non-diabetic obesity) arms at which only 10 and 6 individual values, respectively were available at Week 12, compared to 20 and 22, respectively at Week 0. Pharmacodynamic Results Change From Baseline in FPG at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 – T2DM Participants (Secondary Endpoint) An MMRM model was used to analyze CFB in FPG at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Least square (LS) mean reductions from baseline in the placebo arm remained generally stable over time, with an LS mean CFB of -13.09 mg/dL at Week 12. The LS mean reductions from baseline generally increased in magnitude over time for all danuglipron dose arms up to Week 12, except for the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast and 200 mg BID arms. At Week 12 there was no apparent dose-response, with the LS mean CFB in FPG of -41.74 mg/dL, -40.41 mg/dL, -53.94 mg/dL, -23.34 mg/dL and -37.48 mg/dL for the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm, 80 mg BID high, slow arm, 120 mg BID low, fast arm, 120 mg BID high, fast arm and 200 mg BID arm, respectively. The LS mean differences from placebo of CFB in FPG at Week 12 were -28.65 mg/dL (90% confidence intervals [CIs]: -52.31, -4.99), -27.32 mg/dL (90% CIs: -49.67, -4.97), -40.85 mg/dL (90% CIs: -64.11, -17.59), -10.25 mg/dL (90% CIs: -33.59, 13.08) and -24.38 mg/dL(90% CIs: -48.69, -0.08) for the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm, 80 mg BID high, slow arm, 120 mg BID low, fast arm, 120 mg BID high, fast arm and 200 mg BID arm, respectively. With the exception of the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast arm, all of these LS mean reductions from baseline in the danuglipron dose arms at Week 12 were statistically significantly greater (1-sided p-value < 0.05) than statistically significantly greater LS mean reductions compared with placebo at the same time point. Change From Baseline in HbA1c at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 – T2DM Participants (Secondary Endpoint) An MMRM model was used to analyze CFB in HbA1c at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. LS mean reductions from baseline in the placebo arm were observed at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, with the largest LS mean reduction of -0.32% at Weeks 10 and 12. The LS mean reductions from baseline generally increased in magnitude over time for all the danuglipron dose arms up to Week 12 without reaching a plateau, except for the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast arm that had a smaller reduction at Week 12, compared to Week 10. At Week 12 there was no apparent dose-response of HbA1c with danuglipron dose level, with the LS mean CFB in HbA1c of -1.07%, -1.32%, -1.56%, -1.04% and -1.57% for the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm, 80 mg BID high, slow arm, 120 mg BID low, fast arm, 120 mg BID high, fast arm and 200 mg BID arm, respectively. The LS mean difference from placebo of CFB in HbA1c at Week 12 were -0.76% (90% CIs: -1.32, -0.20), -1.00% (90% CIs: -1.55, -0.46), -1.25% (90% CIs: -1.80, -0.69), -0.73% (90% CIs: -1.29, -0.16) and -1.25% (90% CIs: -1.82, -0.69) for the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm, 80 mg BID high, slow arm, 120 mg BID low, fast arm, 120 mg BID high, fast arm and 200 mg BID arm, respectively. All of these LS mean reductions from baseline in the danuglipron dose arms at Week 12 were statistically significantly different (1-sided p-value < 0.05) from placebo. At the majority of earlier time points, the danuglipron dose arms also had statistically significantly greater reductions compared with placebo at the same time point. Change From Baseline in Body Weight at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 – T2DM Participants (Secondary Endpoint) An MMRM model was used to analyze CFB in body weight at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. LS mean reductions from baseline in the placebo arm remained generally stable over time, with the LS mean CFB of -0.42 kg at Week 12 and the largest LS mean CFB of -0.67 kg at Week 10. The LS mean reductions from baseline generally increased in magnitude over time for all danuglipron dose arms up to Week 12, except for the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast arm. At Week 12 there was no apparent dose-response, with the LS mean CFB in body weight of -3.64 kg, -1.93 kg, -5.38 kg, -2.93 kg and -5.37 kg for the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm, 80 mg BID high, slow arm, 120 mg BID low, fast arm, 120 mg BID high, fast arm and 200 mg BID arm, respectively. The LS mean differences from placebo of CFB in body weight at Week 12 were -3.21 kg (90% CIs: -5.22, -1.20), -1.51 kg (90% CIs: -3.45, 0.44), -4.95 kg (90% CIs: -6.96, -2.95), -2.50 kg (90% CIs: -4.49, -0.51) and -4.94 kg (90% CIs: -7.03, -2.85) for the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm, 80 mg BID high, slow respectively. With the exception of the danuglipron 80 mg BID high, slow arm, all of these LS mean reductions from baseline in the danuglipron dose arms at Week 12 were statistically significantly different (1-sided p-value < 0.05) from placebo. At the earlier time points of Weeks 6, 8 and 10, all danuglipron dose arms generally had statistically significantly greater LS mean reductions than placebo. Similar values and conclusions were noted when LS mean percent CFB in body weight was also modelled using an MMRM model. Change From Baseline in Body Weight at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 – Non-Diabetic Obesity Participants (Secondary Endpoint) An MMRM model was used to analyze CFB in body weight at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. LS mean reductions from baseline in the placebo arm were generally stable over time with minimal reductions and an LS mean CFB of -0.11 kg at Week 12. The LS mean reductions from baseline in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm generally increased in magnitude over time up to Week 12, without reaching a plateau. The LS mean CFB for the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm at Week 12 was -3.85 kg, compared to an observed mean CFB of -7.2 kg in the 6 participants with a Week 12 measurement in the analysis set. The LS mean difference from placebo of CFB in body weight was largest at Week 12 for the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm, with a value of -3.74 kg (90% CIs: -8.23, 0.75). Similar values and conclusions were noted when LS mean percent CFB in body weight was also modelled using an MMRM model. Safety Results: AE T2DM Participants Of the 123 treated participants in the T2DM population, 79 (64.2%) participants reported a total of 247 AEs, of which 146 AEs were considered treatment related and were reported in 57 (46.3%) participants (Table S3):  Compared with 35 AEs reported in the placebo arm, the number of AEs in the danuglipron dose arms ranged from 33 to 53, with the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm reporting the lowest number and the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast arm reporting the highest number of AEs.  The proportion of participants with at least 1 all-causality AE in the danuglipron arms ranged from 60.0% to 72.7%, with the lowest proportion in the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm and the highest proportion in the danuglipron 120 mg BID low, fast arm, compared with 50.0% in the placebo arm.

All of the hypoglycaemia events met the protocol-defined hypoglycemic AE categories except for 1 participant each in the placebo arm, danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm and danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast arm. Severe hypoglycemia was reported in 1 participant in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm, which was not an SAE. Non-Diabetic Obesity Participants Hypoglycaemia AEs were reported in 2 (9.1%) participants in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm, and both were categorized as documented symptomatic hypoglycemia. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations T2DM Participants The most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in clinical chemistry and hematology parameters in the T2DM population was gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (U/L) ≥1.0 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (18 [14.6%] participants), followed by HDL cholesterol (mg/dL) <0.8 × LLN (16 [13.6%] participants), triacylglycerol lipase (U/L) >1.0 × ULN (15 [12.2%] participants), triglycerides (mg/dL) >1.3 × ULN (13 [11.0%] participants) and calcitonin (pg/mL) >1.0 × ULN (11 [9.4%] participants). The abnormality of GGT (U/L) ≥1.0 × ULN was experienced by 4.5% to 28.6% participants across the danuglipron dose arms compared with 6.3% participants for the placebo arm. The abnormality of HDL cholesterol (mg/dL) <0.8 × LLN was experienced by 0% to 25.0% participants across the danuglipron dose arms compared with 20.0% participants for the placebo arm. The abnormality of triacylglycerol lipase (U/L) >1.0 × ULN was experienced by 5.0% to 27.3% participants across the danuglipron dose arms compared with 12.5% participants for the placebo arm. The abnormality of triglycerides (mg/dL) >1.3 × ULN was experienced by 0% to 25.0% participants across the danuglipron dose arms compared with 13.3% participants for the placebo arm. The abnormality of calcitonin (pg/mL) >1.0 × ULN was experienced by 0% to 14.3% participants across the danuglipron dose arms compared with 13.3% participants for the placebo arm. There was no apparent adverse dose-related increase in the frequency of the laboratory abnormalities. Non-Diabetic Obesity Participants The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in clinical chemistry and hematology parameters in the non-diabetic obesity population were: bicarbonate (Meq/L) <0.9 × LLN (3 [10.7%] participants: 2 [33.3%] participants in the placebo arm and 1 [4.5%] participant in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm), HDL cholesterol (mg/dL) <0.8 × LLN (2 [7.7%] participants: 1 [20.0%] participant in the placebo arm and 1 [4.8%] participant in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm), triglycerides (mg/dL) >1.3 × ULN (2 [7.7%] participants: 1 [20.0%] participant in the placebo arm and 1 [4.8%] participant in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm), and bile acids (µmol/L) >1.0 × ULN (2 [7.1%] participants: 1 [16.7%] participant in the placebo arm and 1 [4.5%] participant in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm). There were no clinically meaningful laboratory abnormalities across treatment arms. Vital Signs T2DM Participants A total of 7 (5.7%) and 9 (7.3%) participants had supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) increases and decreases from baseline ≥30 mmHg, respectively. A total of 6 (4.9%) and 5 (4.1%) participants had supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increases and decreases from baseline ≥20 mmHg, respectively. No participants had supine pulse rate values meet the pre-specified criteria for abnormality (<40 bpm or >120 bpm). There were no dose-related trends in the frequency of vital sign abnormalities. The AEs of hypertension, hypotension and sinus tachycardia was reported in 1 participant each in the T2DM population. The AE of hypertension for 1 participant in the placebo arm was mild in severity, and not resolved at the end of the study. The AE of hypotension for 1 participant in the danuglipron 80 mg BID high, slow arm was mild in severity and resolved. A moderate sinus tachycardia occurred in 1 participant in the danuglipron 80 mg BID low, slow arm, followed by 2 occurrences of mild sinus tachycardia, all resolved. None of the AEs were related to study intervention, and none of the AEs led to discontinuation from study. Non-Diabetic Obesity Participants A total of 3 (10.7%) participants had supine SBP decreases from baseline ≥30 mmHg. A total of 2 (7.1%) participants had supine DBP decreases from baseline ≥20 mmHg. No participants had supine pulse rate values meet the pre-specified criteria for abnormality (<40 bpm or >120 bpm). ECG There were no dose-related increases in the frequency of ECG abnormalities across T2DM arms. For non-diabetic obesity arms, there were no apparent differences in the frequency of ECG abnormalities between the placebo and danuglipron 200 mg BID arm. No ECG findings were considered as clinically meaningful by the investigator. Mental Health None of the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) categories were observed in any participant during the study treatment period. The mean PHQ-9 total score across the visits ranged from 0.2 to 2.0 across the danuglipron dose arms in the T2DM population, compared with 0.5 to 1.2 in the placebo (T2DM) arm. The mean PHQ-9 total score across the visits ranged from 1.1 to 1.7 in the danuglipron 200 mg BID (non-diabetic obesity) arm, compared with 1.2 to 3.0 in the placebo (non-diabetic obesity) arm. Conclusion(s): Safety  The different titration schemes of danuglipron administered for 12 weeks were generally safe in participants with T2DM and participants with non-diabetic obesity, with tolerability profile consistent with the mechanism of action.  The most commonly reported AEs were in the Gastrointestinal Disorders system organ class (SOC), and these AEs were mostly mild or moderate in intensity, and showed a trend towards increasing incidence with increasing target dose (80, 120 or 200 mg BID).  Of the Gastrointestinal Disorders AEs, nausea and vomiting were among the most frequently reported all-causality AEs in the danuglipron arms in both the T2DM population and non-diabetic obesity population.  There was a generally dose-related trend in the proportion of participants who discontinued from study due to gastrointestinal AEs in the danuglipron arms.  No dose-related adverse trends were observed in laboratory, ECG or vital sign abnormalities.  There were no adverse trends in mental health as determined by C-SSRS or PHQ-9. PD T2DM Participants  The LS mean reductions from baseline in FPG at Week 12 ranged from -23.34 mg/dL to -53.94 mg/dL in the danuglipron dose arms, relative to -13.09 mg/dL in the placebo arm. With the exception of the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast arm, all LS mean reductions from baseline in the danuglipron dose arms at Week 12 were statistically significantly greater than placebo (1-sided p-value < 0.05).  The LS mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c at Week 12 ranged from -1.04% to -1.57% in the danuglipron dose arms, relative to -0.32% in the placebo arm. All LS mean reductions from baseline in the danuglipron dose arms at Week 12 were statistically significantly greater than placebo (1-sided p-value < 0.05). With the exception of the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast arm, all danuglipron dose arms had LS mean reductions from baseline that increased in magnitude over time and did not appear to plateau by Week 12.  The LS mean reductions from baseline in body weight at Week 12 ranged from -1.93 kg to -5.38 kg in the danuglipron dose arms, relative to -0.42 kg in the placebo arm. With the exception of the danuglipron 80 mg BID high, slow arm, all LS mean reductions from baseline in the danuglipron dose arms at Week 12 were statistically significantly greater than placebo (1-sided p-value < 0.05). With the exception of the danuglipron 120 mg BID high, fast arm, all danuglipron dose arms had LS mean reductions from baseline that generally increased in magnitude over time up to Week 12. Non-Diabetic Obesity Participants  The LS mean reduction from baseline in body weight at Week 12 was -3.85 kg in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm, relative to -0.11 kg in the placebo arm; the LS mean difference from placebo was -3.74 kg (90% CIs: -8.23, 0.75). The observed mean reduction from baseline at Week 12 was -7.2 kg in the 6 participants in the danuglipron 200 mg BID arm who completed double-blind treatment, compared to -0.3 kg in the placebo arm. PK  Plasma danuglipron C values were variable between participants, generally increased trough with increasing dose and were overall in accordance with the employed dosing scheme in each treatment arm.  A trend of lower median danuglipron C values was observed across all visits in trough participants with non-diabetic obesity, compared to participants with T2DM having the same titration scheme and target dose (200 mg BID). However, extensive between-participant variability in C was observed and interquartile range of the trough observed values was largely overlapping between the 2 populations.
