Approximately 40% or more of participants enrolled were to be on high intensity statin therapy defined as atorvastatin (40 mg or 80 mg per day) or rosuvastatin (20 mg or 40 mg per day). Enrollment of participants using low/moderate intensity statin (all other statin therapy) was capped at 50% on 01-Mar-2021. Participants were randomized to self-administer (or injected by their caregiver) SC doses of vupanorsen or placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) at a specified dosing regimen for 24 weeks. Study drug was supplied as prefilled syringes, with vupanorsen provided as either 60 mg or 80 mg strength according to the required total dose. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Adults ≥40 years of age with dyslipidemia who were on a stable dose of a statin were enrolled in this study. Study Treatment: Vupanorsen was supplied in masked, single-use, prefilled syringes of either 60 mg or 80 mg strength according to required dose. Placebo was supplied in masked, single-use, prefilled syringes of 0 mg. The study drug description is presented in Table S2. Table S2. Study Drug Description Placebo for PF- DN8045 20-002133 0 mg SOLUTION 07285557 Solution for Injection 100 mg/mL (80 mg/syringe) Efficacy Evaluations: Blood samples for measurement of total cholesterol (TC), direct LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, and direct very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) were collected from participants in a fasted state; non-HDL-C was calculated as TC – HDL-C. Blood samples for measurement of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), ApoB, ApoB-48, ApoB-100, apolipoprotein C (ApoC)-III, apolipoprotein A (ApoA)-I, and free fatty acids (FFA) were collected from participants in a fasted state. Blood samples for measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were also collected from participants in a fasted state. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Evaluations: For all participants, trough and post-treatment concentrations of vupanorsen in plasma were determined at specified times during the study. A listing of individual vupanorsen concentration was reported and summarized by treatment with and without stratification by individual immunogenicity status using descriptive statistics. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) and PK/ Pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses may have been explored using the combined data from this study and other clinical studies of vupanorsen are reported in a separate population analysis report. Serum ANGPTL3 was measured as the target PD endpoint in this study. Blood samples were collected for measurement of ANGPTL3 from participants in a fasted state at specified times during the study. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring, vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), adverse events (AEs) and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Each vupanorsen treatment group was compared to the pooled placebo group, ie, placebo-adjusted Least Squares (LS)-mean treatment effect for each dose was reported along with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and p-value without adjustment for multiple comparisons to placebo. The Mixed Model Repeated Measurements (MMRM) was used as the primary statistical method to estimate the difference of treatment effect between each dose of vupanorsen versus placebo at Week 24 for the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints. For percent change from baseline in non-HDL-C, TG, ApoB, LDL-C, and ANGPTL3 at Week 16 only summary statistics and mean plot [Mean +/- Standard Error (SE)] over time were produced. Three supplementary analyses were conducted for additional evaluation of the primary and key secondary endpoints (ie, evaluated at Week 24). The first two, one using the MMRM model and the other using the multiple imputation using retrieved dropouts (MI-RD) approach, based on the treatment policy (TP) estimand was applied to the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The last one, was conducted in the framework of the principal stratum estimand. A Bayesian dose-response model was constructed to model the relationship between percent change from baseline at Week 24 and dose of vupanorsen, along with estimated 95% CI, for each of the primary and selected key secondary endpoints, respectively. Safety endpoints were summarized using total number of participants, number of participants in each response category and percentage, by treatment groups and visits. PD endpoints were analyzed using logistic regression based on MMRM multiple imputation. A 3-tier approach was used to summarize AEs. Risk difference of each dose group versus placebo was reported. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 286 participants were randomized into the study and received treatment (Table S5). The 160 mg Q2W dose group had the highest incidence (14 [38.9%] participants) of discontinuation from treatment due to AE followed by the 80 mg Q2W dose group (9 [20.0%] participants) and the 120 mg Q2W dose group (7 [15.2%] participants) (Table S3). CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS of participants were male (55.9%), White (87.4%), and not Hispanic or Latino (90.6%). The mean age of participants was 63.57 years and 38.1% were in the 55 to 64 and 65 to 74 age range.    Non-HDL-C at Week 24 Primary Endpoint Results Vupanorsen treatment led to statistically significant reductions in the primary endpoint, percent change from baseline in non-HDL-C at Week 24, compared to placebo at all doses. The LS mean (95% CI) reductions (all endpoint results are presented as placebo-adjusted) in non-HDL-C ranged from -22.0% (95% CI: -31.7, -12.4) for the 60 mg Q2W group to -27.7% (95% CI: -35.7, -19.6) for the 80 mg Q2W group (Table S6 and Figure S1). There was no clear dose response.  Figure S1. LS Mean Plot of Percent Change From Baseline Over Time Until Week 24 in Non-HDL-C (mg/dL) - MMRM - Full Analysis Set (Primary)   Week 24 is presented in Table S8.  Triglycerides at Week 24 All vupanorsen treatment groups demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in percent change from baseline in TG versus placebo (difference from placebo LS mean [95% CI] ranged from -41.3% [95% CI: -54.8, -27.8] for the 120 mg Q4W group to -56.8% [95% CI: -68.9, -44.7] for the 160 mg Q2W group [Table S9]). LS mean plot of percent change from baseline over time until Week 24 for TG obtained from MMRM is provided in Figure S2.  in TG (mg/dL) - MMRM - Full Analysis Set (Primary) The TP supplementary analysis results in Table S10 were similar to the main analysis results (Table S9) in that the reductions were statistically significant. However, LS means were generally smaller for the MMRM-TP analysis.  most dose groups than the primary analysis MMRM (hypothetical) (Table S9).  In ApoB, all vupanorsen treatment groups except for 120 mg Q2W showed statistically significant reductions in percent change from baseline versus placebo (Table S12 and Figure S3). The difference from placebo LS mean (95% CI) in ApoB at Week 24 ranged from -6.0% (95% CI: -13.0, 1.0) for the 120 mg Q2W group to -15.1% (95% CI: -23.7, -6.5) for the 80 mg Q4W group.  Figure S3. LS Mean Plot of Percent Change From Baseline Over Time Until Week 24 in ApoB (mg/dL) - MMRM - Full Analysis Set (Primary) Only the 80 mg Q2W and 160 mg Q4W treatment groups showed a statistically significant percent change from baseline versus placebo in direct LDL-C (Table S13). The difference from placebo LS mean (95% CI) in direct LDL-C at Week 24 ranged from -7.9% (95% CI: -21.0, 5.2) for the 60 mg Q2W group and -7.9% (95% CI: -18.3, 2.5) for the 120 mg Q2W group to -16.0% (95% CI: -26.7, -5.3) for the 80 mg Q2W group (Table S13 and Figure S4).  Figure S4. LS Mean Plot of Percent Change From Baseline Over Time Until Week 24 in Direct LDL-C (mg/dL) - MMRM - Full Analysis Set (Primary) There was a statistically significant reduction in percent change from baseline in ANGPTL3 at Week 24 for all treatment groups (p <0.001). The difference from placebo LS mean (95% CI) in ANGPTL3 at Week 24 ranged from -69.9% (95% CI: -81.6, -58.1) for the 80 mg Q4W group to -95.2% (95% CI: -106.2, -84.2) for the 160 mg Q2W group (Table S14 and Figure S5).  in ANGPTL3 (ng/mL) - MMRM - Full Analysis Set Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Results: Vupanorsen concentration in plasma increased in a dose-dependent manner at trough and 2 hours to 4 hours after administration (as defined in the protocol) with no significant accumulation with repeated dosing in ADA-Negative participants. In ADA-Positive participants, the trough concentrations increased over time but not the peak concentrations. The overall incidence of ADA with vupanorsen treatment was 30.7%, with 26.5% as treatment-induced and 4.2% as treatment-boosted (Table S15). No apparent difference was observed between ADA-Positive and ADA-Negative participants in serum ANGPTL3, non-HDL-C, TG, direct LDL-C, and ApoB percent change from baseline in the PK/PD population.  11.1. Extent of Exposure A total of 220 (76.9%) participants received study drug for >24 weeks to ≤30 weeks (Table S16). The overall mean duration of treatment was 152.9 days. PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 36 PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 37 All AEs were all-causality and treatment-emergent unless otherwise specified (Table S17).  The proportion of participants with AEs was greatest in the 160 mg Q2W group (86.1%) and lowest in the 120 mg Q4W group (52.2%) compared to the other vupanorsen groups versus 70.5% for placebo.  The proportion of participants with SAEs was highest in the 80 mg Q2W group (13.3%) and lowest in the 120 mg Q4W group (0%) versus placebo (9.1%). None of the SAEs were considered related to treatment.  The proportion of participants who experienced a severe AE was approximately 2 times greater in the 60 mg Q2W group (16.7%) compared to the 80 mg Q4W (8.7%) and 80 mg Q2W (8.9%) groups. The proportion of participants with severe AEs was lowest in the 120 mg Q2W (4.3%), 160 mg Q4W (4.4%), and 160 mg Q2W (5.6%) groups. No severe AEs were reported in the 120 mg Q4W group (0%). The proportion of participants with severe AEs for placebo was 11.4%.  All treatment groups had participants who discontinued study drug due to AEs and continued in the study. The proportion of participants who discontinued study drug due to AEs and continued in the study ranged from 8.3% in the 60 mg Q2W group to 38.9% in the 160 mg Q2W group. The proportion of participants who discontinued study drug due to AEs and continued in the study in the placebo group was 2.3%.  The proportion of participants who discontinued the study due to AEs was low (4.2% in the 60 mg Q2W group and 2.2% in the 80 mg Q2W group). None of the participants discontinued the study due to AEs in the other vupanorsen treatment groups. There were no participants in the placebo group who discontinued the study due to AEs.  Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) (All Causalities) that occurred in ≥5% of participants are listed in Table S18. Injection site reactions (ISRs) were among the most common TEAEs in all dose groups and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased was the most common in the 2 highest dose groups.

Of participants who discontinued study drug due to AEs, the greatest number discontinued for ISR AEs. At the 2 highest vupanorsen doses, liver-related AEs were the most common reason for discontinuation from study drug (Table S19). The most common PTs in any vupanorsen dose group that led to discontinuation from study drug are summarized in Table S19. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Deaths (None) No participants died during this study. Other Serious Adverse Events There were 22 SAE cases that occurred in 21 participants (Table S20). None of the events were considered treatment-related by the investigator or the sponsor. SAEs occurred in all treatment groups except 120 mg Q4W (Table S20). CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 49 CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 50 CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS PFIZER CONFIDENTIALPage 51 Other Significant Adverse Events ISRs were defined as an adverse event of special interest (AESI) in the protocol. ISRs included bruising, dermatitis, erythema, pain, rash, vesicles, recall, cellulitis, discomfort, and general reactions. Recall reactions were defined as ISRs that occurred at a prior injection site after a subsequent injection treatment at a different site. All treatment groups had participants who experienced ISRs. The percentage of participants in the vupanorsen treatment groups who had ISRs ranged from 13.3% to 33.3% and was higher than the placebo group (4.5%). The largest percentage of participants experiencing ISRs was in the highest treatment group (160 mg Q2W) followed by the 120 mg Q4W group. Injection site recall reactions occurred in 5 of the 7 vupanorsen treatment groups and did not appear dose-related. The percentage of participants with recall reactions ranged from 4.3% to 10.9%, with the highest percentage in the 120 mg Q2W group. TEAEs by SOC and PT (ISRs) are summarized in Table S21. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Analysis and Discussion of Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events  There were no deaths in the study.  Twenty-one participants experienced SAEs (Table S20); none were treatment-related. Forty-two participants discontinued study drug due to AEs and continued the study, with greater proportions of discontinuations due to AEs occurring in the vupanorsen groups than placebo (Table S17 and Table S19).  ISR AEs were reported in higher numbers among the vupanorsen groups, with the highest incidence in the 160 mg Q2W group (Table S21).  ALT/AST elevations were also higher among the vupanorsen groups compared to placebo and appeared to be dose-dependent with the highest incidences at the top 2 vupanorsen doses (Table S18).  No Hy’s law cases were observed in the vupanorsen groups (Figure S10 and Figure S11).  No safety signals were identified with regards to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or platelet counts (Table S22, Figure S6, and Figure S7).  Increases in HFF measured by magnetic resonance imaging derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) at Week 24 were observed with vupanorsen treatment compared to placebo for doses of 120 mg Q4W and higher (Table S25). Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Platelets and eGFR The mean change in platelet count from baseline over time until follow-up is shown in Figure S6. One participant (160 mg Q2W) had a platelet count <50 10^9/L (actual count was 7 10^9/L). The platelet count was repeated at a local lab 7 days later and the value was 184 10^9/L, suggesting this was a lab error (Table S22). There were 3 participants (60 mg Q2W, 80 mg Q2W, 160 mg Q2W) with eGFR decreases ≥50% from baseline, but these were transient and reversible (Table S22). The mean change from baseline over time until follow-up in eGFR is shown in Figure S7. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Figure S6.

Mean Plot of Change From Baseline Over Time Until Follow-Up in eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) - Safety Population ALT, AST, and Bilirubin Increases in ALT >3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred more frequently with higher vupanorsen doses and ranged from 0% (80 mg Q4W) to 44.4% (160 mg Q2W) of participants compared to 2.3% in the placebo group. One (2.2%) participant in the 120 mg Q2W group, 3 (8.3%) in the 160 Q2W group, and 1 (2.3%) in the placebo group had ALT elevations >8 times the ULN (Table S23). Increases in AST >3 times the ULN occurred more frequently with higher vupanorsen doses and ranged from 0% (80 mg Q4W, 120 mg Q4W, and 80 mg Q2W) to 16.7% (160 mg Q2W) of participants compared to 2.3% in the placebo group (Table S23). One (2.8%) participant in the 160 mg Q2W group and 1 (2.3%) in the placebo group had AST elevations >8 times the ULN, meeting the protocol criterion for discontinuation from study treatment. There were no Hy’s law cases in the vupanorsen treatment groups (Figure S10 and Figure S11). Dose-dependent increases in AST and ALT at Week 24 were observed in all vupanorsen treatment groups except 80 mg Q4W when compared to placebo with the greater changes being dose-dependent for both ALT and AST (Figure S8 and Figure S9). eDISH plots of ALT, AST, and total bilirubin are in Figure S10 and Figure S11. The plots are consistent with the trends noted above. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Figure S8.

CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS HFF Increases in HFF measured by MRI-PDFF were observed with vupanorsen doses of 120 mg Q4W and higher compared to placebo, with the maximum increase seen in the 160 mg Q2W treatment group where the ratio of LS mean relative change over placebo was 1.79 (95% CI: 1.47, 2.16) (Table S25). CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Conclusion(s): Vupanorsen treatment resulted in statistically significant reductions in non-HDL-C, TG, and ANGPTL3 at all doses and ApoB at all doses except 120 mg Q2W. Statistically significant reductions in direct LDL-C were observed only at the 80 mg Q2W and 160 mg Q4W doses. ISRs, liver enzyme abnormalities, HFF increases, ADA, and discontinuations from study treatment due to these AEs were more frequent in the higher monthly vupanorsen dose groups.
