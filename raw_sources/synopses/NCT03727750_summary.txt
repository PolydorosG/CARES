Report Date: 22 September 2021 Previous Report Date(s): Not applicable Phase of Development: Phase 4 Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints a . Collection of banked biospecimens is not addressed in this CSR. METHODS Study Design: This single-arm, open-label Phase IV study, was designed to fulfill Food and Drug Administration (FDA) post marketing requirements (PMR) and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommendations. Participants were evaluated for the effect of GO on the QTc, PK, safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy following the fractionated dosing regimen of GO as monotherapy in patients (≥12 years) with relapsed or refractory CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Sample Size: A sample size of 50 adult participants and 6 pediatric (adolescence, 12-17 years) participants were planned for this study. As per regulatory feedback, the study was terminated prematurely and considered completed with the 50 adults and 1 pediatric participant enrolled and treated. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Participants ≥12 years with refractory or relapsed CD33-positive AML were enrolled in this study. Study Intervention: Treatment administration consisted of 3 doses of GO 3 mg/m2 (up to one vial per dose) administered at investigational site as a 2-hour IV infusion after premedication on Days 1, 4, and 7 at each cycle. Participants received 1 or 2 cycles of GO. The second cycle of GO was allowed at the investigator’s discretion for participants who met selected dosing criteria after the first cycle. Investigational product lots used in this study are as shown in Table S2. Table S2. Investigational Product Description single-dose vial Efficacy Evaluations: Response of remission status (CR or CRi) were evaluated using blood and bone marrow aspirations per European Leukemia Net (ELN) 2017 recommendation. Survival status was followed for all participants for the study duration. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Plasma samples were analyzed for total hP67.6 antibody and calicheamicin (conjugated and unconjugated) concentrations using a validated in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures methods. Immunogenicity Evaluations: Plasma samples were analyzed for ADA against PF-05208747 using a semi-quantitative electrochemiluminescent (ECL) method; ADA positive samples were further analyzed for NAb against PF-05208747 using a semi- quantitative cell-based method. Metabolic Profiling Evaluations: Blood and urine samples for profiling of GO metabolites in a subset of 6 of the enrolled participants 18 years or older was collected. Pharmacodynamic (PD) Evaluations: PD evaluations were performed using blood samples to measure CD33 site saturation. Immunophenotyping Evaluations: Immunophenotyping evaluations, including CD33 expression, were performed using bone marrow or peripheral blood. Safety Evaluations: Primary Safety Endpoint: Change from baseline in QTc according to Fridericia’s (QTcF) method evaluated using triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs). Other Secondary Safety Endpoints: Included AEs, clinical examinations (including blood pressure and pulse), ECGs, and laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis). Statistical Methods: Binary data: Binary variables were summarized by frequency counts and percentages. Best response additionally included a 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval (CI) for the rate. Continuous data: Descriptive statistics, including the number of non-missing values and numbers of missing values, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and first and third quartile (Q1 and Q3). Some summaries also include the coefficient of variation (CV). The change from baseline in ECG parameters, including the primary endpoint (change from baseline in QTc interval) was summarized with descriptive statistics. Additionally, a linear model with the Cycle 1 nominal timepoints as a fixed effect and unstructured variance/covariance to account for the repeated measurements from participants was used for the primary analysis to estimate the mean change in QTc at the post baseline Cycle 1 nominal timepoints (using least squares mean) along with 2-sided 90% CI for the least squares mean. Confidence intervals used the approximate t-distribution with degrees of freedom by Kenward Roger method. ECG parameter results (absolutes) were summarized with descriptive statistics and a 90% CI for the mean were calculated using the t-distribution and the observed standard deviation from the particular timepoint. Categorical data: Qualitative variables (including some continuous variables where categories are defined) were summarized by frequency counts and percentages. If the analysis refers only to certain cycle or timepoints, then percentages were based on the number of participants with an assessment at that cycle or timepoint. Time to event data: Time to event endpoints were summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated survival curves were displayed graphically. The quartiles and probabilities of an event at particular points in time were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Confidence intervals for quartiles were based on the Brookmeyer-Crowley method. Confidence intervals for the estimated probability of event at a particular timepoint were generated using the log(-log) method with back transformation to a CI on the untransformed scale. Summaries of the number and percentages of participants with an event were also provided. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: 52 (51 adults and 1 pediatric) participants were assigned to treatment in this study. 51 of the 66 adult participants screened were assigned to GO of which 50 adult participants received GO treatment and 1 adult participant who did not receive GO treatment (assigned to treatment via Interactive Response Technology [IRT] in error). The 1 pediatric participant received GO treatment but the pediatric participant data is not presented in the results section. Of the 51 adult participants enrolled, 4 (7.8%) participants permanently discontinued treatment (this includes the 1 adult participant that did not receive GO treatment) and the remaining 47 (92.2%) completed treatment. The 50 treated adult participants were evaluated for pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and analyzed for safety (QTc and adverse events). 51 adult participants were evaluated for efficacy (based on the full analysis set) and 46 adult participants were evaluated for PD parameters. Baseline Demographic Characteristic: Median (min, max) age was 67 (22.0, 82.0) years. 32 (62.7%) were ≥65 years of age, 31 (60.8%) were male and 39 (76.5%) participants were White. Efficacy Results: Response Results • A best overall response (BOR) based on CR+CRi was achieved in 5 (9.8%, 95% CI: 3.3, 21.4) participants. Overall Survival • The median overall survival was 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.7, 4.2). • The percent of participants alive at 12 months was 4.3 (95% CI: 0.8, 12.9). Pharmacokinetics Results: Following a single infusion of GO at 3 mg/m2 (Cycle 1, Day 1 [C1D1]), • Peak conjugated calicheamicin (ac-CL-184538), unconjugated calicheamicin (CL-184538) and total HP67.6 (Gemtuzumab) antibody concentrations occurred around the end of the of 2-hour infusion with median time for maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) values of 2.08, 2.17 and 2.08 hours, respectively. • Exposures as measured by geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time zero to 72 hours post-dose (AUC ) and maximum plasma 72 concentration (Cmax) were 93490 pg.hr/mL and 6457 pg/mL; 247.8 pg.hr/mL and 45.69 pg/mL; and 3797 ng.hr/mL and 282.1 ng/mL for ac-CL-184538, CL-184538 and total HP67.6 antibody, respectively. Following multiple fractionated infusions of GO at 3 mg/m2 (Cycle 1, Day 7 [C1D7]), • Median Tmax values were 2.13, 3.92 and 2.17 hours for ac-CL-184538, CL-184538 and total HP67.6 antibody, respectively. • Exposures as measured by geometric mean AUC from time zero to 336 hours post- dose (AUC ) and C were 461500 pg.hr/mL and 11740 pg/mL; 1639 pg.hr/mL 336 max and 58.76 pg/mL, and 26820 ng.hr/mL and 585.6 ng/mL for ac-CL-184538, CL-184538 and total HP67.6 antibody, respectively. In general, both ac-CL-184538 and CL-184538 followed the same time course as total HP67.6 antibody for both C1D1 and C1D7. Inter-participant variability for geometric mean AUC and C values across both C1D1 and max C1D7 for ac-CL-184538, CL-184538 and total HP67.6 antibody were generally high. Immunogenicity Results: • Among the 50 participants treated with GO, 12 (24%) participants had positive ADA (titer ≥75) against GO at baseline. The presence of positive ADA at baseline was likely due to pre-existing host antibodies that were cross reactive with GO. There was no treatment-boosted ADA response. • Treatment-induced ADA was detected in 6 (12%) participants with an overall median peak titer of 276 (interquartile range [Q1, Q3]: 182.0, 674.0). • There were no participants who tested positive for NAb at baseline and therefore no participants had a treatment-boosted response. Treatment-induced NAb was detected in 1 (2.0%) participant. • The median onset for treatment-induced ADA and NAb was 18 days (Q1, Q3: 15, 21) and 76 days, respectively; while the median duration was 3.5 days (Q1, Q3: 1, 73) and 1 day, respectively. Five of the 6 participants had persistent ADA response. Other Results: Metabolic Profiling: • The calicheamicin-related metabolites of GO were identified in plasma and urine samples from the 6 participants. • A total of 7 metabolites were detected in urine: N-acetyl-γ-calicheamicin dimethyl hydrazide (N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH; PF-06649266; M17; m/z 1516 - corresponding to [M+K]+), N-acetyl-ε-calicheamicin (N-Ac-ε-calicheamicin; PF-06691414; M16, observed as two isomers M16a and M16b; m/z 1372 – corresponding to [M+K]+), N-Ac-ε-calicheamicin with the addition of two hydrogen atoms (M9; m/z 1374 – corresponding to [M+K]+) and three tetrasaccharide products (M5 and M7; m/z 1041 – corresponding to [M+K]+ and M11; m/z 1043 – corresponding to [M+K]+). • A total of 3 metabolites were detected in plasma: N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH (M17), one isomer of N-Ac-ε-calicheamicin (M16a) and a tetrasaccharide product (M11). Pharmacodynamics Results (CD33 Site Saturation): • Following 3 mg/m2 GO administration, the highest median percent CD33 site saturation (77.09%) was achieved at end of infusion (2 hour) on C1D1 where Cmax was observed. Similar results were seen at 2-hour post dose on Cycle 1 Day 4 (C1D4) and C1D7. Safety Results: Extent of Exposure: • 46 (92.0%) participants received all doses in Cycle 1. • 9 (18.0%) participants received Cycle 2, of which all 9 participants received all Cycle 2 doses.

The event was assessed as related to GO treatment by the investigator. Venoocclusive Disease/ Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome: No VOD/SOS events were reported as such by any participant during on-treatment and post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However 1 participant presented with capillary leak syndrome consistent with VOD/SOS. The participant did not receive any HSCT prior to study entry. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: No “TUMOUR LYSIS SYNDROME” TEAEs were reported Impact of Immunogenicity on Safety: • Of the 50 participants treated with GO, 44 were ADA negative and 6 had treatment- induced ADA. • 7 of 44 (15.9%) ADA negative participants had an “IRR”. • 2 of 6 (33.0%) treatment-induced ADA positive participants had an “IRR” of pyrexia. • None of the participants experienced anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity or other clinical sequelae related to ADA. Therefore, there is no evidence that the presence of ADA had a direct association of immunogenicity or any potential safety issues. Treatment-induced NAb was detected in 1 (2.0%) participant. This participant did not present any event meeting IRR. GO Permanent Discontinuations due to Adverse Events: TEAEs (all-causality) leading to discontinuation (withdrawal) of GO were reported in 2 (4.0%) participants. 1 (2.0%) participant had Grade 3 sepsis and 1 participant had Grade 4 pyrexia. There were no treatment-related TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation (withdrawal) of GO reported. Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events: • 45 (90.0%) participants died. The most common cause of death was reported as disease progression in 35 (77.8%) participants. 1 (2.2%) death was attributed to study treatment toxicity (capillary leak syndrome). • 6 (12.0%) participants died within 30 days of first dose of GO treatment. 5 (83.3%) participants died due to disease progression. • 13 (26.0%) participants died within 36 days after last dose of GO treatment. 9 (69.2%) participants died due to disease progression. • Grade 5 AEs were reported in 16 (32.0%) participants, of which 5 (10.0%) died of disease progression, 4 (8.0%) died of sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction, pyrexia, atypical pneumonia, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, AML (consistent with disease progression), respiratory failure, and capillary leak syndrome accounted for the deaths of the remaining participants. Clinical Laboratory Results: • A total of 43/50 (86.0%) participants experienced a hematology and coagulation parameter shift to Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline. The 3 most reported hematology and coagulation parameter postbaseline shifts to Grade 3 or 4 reported were white blood cell (WBC) decreased in 25/49 (51.0%), decreased lymphocyte count in • No prolonged cytopenia was experienced by any of the participants with CR/CRi in Cycle 1. Prolonged neutropenia (neutrophils <500/µL lasting past Day 42) was reported in 1/3 (33.3%) participants with CR/CRi in Cycle 2. • Among the 3 responders in Cycle 1, the median time to recovery of platelets to 50,000/µL was 32.0 days. Among all 3 responders in Cycle 2, the median time to recovery of platelets to 50,000/µL was 11.0 days. Among the 3 responders in Cycle 1, the median time to recovery of neutrophils to 500/µL was 32.0 days. Among all 3 responders in Cycle 2, the median time to recovery of neutrophils to 500/µL was 35.0 days. • A total of 18/50 (36.0%) participants experienced a chemistry laboratory shift to Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline. The 3 most reported chemistry laboratory shifts to Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline were hyperglycemia in 7/50 (14.0%), hyponatremia in 5/50 (10.0%), and hypokalemia in 4/50 (8.0%) participants. • No participants met the criteria for a potential Hy’s Law case (ie, concurrent ALT or AST ≥3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) <2 × ULN or missing). The overall incidence of ALT or AST values ≥3 × ULN was 6 participants, with 5 participants experiencing ALT ≥3 × ULN and 3 participants experiencing AST ≥3 × ULN). Electrocardiogram Results: • There were no participants who had a QTcF >480 msec or a QTcS >480 msec. • There were no participants with a maximum increase from baseline of QTcF or QTcS >60 msec. A maximum change in QTcF and QTcS between 30 and ≤60 msec was reported in 3 (6.1%) participants, each. • 11 (22.0%) participants exhibited a Grade 0 to Grade 1 shift in QTcF. 11 (22.0%) participants exhibited a Grade 0 to Grade 1 shift in QTcS. • No participants exhibited a Grade 3 or 4 event related to QTcF or QTcS (shift from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 on study). CONCLUSIONS Safety: The study met its primary endpoint demonstrating no evidence implicating the role of GO in prolongation of the of the change from baseline in QTc. The safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of fractionated regimen of GO. There were no direct evidences that the presence of ADA had a direct association with any potential safety issues following GO treatment. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Efficacy: The BOR based on CR+CRi was achieved in 5 (9.8%, 95% CI: 3.3, 21.4) participants. This result is lower than the OR of published data (MyloFrance 1, 33.3%), likely due to differences in the baseline characteristics in the study participants. Participants in this Study B1761031 included participants with prior HSCT and with multiple lines of prior therapy while the MyloFrance 1 included only participants in initial (first) relapse and excluded those participants with prior HSCT. Pharmacokinetics: In general, the PK profiles of both ac-CL-184538 and CL-184538 mirror that of total hP67.6 antibody following fractionated dosing regimen of GO. Pharmacodynamics: Following 3 mg/m2 GO administration, the highest median percent CD33 site saturation (77.09%) was achieved at end of infusion (2 hour) on C1D1 where C was observed. max Similar results were seen at 2-hour post dose on C1D4 and C1D7. Immunogenicity: The incidence of ADA and NAb is 12% and 2.0%, respectively. None of the participants experienced anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity or other clinical sequelae related to ADA.
