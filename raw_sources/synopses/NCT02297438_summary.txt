Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This was a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy and safety of palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole in Asian postmenopausal women with ER-positive/HER2-negative ABC. At least 330 participants were to be randomized 1:1 between the investigational arm (Arm A: at least 165 participants treated with palbociclib plus letrozole) and the comparator arm (Arm B: at least 165 participants treated with placebo plus letrozole). Among these approximately 330 participants, at least 264 participants were to be from China and the rest of the participants were from other Asian countries. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Eligible participants included adult Asian women (aged 18-70 years, inclusive) with proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast with evidence of locoregionally recurrent or metastatic disease not amenable to resection or radiation therapy with curative intent and for whom chemotherapy was not clinically indicated; with documentation of histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of ER positive breast cancer based on local laboratory results; previously untreated with any systemic anti-cancer therapy for their locoregionally recurrent or metastatic ER-positive disease. Study Treatment: Palbociclib/placebo was administered together with letrozole. Participants should have taken palbociclib/placebo with food. Palbociclib/placebo was administered orally once daily (QD) for 21 days of every 28-day cycle followed by 7 days off treatment. Letrozole was administered orally QD continuously together with palbociclib/placebo. Study drug information is provided in Table S2. Table S2.

Secondary efficacy endpoints:  PFS based on BICR assessment.  OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause.  OR was defined as the overall complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the RECIST version 1.1. Objective Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants with CR or PR relative to (1) all randomized participants and (2) randomized participants with measurable disease at baseline.  DOR was defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.  DC was defined as the overall CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) ≥24 weeks according to the RECIST version 1.1. DCR was defined as the proportion of participants with CR, PR, or SD ≥24 weeks relative to (1) all randomized participants and (2) randomized participants with measurable disease at baseline.  1-, 2- or 3-year survival probability was defined as the probability of survival 1 year, Pharmacokinetic (PK), Biomarker, and Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Evaluations: PK endpoint: trough plasma concentration of palbociclib. Biomarker endpoints: tumor tissue biomarkers, including genes, proteins and RNA expression. PRO: PROs of health-related QoL and health status were assessed using FACT-B (which included Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General [FACT-G]) and EQ-5D-3L (which included health state classifier and EQ-Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]) questionnaires. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring, vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure), electrocardiogram (ECGs), AEs, safety laboratory tests and ocular assessments. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: All efficacy analyses were based on intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Some efficacy analyses were also performed on the modified intent-to-treatment (mITT) and as treated (AT) populations. The primary and secondary analyses of endpoints dependent on disease assessments (PFS, OR, DOR, and DC/CBR) were based on investigator assessments of disease response and progression. However, a blinded independent third-party core imaging laboratory completed a retrospective review of radiographic images and clinical information collected on-study to verify the protocol defined endpoints of disease response and progression determinations as assessed by the investigator. PRO: The primary analysis set for the PRO endpoints was the ITT population. For each endpoint, a completion status table was provided showing the numbers and percentages of participants at each visit and the numbers and percentages of participants at that visit who completed none, at least one, or all of the items for that endpoint. PK: Individual and within-patient average palbociclib trough concentrations were listed by participant. Summary statistics were provided for trough concentrations by study cycle and for within-patient average trough concentrations by participant. Biomarker: The biomarker analyses were conducted on biomarker analysis set. For baseline continuous endpoint data, descriptive statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values, were provided by treatment arm. For baseline categorical data, the number and percentage of participants in each category were provided by treatment arm. Safety: All participants treated with at least 1 dose of study treatment (ie, palbociclib/placebo or letrozole) were included in all the safety analyses. The safety data were summarized and listed according to Sponsor’s reporting standard. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: There were 467 participants screened at 52 sites, as of the primary completion date (31 August 2020). A total of 340 participants were randomized. There were 168 and 171 participants treated with palbociclib plus letrozole and placebo plus letrozole, respectively (Table S3). The main reason for study treatment discontinuation from palbociclib or placebo was objective progression or relapse (Figure S1). Table S3.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Source Data: Table 16.2.1.1 Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 21JAN2021 Date of Table Generation: 02MAR2021 (04:37) Figure S1. Participant Disposition (End of Treatment - Palbociclib or Placebo) The demographic characteristics were generally well-balanced between the 2 treatment arms. The primary diagnosis was breast cancer. The median (range) duration of the disease under study since histopathological diagnosis was 4.2 (0.0 to 16.7) years for participants in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 4.6 (0.0 to 24.7) years for participants in the placebo plus letrozole arm. A total of 145 (85.8%) and 142 (83.0%) participants had measurable disease at baseline in the palbociclib plus letrozole and placebo plus letrozole arms, respectively. Baseline disease characteristics were generally well-balanced between the 2 treatment arms. All participants had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at baseline. Efficacy Results: Primary Efficacy Results: The final PFS analysis based on the investigator assessment for the ITT population was conducted based on the data as of the cutoff date of 31 August 2020 with 258 events (75.9%) observed (Table S4). The study met its primary objective which demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a clinically meaningful treatment effect in Asian postmenopausal women with ER-positive/HER2-negative ABC. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.677 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.529, 0.867; stratified 1-sided p-value=0.0012) in favor of palbociclib plus letrozole for the ITT population. The median PFS was 21.5 months (95% CI: 16.6, 24.9) for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 13.9 months (95% CI: 13.7, 16.6) for the placebo plus letrozole arm (Table S4). The median follow-up duration for PFS based on investigator assessment was 49.9 months (95% CI: 49.5, 55.1) in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and was 52.2 months (95% CI: 47.1, 55.1) in the placebo plus letrozole arm with a total median of 50.0 months for all randomized participants in the ITT population. A benefit in PFS outcome with the palbociclib plus letrozole arm, which was consistent with that reported in the overall population, was observed across most subgroups of randomization stratification factors.

No statistically significant differences were observed between treatment arms for mean changes from baseline for FACT-B or FACT-G total score or FACT-G subscales. No statistically significant differences for FACT-B Breast Cancer Subscale (BCS) were observed between treatment arms for most time points, except for visit at EOT. No statistically significant difference was observed in overall change from baseline trial outcome index scores between the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and the placebo plus letrozole arm. No statistically significant difference was observed in time to deterioration in FACT-B total scores between the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and the placebo plus letrozole arm The percentage of participants completing at least 1 question (EQ-5D completion rates) from baseline to EOT ranged from 88.9% to 100% in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 87.3% to 100% in the placebo plus letrozole arm. No statistically significant differences in change from baseline EQ-5D index scores were found between the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and the placebo plus letrozole arm. The mixed-effects model estimated change from baseline EQ-VAS scores on treatment showed a statistically significant difference in self-rated health favoring the palbociclib plus letrozole arm (estimated mean: 3.358, 95% CI: 0.88, 5.83, p=0.0078). Pharmacokinetic and Biomarker Results: PK Results: In the dose-compliant PK analysis population, the geometric mean steady-state within-patient average trough concentration was 80.2 ng/mL and the variability (geometric coefficients of variation [CV%]) of within-patient average plasma palbociclib trough plasma concentration (C ) was 36%. trough Biomarker Results: The median baseline % positive cells for Ki67 was 30.0% for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 27.5% for the placebo plus letrozole arm. Most participants (90.5% in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 94.7% in the placebo plus letrozole arm) had positive ER at baseline (central lab data). Safety Results: All 339 treated participants were evaluated for treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (Table S5). All 168 (100%) participants in the palbociclib plus letrozole and 155 (90.6%) participants in the placebo plus letrozole arm had at least 1 all-causality TEAE; 167 (99.4%) participants in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 123 (71.9%) participants in the placebo plus letrozole arm had at least 1 treatment-related TEAE.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Source Data: Table 16.2.7.1 Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 21JAN2021 Date of Table Generation: 16FEB2021 (00:05) In the palbociclib plus letrozole arm, 72.0% participants had Grade 3 AEs, 16.7% participants had Grade 4 AEs and 2.4% participants had Grade 5 AEs. In the placebo plus letrozole arm, 18.1% participants had Grade 3 AEs, 2.9% participants had Grade 4 AEs and 1.2% participants had Grade 5 AEs. No unexpected AE findings were observed based upon the known AE profile of palbociclib and letrozole. The most common (reported in ≥20% participants) all-causality TEAEs (by either CLUSTER or preferred term [PT]) in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm in decreasing frequency were NEUTROPENIA (98.2%), LEUKOPENIA (85.7%), THROMBOCYTOPENIA (48.8%), ANEMIA (45.8%), aspartate aminotransferases (AST) increased (34.5%), alanine aminotransferases (ALT) increased (33.3%), and INFECTIONS (31.0%). In the placebo plus letrozole arm, the most common (reported in ≥20% participants) all-causality TEAEs (by either CLUSTER or PT) in decreasing frequency were ALT increased (32.7%), INFECTIONS (31.0%) and AST increased (28.1%). In the palbociclib plus letrozole arm, a higher percentage of participants had maximum Grade 3, 4 and 5 all-causality TEAEs compared with the placebo plus letrozole arm (91.1% vs 22.2%), the most frequently reported maximum Grade 3 all-causality TEAEs (including either CLUSTER or PT) (≥10%) were NEUTROPENIA (72.0%), and LEUKOPENIA (35.7%). The most commonly reported maximum Grade 4 all--causality TEAE was NEUTROPENIA (12.5%). In the placebo plus letrozole arm, no Grade 3 or 4 all-causality TEAE with an incidence of ≥10% was reported. There were 4 and 2 Grade 5 all-causality TEAEs reported in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and placebo plus letrozole arm, respectively. As of the data cutoff date (31 August 2020), 79 deaths (All Causes) were reported in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 86 deaths (All Causes) were reported in the placebo plus letrozole arm. The most frequent cause of death was ‘Disease Under Study’. Most of the deaths occurred during the follow-up period (greater than 28 days after last dose): 74/79 deaths in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 82/86 deaths in the placebo plus letrozole arm. A higher percentage of participants in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm than in the placebo plus letrozole arm experienced at least 1 all-causality serious adverse event (SAE) (15.5% vs 9.4%). No all-causality SAEs were reported in ≥5% participants. In the palbociclib plus letrozole arm, the following hematology parameters had met the criteria of CTCAE grade shift change from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline in >5% participants: neutrophils (absolute; 85.1%), white blood cells (45.8%), platelets (7.7%) and anemia (6.0%). No shifts from CTCAE Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline in hematology parameters occurred in >5% participants in the placebo plus letrozole arm. In the palbociclib plus letrozole arm, the following chemistry parameters had met the criteria of CTCAE grade shift change from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline in >5% participants: ALT (5.4%), AST (5.4%), hypermagnesemia (6.0%) and hyponatremia (6.5%). No shifts from CTCAE Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline in chemistry parameters occurred in >5% participants in the placebo plus letrozole arm. No clinically significant differences between the 2 treatment arms were observed in vital signs or ECG data. Only 1 participant in the placebo plus letrozole arm had an increase from baseline of 10-25 mmHg for the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the right eye. No participants in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm had IOP increase >10 mmHg. Conclusions: Efficacy:  The study met its primary objective, demonstrating that palbociclib plus letrozole significantly prolonged PFS based on the investigator assessment compared to placebo plus letrozole in Asian postmenopausal women with ER-positive/HER2-negative ABC.  PFS based on investigator assessment subgroup analyses were consistent with the primary PFS outcome, and sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the primary PFS analysis.  As of the data cutoff date (31 August 2020), the secondary endpoints of PFS based on BICR assessment, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year survival probabilities, ORR, DOR and DC/CBR rate (per BICR assessment) showed numerical improvement in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm compared to the placebo plus letrozole arm. The differences did not reach statistical significance. The DC/CBR rates per investigator assessment were similar between the 2 arms.  A planned interim analysis of OS was performed, no OS conclusions can be made at the present time and study will continue follow-up for OS. PRO:  The addition of palbociclib to letrozole maintained breast cancer-specific health-related QoL and general health status. PK:  The geometric mean steady-state within-patient average trough concentration of palbociclib was 80.2 ng/mL. Biomarker:  The median baseline % positive cells for Ki67 was 30% for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 27.5% for the placebo plus letrozole arm.  Most participants (90.5% in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 94.7% in the placebo plus letrozole arm) had positive ER at baseline (central lab data). Safety:  Overall, palbociclib plus letrozole was safe and well-tolerated. No unexpected safety findings were observed.
