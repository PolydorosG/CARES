METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1, open label, multi-center, multiple-dose, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and immunogenicity study evaluating the components of VBIR-1. VBIR-1 consisted of the following components: Adenovirus (AdC68, PF-06755992), plasmid DNA (pDNA, PF-06755990), and tremelimumab (PF-06753388). In addition, cohorts evaluated VBIR-1 when given in combination with PF-06801591. The study was divided into 2 parts, Dose Escalation (Part A) followed by Dose Expansion (Part B). The overall design is presented in Figure S1 below. A cycle of the VBIR-1 included at minimum an AdC68 priming dose given intramuscularly on Day 1, followed by a total of 3 doses of DNA given intramuscularly at 4-week intervals for another 12 weeks (16 weeks total). Beginning with Cohort 3A, the VBIR-1 cycle also included tremelimumab given as subcutaneous (SC) injections at close proximity to the vaccinated muscles and the vaccine draining lymph nodes every 4 weeks at the immunization time points. For patients enrolled in Cohorts 6A through 9A and Cohorts 3B and 5B, the VBIR-1 cycle also included PF-06801591 given as SC injections at close proximity to the vaccinated muscles and the vaccine draining lymph nodes every 4 weeks at the immunization time points. After completing 2 cycles of treatment (approximately 8 months treatment duration), the patients then entered the maintenance phase of the study. The summarized changes and rationale of the study design from the original version to the final version are: A Cohort 9A was added in the protocol amendment 5 (dated 17 Aug 2017) and was inserted before the originally scheduled Cohort 6A. Cohorts 4A and 8A were removed in the protocol amendment 7 (dated 22 Nov 2019) because safety data emerged in those cohorts with the dose level of tremelimumab 150 mg and a lower dose with a better tolerability profile was considered more beneficial. The original Cohort 5A was removed in the protocol amendment 7 as Sunitinib was no longer to be tested with the VBIR-1 regimen. Figure S1. Overall Study Design a. RN888 refers to PF-06801591 and treme refers to tremelimumab.

(White/White) Bottle Efficacy Evaluations: Tumor assessments included all known or suspected disease sites. Anti-tumor activity was assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline, during treatment as specified, whenever disease progression was suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the time of withdrawal from treatment (if not done in the previous 6 weeks). Assessment of response was made using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, and Immune-Related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria for bone disease. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Immunogenicity Evaluations: Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Blood samples (approximately 3 mL whole blood) to provide at least 1 mL of serum for measurement of serum tremelimumab concentrations were collected from patients enrolled into Cohorts 3A or later at the time points specified. Blood samples (approximately 5 mL) to provide serum for the analysis of PF-06801591 concentrations were collected from patients enrolled into Cohorts 6A through 9A or Dose Expansion Cohorts 3B and 5B at the time points specified. PK samples were assayed for tremelimumab and PF-06801591 using a validated analytical method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures. Pharmacodynamic Evaluations: Blood samples were obtained at the timepoints specified for biomarker evaluations performed on peripheral blood. Samples were analyzed using cellular and serological immune assays to assess the induction of specific immune responses to the treatment, as well as cell-based assays to determine the reduction of immune-suppressive cells and tumor cells in circulation by the treatment. Immunogenicity Evaluations: Blood samples (approximately 5 mL) to provide at least 2 mL of serum to detect anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (Nab) against tremelimumab (~1 mL each of ADA and Nab) were collected from patients enrolled in to (approximately 5 mL) to provide at least 2 mL of serum for detection of ADA and Nab against PF-06801591 (~1 mL each for ADA and Nab) were collected from patients enrolled in Cohorts 6A to 9A and Cohorts 3B and 5B into appropriately labeled tubes at times specified. Samples were analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures. Safety Evaluations: Safety assessments included collection of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), vital signs and physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG [12 lead]), laboratory assessments, and verification of concomitant treatments. Statistical Methods: Efficacy Tumor response, using RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST, was a secondary efficacy endpoint for Part B. The following analyses were performed based on modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population: 1. Tumor response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], progressive disease [PD], etc.) by cohort and visit, separately for RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST. Investigator provided tumor response was presented by descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage). 2. Best overall response (BOR), by cohort, across all available tumor assessments from both treatment period and maintenance period, separately for RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST. BOR was derived programmatically. In the tabular data presentation, a row of CR + PR was added to show the results of objective response rate (ORR). Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) were provided. Selected ad-hoc efficacy analyses (eg, ORR and radiographic progression free survival [rPFS]) combining patients from Cohorts 7A and 3B were conducted, as patients in those two cohorts had identical or similar eligibility criteria for study entry and were scheduled to receive the same regimen. Radiographic PFS was defined as time from start date of treatment to the date of first documentation of progression of disease either by PCWG3 defined bone progression, or RECIST, or death due to any cause, whichever came first. rPFS was an endpoint including RECIST and bone imaging per PCWG3. For duration of response per RECIST and PCWG3 and time to response (from the first vaccination date to the time of the first response, CR or PR) in Part B, descriptive statistics were provided. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed. These analyses were performed for the combined cohorts 7A and 3B. Pharmacokinetics The concentration-time data of tremelimumab and PF-06801591 were presented as below:  a listing of all concentrations by cohort, patient identification (ID) and nominal time for each compound. The concentration listings also included the actual times. Deviations from the nominal time were given in a separate listing for each compound.  a summary of concentrations for each compound by cohort and nominal time, where the set of statistics included n, mean, standard deviation, median, coefficient of variation (cv), minimum, maximum and the number of concentrations above the lower limit of quantification.  for the concentration-time data after the first dose, the median concentrations versus against nominal time postdose were plotted by cohort on both linear and semi log scales (all cohorts on the same plot per scale) for tremelimumab (Cohorts 3A and 4A only) and PF-06801591 (Cohorts 6A through 9A). For drug concentration summary statistics, median and mean plots by nominal PK sampling time and by cohort were used. Pharmacodynamics PD analyses were performed for the time course data of immune response endpoints including antibody titers against prostate cancer specific antigens and antigen-specific T cells, if data permitted. For patients from dosing cohorts involving treatment with tremelimumab, PD analyses were also conducted to investigate association between drug exposure and PD endpoints (eg, immune responses, prostate specific antigen [PSA], myeloid derived suppressor cell [MDSC], circulating tumor cells [CTCs], significant safety endpoints), where available. PSA-50 response rate was defined as the proportion of patients whose on-study PSA declined from baseline by at least 50% at 2 consecutive measurements at least 3 weeks apart, prior to other systematic anti-cancer therapy. For the subset of PSA-50 responders, a duration of PSA-50 response was summarized. Duration of PSA-50 response was defined as the period between the first measurement when PSA-50 response was achieved to the measurement when PSA-50 response no longer held. Immunogenicity For patients receiving tremelimumab or PF-06801591, the percentage of patients with positive ADA was summarized by cohort, patient population (BCR and metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer [mCRPC]), dose levels (40 mg and 80 mg for tremelimumab and 130 mg and 300 mg for PF-06801591). For patients with positive ADA, the magnitude (titer), time of onset, and duration of ADA response (persistent ADA, transient ADA and indeterminate ADA) were also described, if data permitted. Incidence and titers of neutralizing antibodies against tremelimumab were not analyzed as the study was terminated. Safety DLT was a primary endpoint of the study and were analyzed based on the Per Protocol (PP) analysis set. Adverse events and adverse events constituting DLTs were listed per dose level (ie, by cohort). A summary table was created by cohort to present number and percentage of patients experiencing DLT and each specific adverse event constituting DLT. AEs were graded by the investigator according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 4.03 and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). AE, SAE, treatment related AE (TRAE), treatment related SAE were presented by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for each cohort. Severity summary tables were also presented where AE, SAE, TRAE, and treatment related SAE were presented for each cohort by SOC and PT according to the worst toxicity grade. The secondary endpoints included laboratory tests abnormalities and ECG were analyzed according to the Pfizer Data Standard. The number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities were summarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each laboratory test. Immune-related AEs (irAEs) were summarized as a post hoc analysis in which irAEs were identified by a medical review and an independent adjudication process on the Case Report Form (CRF) reported AEs data. These AEs were defined as immune-related, based on the need for immunosuppressive therapy, or endocrine replacement therapy. In addition, the definition of irAE also required that no alternative clinical explanation for the AE could be found, other than immune-related. A summary table was created by each pre-specified irAE category, MedDRA PT, and maximum CTCAE Grade to present number and percentage of patients experiencing irAEs.

Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Immunogenicity Results: Pharmacokinetic PF-06801591 Pharmacokinetics Following the combination therapy in Cohorts 6A, 7A, and 9A, geometric mean maximum serum concentration (C ) of PF-06801591 in Cohorts 6A, 7A and 9A were 8507, 19960, max and 8899 ng/mL, respectively. PF-06801591 C were observed at 67 to 380 hours after max subcutaneous (SC) administrations, and the median time to maximum concentration (T ) max for Cohorts 6A, 7A, and 9A were 164, 188, 166 hours, respectively. Geometric mean area under the serum concentration-time profile from time zero to 672 hours (AUC ) for 672 PF-06801591 was 4163000, 10250000 and 4645000 ng•hr/mL respectively for Cohorts 6A, 7A, and 9A in which PF-06801591 130, 300 and 130 mg SC were administered. Geometric mean area under the serum concentration-time profile from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC ) was 4095000 and 10370000 ng•hr/mL for Cohorts 6A last and 7A respectively while AUC for 3 patients (1 patient each in Cohorts 6A, 7A and 9A) last were excluded from summaries as the values were based on nominal 504H sample. It should be noted that area under the serum concentration-time profile from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC ), apparent clearance (CL/F) and half-life (t ) could not be reported due to the inf ½ lack of a well-characterized terminal phase for all profiles. In Part B, geometric mean accumulation ratios based on the trough concentration (C ), trough prior to the 5th and 2nd dose for PF-06801591 ranged from 0.2558 to 1.425 across all treatments, indicating a high variability in the observed accumulation ratio for Ctrough (R ). ac,Ctrough Variability in exposure based on geometric percent coefficient of variation (%CV) ranged Tremelimumab Pharmacokinetics Following combination therapy in Cohort 3A in which tremelimumab 80 mg SC were administered, geometric mean C of tremelimumab was 4360 ng/mL. The median T was max max 307 hours after the SC administration. Geometric mean AUC and AUC for 672 last tremelimumab was 2389000 and 242300 ng•hr/mL respectively for Cohort 3A when 80 mg tremelimumab was subcutaneously administered. It should be noted that AUC , CL/F and t inf ½ could not be reported due to the lack of a well-characterized terminal phase for all profiles. In Part B, geometric mean accumulation ratios based on C (R ) for tremelimumab trough ac,Ctrough ranged between 1.331 to 1.643 across all treatments. Variability in exposure based on geometric %CV ranged from 32%-34% for AUC (AUClast and AUC ), and 31% for C . 672 max Pharmacodynamic T Cell Immune Response T cell response to ≥1 antigen (prostate-specific membrane antigen [PSMA], prostate stem cell antigen [PSCA] and prostate specific antigen [PSA]) were seen in all patients across cohorts assessed in BCR and mCRPC. PSA-50 Response Rate and Duration of Response In Part B, 5 (25.0%) patients in Cohort 1B had a 50% reduction in PSA from baseline (PSA-50) (associated with Grade 1 hypopituitarism in 1 patient) with median (range) duration of local PSA-50 response of 10.1 (6.9-28.8) months, 2 (11.1%) patients in Cohort 3B had a 50% reduction in PSA from baseline with median (range) duration of local PSA-50 response of 3.4 (1.2-5.6) months, and 4 (26.7%) patients in Cohort 5B had a 50% reduction in PSA from baseline with median (range) duration of local PSA-50 response of 3.9 (1.9-4.2) months. Immunogenicity Immunogenicity Response to Tremelimumab Eighty-four patients were evaluable for tremelimumab immunogenicity. Among the 84 patients, 1 (1.2%) patient was ADA positive at baseline and was not treatment-boosted; 17 (20.2%) patients tested positive for ADA after initiation of tremelimumab treatment. Among the 17 patients with treatment-induced ADA, the number of patients with persistent ADA, transient ADA, and indeterminate ADA was 6 (35.3%), 11 (64.7%), and 0 (0%), respectively. The median time to first ADA detection was 84 days, with the range of 27 to 539 days. In patients with tremelimumab treatment induced ADA, the median of the maximal titer was 2.68, with the inter-quantile range of 2.22 to 2.86. The overall ADA incidence was incidence was 33.3% (1/3) among the patients in Cohort 9A who received 40 mg tremelimumab, and 19.8% (16/81) among the patients in combined cohorts of 3A, 6A, 7A, 1B, 3B, and 5B who received 80 mg tremelimumab. There was no apparent effect of ADA on tremelimumab exposure, safety, and efficacy. Nab to tremelimumab was not examined due to business reason. The impacts of Nab on PK, efficacy and safety were expected to be minimal because ADA incidence was not high and ADA had minimal impacts on PK, efficacy and safety. Immunogenicity response to PF-06801591 Fifty-eight patients were evaluable for PF-06801591 immunogenicity. Among the 58 patients, 6 tested positive for ADA against PF-06801591 at baseline, and 13 had either treatment-induced (11) or treatment boosted ADA (2). Among 13 patients with either treatment-induced or treatment boosted ADA, the number of patients with persistent ADA, transient ADA, and indeterminate ADA duration was 4 (30.8%), 7 (53.8%), and 2 (15.4%), respectively. The median time to first ADA detection was 142 days, with the range of 28 to 406 days. The median of the maximal ADA titer was 1430.0, with the inter-quantile range of 790.0 to 7520.0. The incidence was 53.3% (8/15) and 11.6% (5/43) in patients with BCR and mCRPC, respectively. The incidence was 9.4% (3/32) among the patients in Cohort 7A and 3B Combined who received 300 mg PF-06801591 and 38.5% (10/26) among the patients in combined cohorts of 6A, 9A, and 5B who received 130 mg PF-06801591. There was no substantial effect of ADA on PF-06801591 exposure, safety, and efficacy. Nab to PF-06801591 was not examined due to business reason. The impacts of Nab on PK, efficacy, and safety were expected to be minimal because ADA incidence was not high and ADA had minimal impacts on PK, efficacy and safety.

In Part B, 1 (2.2%) patient had PR interval ≥300 msec, 1 (2.2%) patient had QRS complex ≥140 msec, 2 (4.4%) patients had QTcF interval between 450 to 480 msec, and 2 (4.4%) patients had QTcF interval between 480 to 500 msec; 1 (2.3%) patient had PR interval increase from baseline ≥25/50%, 1 (2.2%) patient had QRS complex increase from baseline ≥50%, and 2 (4.4%) patients had QTcF increase from baseline ≥30 - 60 msec. TEAEs of ECG abnormal (Cohort 7A) and heart rate irregular (Cohort 9A) were reported in 1 patient each in Part A. Conclusions: Efficacy  Patients with mCRPC had minimal objective tumor responses; some patients experienced prolonged median rPFS.  Of the 32 mCRPC patients in Cohort 7A and 3B Combined, 18 (56.3%) had measurable disease at baseline. The ORR for the subset of 18 patients was 16.7% (95% CI: 3.6%, 41.4%).  Of the 32 mCRPC patients in Cohort 7A and 3B Combined, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of median rPFS based on RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 (for bone) was 5.6 (95% CI: 2.0, NE) months. The rPFS rate was 45.5% (95% CI: 24.9%, 64.1%) at PD  T cell response to ≥1 antigen (PSMA, PSCA and PSA) were seen in all patients across cohorts assessed in BCR and mCRPC.  Of the 35 patients with BCR (Cohorts 1B and 5B), 9 experienced local PSA-50 responses, regardless of whether they received 1 or 2 ICIs on the VBIR-1 regimen. PK  Following combination therapy in Cohort 6A, 7A, and 9A in which PF-06801591 130, 300 and 130 mg SC were administered, median T of PF-06801591 was 164 to max 188 hours, geometric mean AUC for PF-06801591 was 4163000, 10250000 and 672 4645000 ng•hr/mL respectively for Cohort 6A, 7A, and 9A. In Part B, geometric mean R ranged from 0.2558 to 1.425 across all treatments. ac,Ctrough  Following combination therapy in Cohort 3A in which tremelimumab 80 mg SC were administered, median T of tremelimumab was 307 hours, geometric mean AUC for max 672 tremelimumab was 2389000 ng•hr/mL. In Part B, geometric mean R ranged from ac,Ctrough 1.331 to 1.643 across all treatments. Immunogenicity  Following SC administration, tremelimumab in the dose range of 40 to 80 mg and PF-0681591 in the dose range of 130 to 300 mg, immunogenicity risk was minimal. Development of ADA was not associated with any apparent impact on PK, efficacy, and safety. Safety  Increasing dose levels of the VBIR-1 components alone and in combination with increasing doses of PF-06801591 were generally safe and with manageable toxicities in prostate cancer patients.  One patient in Cohort 6A had DLTs of Grade 4 myositis and Grade 3 myasthenia gravis.  The most common TRAEs were fatigue (37 patients, 40.7%), influenza like illness (28 patients, 30.8%), and diarrhea (21 patients, 23.1%). Grade 3 or 4 TRAEs developed in 42.9% (39/91) of patients. Grade 5 TRAEs occurred in 2 patients (1 pulmonary embolism, and 1 immune-mediated myocarditis).  High-grade TRAEs (Grade ≥3) were more common in BCR patients with 2 ICIs (66.7%, Cohort 5B) vs 1 ICI (30.0%, Cohort 1B).  Immune-related AEs were observed in 39 (42.9%) patients including 16 (17.6%) most common irAEs by category occurring in >5% patients were immune-related thyroid disorders (18, 19.8%), immune-related rash (14, 15.4%), and immune-related colitis (13, 14.3%).  High-grade irAEs (Grade ≥3) were more common in BCR patients with 2 ICIs (46.7%, Cohort 5B) vs 1 ICI (5.0%, Cohort 1B).
