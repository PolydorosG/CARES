Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints (Expansion Cohorts) METHODS Study Design: This multi-center, open-label Phase 1b study was designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of glasdegib when combined with azacitidine in patients with previously untreated Higher-Risk MDS, AML, and CMML. The Phase 1b study included 2 components: (a) a safety LIC, and (b) an expansion phase with 2 cohorts (Figure S1). Figure S1. Schematic of Study Design *MDS patients enrolled in the Safety Lead-In component must have Intermediate-2 or High-Risk disease per International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). **MDS patients enrolled in the Expansion component must have Intermediate, High, or Very High risk disease per International Prognostic Scoring System Revised Classification (IPSS-R). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: In the safety LIC, patients with previously untreated Intermediate 2 or High-Risk MDS per IPSS, AML with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, erythroleukemia, and CMML were enrolled. In the expansion cohorts, patients with previously untreated Intermediate, High, or Very High risk MDS per IPSS-R, CMML or patients with AML who were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy were enrolled. Study Treatment: Both study drugs were administered in 28-day cycles. Glasdegib was self-administered by the patient at home, unless otherwise specified. It was administered orally with approximately 8 ounces (240 mL) of water and should have been taken in the morning, at the same time each day. Safety LIC  Azacitidine was administered SC daily at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day on Days 1-7 (every 28 days). No other dosing schedule was permitted.  Glasdegib was orally administered daily and continuously. In Cycle 1 only, administration of glasdegib commenced on Day 2 of the cycle (C1D2) to permit drug-drug interaction (DDI) evaluation. The starting dose was 100 mg. Expansion Cohorts  Azacitidine was administered per local label or per the Investigational Product Manual (or summary of product characteristics [SPC]). Azacitidine was administered by SC injection or IV infusion at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days every 28 days. Alternate dosing schedules to administer the 7 doses to accommodate patient and treatment center availability were allowed.  Glasdegib was orally administered daily and continuously. The starting dose was 100 mg. The investigational product description is provided in Table S3. Glasdegib was supplied by Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development as 25 mg and 100 mg tablets for oral administration. Azacitidine 25 mg/mL powder for suspension for injection was used in this study. Table S3.

The 2017 European Leukemia Net (ELN) Response Criteria were applied to all AML patients in the expansion cohort. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Glasdegib (Safety LIC and Expansion) Blood samples (1.5 mL whole blood sufficient to provide a minimum of 0.6 mL of plasma) were collected for PK analysis of glasdegib. Glasdegib samples were assayed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC/MS/MS) method. Blood samples (2 mL whole blood sufficient to provide a minimum of 1 mL of plasma) were collected for PK analysis of azacitidine (and possibly metabolites). Azacitidine samples were assayed using a validated HPLC/MS/MS method. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring, vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), AEs and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: Primary Endpoints (expansion cohorts): The proportion and two-sided 95% CI of patients achieving CR were provided separately for the 2 expansion cohorts. Secondary Endpoints: LIC: The proportion and two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) (using exact method) of patients achieving response (CR+PR) were provided for the safety LIC. Expansion cohorts:  OS was analyzed and displayed graphically for each expansion cohort separately using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median event time for each expansion cohort and corresponding two-sided 95% CI were provided. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival probabilities at 6, 12, and 18 months and their two-sided 95% CI (using log-log transformation and back-transformation) were provided for each arm separately.  Duration of response (DoR) was defined as the duration from date of first achieving CR to the date of disease progression (relapse) after CR, or death due to any cause. DoR was analyzed and displayed graphically for each expansion cohort separately using the Kaplan Meier method. The median DoR and corresponding two-sided 95% CI were provided.  Time to response (TTR) was only defined for patients in the expansion component who had ever achieved response on study as the time from date of the first dose of study drug to date of the first documentation of response (CR+PR). TTR was analyzed and displayed graphically for each cohort separately using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median TTR and corresponding two-sided 95% CI were provided. PK: Descriptive statistics were provided for the following PK parameters in tabular form by analyte, cycle and day: n, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and its associated CV. For the safety LIC, standard plasma PK parameters including C , T , and AUC for each max max drug (and metabolite if relevant), were estimated using non-compartmental analysis. For drug concentrations, individual values and descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, CV, median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) were presented by cycle, day of assessment, and nominal time in tabular form. For the safety LIC, individual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data were plotted by dose, cycle and day using nominal times. Median profiles were presented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales. The primary PK parameters, AUC and C , were utilized to estimate the effect of max co-administration of glasdegib and azacitidine on the PK of either glasdegib or azacitidine. These endpoints were not applicable in the expansion component. Glasdegib AUC and C when administered alone (Cycle 1/Day 15) were compared to max Cycle 1/Day 7 AUC and C , when administered in combination with azacitidine. A similar max assessment was performed to determine the effect of glasdegib on azacitidine. The AUC and C on Cycle 1 Day 1 when azacitidine was administered alone were compared to maxCycle 1/Day 7 AUC and C when azacitidine was administered in combination with max glasdegib. Safety: Summary and analysis of the safety parameters included all patients in the safety analysis set. They were reported separately for the safety LIC and each cohort in the expansion.

Pharmacokinetic Results: LIC All 12 patients treated with glasdegib in the LIC were included in the PK analysis. All 12 patients provided PK concentration data for glasdegib and azacitidine. For the DDI assessment, PK parameters were available for all 12 patients for azacitidine on both C1D1 and C1D7 visits except AUC (11/12 for both visits). For glasdegib, PK inf parameters were available for all 12 patients for C1D7, and for 9/12 patients for C1D15. The PK parameters for glasdegib and azacitidine when dosed alone (C1D1 for azacitidine; C1D15 for glasdegib) and in combination (C1D7) are summarized in Table S7 and Table S8. There was no evidence of change in PK (AUC and C ) of either glasdegib or azacitidine max when dosed in combination. AML Cohort A total of 31 patients were enrolled with 30 treated in the AML cohort. For glasdegib, all 30 patients provided glasdegib plasma concentration data. On C1D15 and C2D1, 25 and 17 patients, respectively, provided a pre-dose PK concentration considered to be dose compliant for the estimation of the lowest concentration before next dose administration (C ) parameter (at least 4 days of daily glasdegib dosing prior to collection of the PK trough sample to ensure patients were at steady state of glasdegib dosing). For the dose compliant patients, the geometric mean (geometric percent coefficient of variation [%CV]) value for glasdegib plasma C on C1D15 was 468 ng/mL (88%) and for trough C2D1 was 463 ng/mL (110%) respectively. MDS Cohort A total of 30 patients were treated in the MDS cohort. For glasdegib, all 30 patients provided glasdegib plasma concentration data. On C1D15 and C2D1, 22 and 18 patients respectively, provided a pre-dose PK concentration considered to be dose compliant for the estimation of the C parameter (at least 4 days of daily glasdegib dosing prior to collection of the PK trough sample to ensure patients were at steady state of glasdegib dosing). For the dose compliant subjects, the geometric mean (geometric %CV) value for glasdegib plasma C on C1D15 was 308 ng/mL (95%) and for C2D1 was 167 ng/mL (52%) trough respectively.

Conclusions: Addition of glasdegib to azacitidine in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AML or MDS has an acceptable safety profile and resulted in clinical benefits.  In context of the patient population and duration of follow-up, response results and survival data of the AML and MDS cohorts appeared at least comparable with what has been reported for azacitidine monotherapy.  In the AML and MDS cohorts, the safety profile was manageable and consistent with what has been previously reported for glasdegib in combination with chemotherapy (cytarabine/daunorubicin, low dose cytarabine [LDAC], or decitabine), namely gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, cytopenias, and infection complications.  Frequencies of smoothened inhibitor (SMOi) class-specific AEs (Muscle spasms, Dysgeusia, Ageusia, Taste disorder, Alopecia) were consistent with what has been previously reported in the glasdegib program and for other SMOi.  There was no evidence of change in exposure (AUC and C ) of either glasdegib or max azacitidine when dosed in combination, indicating lack of DDI potential. The data support further study with glasdegib in combination with azacitidine in MDS.
