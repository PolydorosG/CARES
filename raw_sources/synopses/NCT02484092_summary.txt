Study Initiation Date: 18 November 2015 Study Completion Date: Last Subject Last Visit (LSLV): 08 April 2019 Report Date: 20 May 2020 Previous Report Date: 28 August 2019 Phase of Development: Phase 1/2a Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: The primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are presented in Table S1. Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1/2a, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation and multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and kinetics of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of SPK-9001 in hemophilia B participants with 2 IU/dL (2%) endogenous factor IX (FIX) levels. A total of 15 evaluable participants were initially planned to be dosed with a single IV infusion of SPK-9001 at one of 3 different dose levels. Participants provided informed consent and then underwent screening assessments up to 6 (2) weeks prior to SPK-9001 infusion on the Dosing Day (Day 0 visit). All dosed participants underwent safety observation for a total of 52 (2) weeks after SPK-9001 infusion. The administration of SPK-9001 to the first 2 participants in the starting dose level was planned to be staggered by at least 2 weeks to ensure safety. Additionally, at least 8 weeks of safety data from at least 3 out of 5 participants in a given dose level underwent review by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) prior to dosing the first participant in the next dose level. The decision to dose escalate required the agreement of the Sponsor and the DMC. Based on observed safety and efficacy data in the first 5 participants at the initial dose of 5 × 1011 vg/kg, DMC recommended to enroll 10 additional participants (15 participants in total) at that dose level and to not escalate the dose. This decision was not due to safety reasons. These 15 participants completed the study. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Eligible patients were male and 18 years of age and had hemophilia B with 2 IU/dL (2 %) endogenous FIX activity levels as documented by a certified clinical laboratory at the time of screening. All patients had to have 50 prior exposure days (EDs) to any recombinant and/or plasma-derived FIX protein products based on historical data from the participant’s record/history and no measurable FIX inhibitor as assessed by the central laboratory; or documented no prior history of FIX inhibitor after 50 EDs (family history of inhibitors did not exclude the participant) and no clinical signs or symptoms of decreased response to FIX administration. Participants previously on prophylaxis treatment had to have bleeding events and/or infusions with FIX protein products during the last 12 weeks documented in the participants’ medical records; participants previously on on-demand treatment had to have 4 bleeding events in the last 52 weeks and/or chronic hemophilic arthropathy (pain, joint destruction, and loss of range of motion) in 1 or more joints. Study Treatment: Participants were required to have washout of at least 96 hours (4 days) for FIX protein product, or up to approximately 168 hours (7 days) of washout for extended half-life FIX protein product, prior to any blood draw and infusion at Day 0 visit. At Day 0 visit, participants were infused with 100 IU/kg of their usual FIX protein product over 10 (2) minutes, under the supervision from the site staff and/or investigator(s) to assess FIX incremental recovery. Number of vials, total volume, and total dosage were monitored and recorded by the site staff. Following the bolus infusion of the usual FIX protein product, the participant was infused with SPK-9001 intravenously for approximately 60 minutes via infusion pump. The rate of administration was determined based on the total volume of the SPK-9001 required for the participant to infuse for approximately 60 minutes.

All efficacy analyses were exploratory in nature. Vector-derived circulating FIX (FIX:C) activity levels (including peak and steady-state levels), FIX antigen level, annualized bleed rate (spontaneous and traumatic), annualized FIX consumption, number of target joints, changes in level of activity, health-related quality-of-life, health-economic parameters were collected for exploratory efficacy evaluations. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Pharmacokinetics FIX transgene expression (plasma FIX activity) was monitored twice weekly or thrice-weekly in Weeks 1-8, and once in Weeks 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22, 26, 32, 42 and 52. Plasma FIX activity levels were analyzed and used to determine peak and steady-state vector-derived circulating FIX activity levels. Spare plasma, from already collected blood samples, was stored for repeat or additional tests. FIX incremental recovery was measured up to 24 (1) hours post-infusion of FIX protein products to assess time at maximum activity (T ) and percent recovery for exogenous FIX max activity. FIX incremental recovery was calculated using the peak factor level recorded within the first 3 hours after infusion. Blood samples at Day 0 visit were collected pre-infusion, 10 (2) minutes, 1 hour 10 minutes, 3 hours 10 minutes, 6 hours 10 minutes, and 24 (1) hours from the start of infusion of FIX protein product. All blood samples collected from participants for plasma FIX activity levels and FIX incremental recovery were analyzed at a certified clinical laboratory by 1-stage assay. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs) and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Pharmacokinetics The analysis of peak FIX:C activity utilized summary descriptive statistics and individual participant listings and FIX activity graphs were presented and summarized for all vector-derived FIX:C activities by scheduled time-point. FIX:C activity versus time was plotted for each participant. Steady-state geometric means were calculated for each individual and summarized for the whole group. Blood samples for FIX incremental recovery were collected pre-infusion of the FIX protein product and at least 1 sample within 3 hours post infusion. FIX activity-time data along with the FIX antigen data were presented in listings and summarized in a table. Incremental recovery was determined as the peak factor level recorded within the first 3 hours after infusion and was reported as (IU/ml)/(IU/kg), using the formula: ([Activity IU/mL peak post infusion] – [Activity IU/mL pre-infusion]) / (IU/kg infused). Safety AEs were classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ classes (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs). MedDRA version 21.1 was used throughout the study. An AE was regarded as treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) if the start date was on or after the infusion of SPK-9001 but before participant’s last visit on study (or the date of withdrawal/the date of being lost to follow-up). All AEs, including serious AEs (SAEs), were presented in data listings. Summaries of the total number of TEAEs, the number of participants with at least 1 TEAE and the incidence were presented. The number of participants, the number of events and the incidence were also presented by SOC and PT. A summary of TEAEs by relationship to study drug, severity and toxicity grade was presented in a table, respectively. For laboratory evaluations, baseline was defined as the last non-missing evaluable assessment taken prior to SPK-9001 infusion. Post-baseline laboratory results were defined as any assessment taken after the infusion of SPK-9001. Laboratory assessments were performed by a certified laboratory. All summaries were based on the units provided by the central laboratory; conversion for the local laboratories was performed to make the units consistent with the central laboratory results. Summary tables used central laboratory results. Both central and local results were included in listings. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: Participant disposition is summarized in Table S3. A total of 22 participants signed the informed consent form, and 15 of these participants received treatment. Seven (7) participants did not participate in the study due to screen failure. All 15 participants completed the study. All baseline and safety analyses presented in this report were based on the safety analysis set, which included all participants who received the infusion of SPK-9001. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) duration on study was 367.7 (6.41) days, ranging from 358 to 380 days. All 15 participants were male with the mean age of 38.6 years, ranging from 18 to 61 years. The majority of participants were ≥35 years (10 [66.7%]) and White or Caucasian (12 [80.0%]). Table S3.

Steady-state FIX:C activity in all participants was above 5% of normal after infusion of SPK-9001 overall and the steady-state levels were reached by approximately Week 12. The mean steady-state FIX:C was 22.9% of normal, ranging from 9% to 46%, which were within the mild range. One (1 [6.7%]) participant reached steady-state FIX:C activity level ≥40% of normal. The mean peak FIX:C activity during the 52-week follow-up was 29.1% of normal, ranging from 11% to 58%. Table S4.

Washout: 96 hours (4 days) washout for pd- or rFIX (or up to 168 hours [7 days] washout for extended half-life rFIX). Pharmacokinetic Results: FIX Incremental Recovery The mean (SD) incremental recovery of FIX product was 0.0100 (0.00242) (IU/ml)/(IU/kg) at Day 0 visit, ranging from 0.004 to 0.013. The mean (SD) incremental recovery of FIX product was 0.0162 (0.01351) (IU/ml)/(IU/kg) at Week 52 visit, ranging from 0.010 to 0.044. Safety Results: Fourteen (14, 93.3%) out of 15 participants had at least 1 TEAE reported. Two (2) participants reported 1 study drug-related TEAE each. There was no study drug discontinuation, study discontinuation, SAEs or deaths reported in the study. A total of 81 TEAEs were reported in the study. The majority of TEAEs (53/81) were mild in severity, and the other 28 TEAEs were moderate in severity. The most commonly reported TEAEs, regardless of causality, were in the SOCs of infections and infestations (8 participants, 53.3%), gastrointestinal disorders (7 participants, 46.7%) and musculoskeletal and connective disorders (6 participants, 40.0%). The most frequently reported TEAEs, regardless of causality, were upper respiratory tract infection (5 participants, 33.3%), nasopharyngitis (3 participants, 20.0%), back pain (3 participants, 20.0%) and muscle strain (3 participants, 20.0%). Two (2) participants experienced a moderate drug-related TEAE of transaminases increased, one of whom demonstrated a suggested immune T-cell reaction as observed by positive ELISPOT around the time of transaminases elevation. A tapering course of prednisolone (oral corticosteroid) was initiated in response to the increased transaminases and presumed immune T-cell reaction. Both TEAEs resolved following treatment with corticosteroids. A third participant also experienced elevated transaminases and was treated with corticosteroids. This participant had an associated positive ELISPOT suggesting a T-cell reaction to capsid protein during the interval from 4 to 10 weeks after SPK-9001 infusion. Among the remainder of 79 TEAEs, 77 TEAEs were considered not related to study drug by the investigator and 2 TEAEs (gastrooesophageal reflux disease and muscle injury) unlikely related to study drug. The majority of participants remained generally normal for most hematology and chemistry parameters during the study. One (1) participant experienced 1 moderate TEAE of normocytic anaemia and 1 mild TEAE of microcytic anaemia with low normal levels of erythrocytes, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), hematocrit, and hemoglobin, as well as high normal levels of erythrocytes distribution width reported. Both TEAEs were considered not related to study drug by the investigator. No action was taken in response to the events. The TEAEs resolved during the study. No clinically significant or study drug-related findings in vital signs were noted. There were isolated findings noted in the skin, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and other body systems for some participants, which were listed as clinically significant by the investigator. The majority of these findings were baseline hemophilic arthropathy, arthropathy and decreased joint range of motion, which were related to the participants underlying hemophilia. Otherwise, there were no physical examination changes post-vector infusion that were clinically significant and/or related to the study drug. Conclusions:  Based on 1-year follow-up of 15 moderately severe-to-severe hemophilia B participants, SPK-9001 infusion at the 5 × 1011 vg/kg dose level was shown to be generally well-tolerated with no notable safety findings.  Three (3) participants were noted to have elevations in transaminases and were treated with corticosteroids. Two (2) of these participants had positive ELISPOTs to capsid protein suggesting a T-cell mediated response to hepatocytes. LFTs normalized in all 3 cases after initiation of corticosteroids.  Steady-state FIX:C activity in all participants was above 5% of normal after infusion of SPK-9001 overall and the steady-state levels were reached by approximately Week 12.  The majority of participants had no on-study bleeds.
