Ethical Conduct of the Study This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines. In addition, all local regulatory requirements were followed, in particular, those affording greater protection to the safety of trial participants. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the enzalutamide, a novel potent anti-androgen without known agonist activity, and the primary endpoint was overall survival. An independent, external data management committee (DMC) was formed prior to initiation of the study and monitored safety data on an ongoing basis, as well as efficacy results at the time of protocol-specified interim analysis. This interim analysis was prepared by an independent statistical unit of Novella and presented by the independent statistician to the independent DMC during a closed session on 02 Nov 2011. The DMC considered the safety profile of enzalutamide along with the overall survival results and recommended that the overall survival risk-to-benefit ratio favored the enzalutamide arm of the study (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.631, 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 0.529, 0.752, p <0.0001; estimated median survival: 18.4 vs 13.6 months for enzalutamide vs placebo, respectively). The DMC further recommended that the study be halted and that patients in the control group be crossed over to enzalutamide. Thus, the date of the 520th death ( ) was used as the analysis data cutoff date for the analyses presented in the primary clinical study report (CSR) finalized on 24 Apr 2012 (database lock was 16 Dec 2011). The primary CSR presented the results of the primary efficacy assessment (overall survival) and the key secondary assessments of changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression and bone and soft-tissue disease (radiographic progression-free survival and time to first skeletal-related event). The primary CSR also presented the results of other secondary efficacy assessments (quality of life - Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Prostate [FACT-P] questionnaire, PSA response rate, and pain palliation) and exploratory efficacy assessments (radiographic response, European Quality of Life Five-Domain [EQ-5D] questionnaire, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] Performance Status, pain progression rate, and time to pain progression [based on FACT-P]). In addition:  Pharmacokinetic (PK) results were reported in a separate bioanalytical (BA) report enzalutamide, metabolites and reported enzalutamide concentrations in patient PK samples.  A thorough QT/corrected QT (QTc) study of enzalutamide was also conducted as a substudy and was summarized in Section 12.5.1 of the primary CSR. The full report of this study, including a detailed description of analyses and results was also provided in Appendix 16.2.8.7 of the primary CSR.  An addendum to the primary CSR was finalized on 27 Sep 2016 and presented the results of the secondary endpoint analysis of the circulating tumor cell (CTC) count conversion rate and a summary of the EQ-5D questionnaire. The contents of this report are intended to supplement to the primary CSR and present the results of the final assessment of safety performed for patients enrolled in the open-label extension (OLE) phase of the study after the control group crossed over to enzalutamide. STUDY OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were previously met and summarized in the primary CSR (24 Apr 2012), BA report (13 Feb 2012), and CSR addendum (27 Sep 2016) for Protocol CRPC2 (C3431010). Data pertaining to survival and safety were collected during the OLE phase of the study and are presented in this report. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN Study Design This was a multinational Phase 3, randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled study conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety of oral enzalutamide (160 mg/day) in patients with progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer who have been previously treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy. The study was halted after enrollment and 2:1 randomization of 1199 patients (enzalutamide: 800 patients; placebo: 399 patients; primary CSR Section 10) when a protocol-specified interim analysis showed that the overall survival risk-to-benefit ratio favored enzalutamide. The interim survival analysis of 520 events demonstrated a survival benefit in favor of enzalutamide (HR: 0.631; 95% CI: 0.529, 0.752; p <0.0001, estimated median survival 18.4 vs 13.6 months for enzalutamide vs placebo, respectively). As recommended by the independent DMC after the interim analysis, the study was unblinded and patients who were randomized to placebo were offered the opportunity to be screened for the OLE phase of the study and to receive enzalutamide. Additionally, patients who were receiving enzalutamide at the time of unblinding were gradually transitioned to the OLE phase of the study and continued to receive enzalutamide. The purpose of the OLE phase of the AFFIRM study was to provide access to enzalutamide for the patients enrolled in the DB phase of the study who were either actively taking enzalutamide at the time of unblinding or were originally randomized to the placebo arm. study. The OLE collected data pertaining only to survival and safety. The long-term follow-up overall survival assessment was to be performed every 12 weeks for up to 5 years after randomization into the study. All patients randomized into the AFFIRM study who were alive were to undergo this long-term follow-up overall survival assessment whether or not they were participating in the OLE phase. Selection of Study Population in OLE Patients originally assigned to placebo and those actively taking enzalutamide were invited to return to the clinic to determine their eligibility to participate in the OLE of the AFFIRM study. Eligible patients must have had their Day 1 visit within 6 months of the site’s approval of Amendment 4 of the protocol (Version 5.0; 05 Jan 2012; Appendix 16.1.1 of the Primary CSR). Six (6) months after the amendment had been approved at a site, enrollment into the OLE was to be stopped at that site. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria DB Phase Eligibility Criteria Adult patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell features; ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or orchiectomy (ie, surgical or medical castration) and patients who have not had an orchiectomy were included in this study. Patients with serum testosterone level <1.7 nmol/L (50 ng/dL) at the Screening Visit and have had received bisphosphonate therapy for at least 4 weeks; had progressive disease by PSA or imaging after docetaxel-based chemotherapy in the setting of medical or surgical castration were included. Patients with no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens with at least 1 regimen containing docetaxel; ECOG performance status of 0–2 with estimated life expectancy of ≥6 months were included in this study. Patients with severe, concurrent disease, infection, or co-morbidity, in the judgment of the investigator and patients with metastases in the brain or active epidural disease were not included in this study. OLE Eligibility Criteria Patients who were to crossover from placebo were to be willing and able to give informed consent. These patients were also to have been undergoing an ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with a GnRH analogue or orchiectomy (ie, surgical or medical castration). If patients had not had an orchiectomy, they were required to have a plan to maintain effective GnRH-analogue therapy for the duration of the trial. Patients crossing over from placebo were also not to have had more than a total of 2 prior chemotherapy regimens or any hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or biologic therapy for prostate cancer (other than bone targeted agents or GnRH-analogue therapy) or any investigational agents within 4 weeks of Day 1. These patients had to have an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2. Severe concurrent disease, infection, or co-morbidity, that in the judgment of the investigator would make the Section 9.5.1 (primary CSR Appendix 16.1.1) for complete OLE eligibility criteria for patients randomized to placebo. Patients randomized to enzalutamide in the DB phase and continuing enzalutamide in the OLE must have been willing and able to give informed consent for OLE phase (protocol Section 9.5.2 [primary CSR Appendix 16.1.1]). Treatments In the OLE phase, patients were to receive enzalutamide, 160 mg/day, administered orally, as 4 × 40 mg capsules. Enzalutamide lot numbers used in the OLE phase are presented in Section 16.1.6. Table 1 summarizes all lots of enzalutamide and placebo used in this study. Table 1.

Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Safety and/or Other Evaluations Survival Assessment The long-term follow-up overall survival assessment was to be performed every 12 weeks for up to 5 years after randomization into the study. All living patients who had been randomized into the AFFIRM study and had not otherwise withdrawn consent were to undergo this long-term follow-up overall survival assessment whether or not they participated in the OLE. Both overall survival and use of subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy was to be reported in the long-term follow-up phase. Safety Evaluations Safety was assessed every 12 weeks through evaluation of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and clinical laboratory test data during the OLE phase. The analysis data cutoff date was 20 Feb 2018. Safety data were summarized for the safety population which included all patients who received at least 1 dose of enzalutamide. Safety Assessment Safety assessed through summaries of AEs, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and the frequency of discontinuation of enzalutamide treatment due to AEs, laboratory evaluations, and electrocardiograms. For all safety analyses descriptive statistics were used rather than inferential statistics. All AEs were coded to preferred term (PT), higher level term, and system organ class (SOC) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 16.1. The incidence of AEs was presented by MedDRA SOC and PT, relationship to study drug treatment, and severity. A patient reporting the same AE more than once is counted once, and at the maximum severity or strongest relationship to study drug treatment, when calculating incidence. Baseline and concomitant medications were coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary with preferred name and therapeutic use. In summaries of baseline and concomitant medication use, each patient was counted once per class and once per preferred name. Concomitant medications included all medications that were used on or after the date of initial study drug administration. Concomitant medications were summarized for the safety analysis set. Laboratory values were classified by the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.03) severity grade. Laboratory shift tables of the baseline results to each of the subsequent visits were produced. Changes From Planned Analyses: Safety data from the OLE were combined with the safety data from the DB phase and were assessed in the overall safety population, rather than the open-label safety population alone. Safety data was compiled for patients from the enzalutamide group followed under the DB and OLE phases and was presented by phase (DB and OLE) for patients in the placebo group. Long-term follow-up for overall survival was discontinued for all patients not on active treatment with a data cut off of 22 Mar 2013 (memo to sites on file 07 Mar 2013). RESULTS Patient Disposition and Data Sets Analyzed A summary of patients at the end of the DB and OLE phases is presented in Table 2. A total of 1199 patients were enrolled in the DB phase of this study (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 800 patients; placebo [DB]/enzalutamide [OLE]: 399 patients). A total of 109 patients randomized to enzalutamide and 50 patients randomized to placebo in the DB phase moved to the OLE. As of the data cutoff date 20 Feb 2018, no patients remained on treatment in the OLE. 14 patients; placebo [DB]/ enzalutamide [OLE]: 21 patients), moved to long-term follow-up (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 20 patients; placebo [DB]/ enzalutamide [OLE]:9 patients), or had been lost-to follow-up, had withdrawn from the study, or had experienced disease progression (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 75 patients; placebo [DB]/enzalutamide [OLE]: 20 patients).

Abbreviations: DB = double-blind; N = number of patients; OLE = open-label extension. a “Other” refers to patients who did not die, move to long-term follow-up, and/or move to OLE. b “Other” refers to patients who did not die and/or move to long-term follow-up. The use of concomitant medication during the study was collected and presented for all patients in the safety population in Table 14.1.3. The majority of patients reported at least 1 concomitant medication (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 100%; placebo [DB]: 100%; enzalutamide [OLE only]:94.0%). Protocol Deviations A listing of all protocol deviations is presented in Appendix 16.2.2. Extent of Exposure and Study Drug Compliance Extent of exposure and study drug compliance was analyzed for the safety population from data reported in the electronic case report forms (CRFs) that captured numbers of pills dispensed and returned by the patients. These data were not captured by a medication diary and therefore may reflect inaccuracies in actual patient compliance due to expected numbers of pills not being returned. This may have resulted in over estimation of compliance. Refer to Table 14.1.1. The overall compliance rate was similar between the treatment groups, and majority of the patients had a compliance rate ≥80.0%. duration of 8.3 months and had taken a median of 1021.5 capsules. Their mean (standard deviation [SD]) overall compliance rate was 108.4% (156.61). Patients taking placebo had a median treatment duration of 3.0 months in the DB and a median treatment duration of 7.7 months once they had crossed over to enzalutamide in the OLE phase. These patients had taken a median of 380 capsules in the DB phase and 904.5 capsules in the OLE phase. Their mean (SD) overall compliance rate was 106.6% (40.82) in the DB and 110.5% (40.01) in the OLE phase. Due to the initial 2:1 randomization scheme, a larger proportion of subjects took enzalutamide in the DB and OLE (800 patients) compared to the total taking placebo in the DB (399 patients) and those that crossed over to enzalutamide in the OLE (50 patients). In addition, patients remained on enzalutamide longer than placebo and the overall duration of exposure to enzalutamide was greater in the 800 patients taking enzalutamide in the DB compared to those taking placebo. Dose Modification The dose modifications are presented in Table 14.1.2. The majority of patients had no dose modifications, interruptions, or reductions (80.0% each). The primary cause of dose interruptions and dose reductions was AEs for all treatment groups. Safety Results Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events The overall summary of TEAEs is presented in Table 3. The majority of patients reported at least 1 TEAE (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 98.6% [789 patients]; placebo/enzalutamide [DB/OLE]:97.7%/96.0% [390/48 patients]). Just over half of all patients in each treatment group reported TEAEs that were Grade 3 or higher (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 52.9% [423 patients]; placebo/enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 53.6%/56.0% [214/28 patients]). There were no apparent clinically relevant differences in the proportions of patients experiencing TEAEs leading to death (Grade 5), serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation or reduction between treatment groups.

Overall, the incidence of study-drug related TEAEs were higher in patients randomized to enzalutamide (OLE/DB) (70.5%) and in patients randomized to placebo (DB) (66.7%) compared to placebo patients who crossed over to enzalutamide (OLE) (52.0%). However, the incidences of TEAEs that were Grade 3 or higher and related to study drug were similar between the treatment groups (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 12.3%; placebo [DB]: 12.0%; enzalutamide [OLE only]: 10.0%). TEAEs are summarized by SOC, PT, and strongest relationship to study drug in Table 14.3.1.3. Deaths A summary of all deaths in the safety database (taken from the death information CRF page) is presented in Table 14.3.2.1.1 and a by-patient listing of all deaths is presented in Table 14.3.2.1.2. Overall, 72.3% of the enzalutamide (DB/OLE) group, 80.5% of the placebo (DB) group, and 42.0% of the enzalutamide (OLE only) group had died on or prior to the 20 Feb 2018 cut off for this report. Over half of the deaths reported for the enzalutamide (DB/OLE) group (38.5%) and placebo (DB) group (53.1%) were reported prior to the OLE (primary CSR Table 12.3.1.1-1 cutoff date: ). The majority of all deaths in the safety database were due to disease progression (61.4% of enzalutamide [DB/OLE] patients; 69.7% of placebo [DB] patients; 34.0% of enzalutamide [OLE only] patients). A summary of TEAEs (Grade 5) that lead to death (as indicated on the AE CRF) by SOC and PT is presented in Table 5. Overall, 4.3% of the enzalutamide group (DB/OLE), 3.8% of the placebo group (DB), and 12.0% of the enzalutamide (OLE only) had at least 1 TEAE (Grade 5) that led to death. Table 5.

Serious TEAEs A summary of serious TEAEs by SOC and PT is presented in Table 6. Serious TEAEs were reported by 39.9% of the enzalutamide (DB/OLE) group, 38.8% of the placebo (DB) group, and 50.0% of the enzalutamide (OLE only) group. There were no clinically relevant differences between treatment groups. The majority of these serious TEAEs were Grade 3 or higher (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 34.9%; placebo [DB]: 33.8%; enzalutamide [OLE]: 40.0%; Table 14.3.2.3) and were not related to study drug (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 38.0%; placebo [DB]: 36.1%; enzalutamide [OLE]: 50.0%; Table 14.3.2.5).

Other Significant TEAEs TEAEs where the action recorded on the AE CRF was to discontinue study drug are summarized by SOC and PT in Table 14.3.1.11. Overall, 18.5% of the enzalutamide (DB/OLE) group, 18.5% of the placebo (DB) group, and 24.0% of the enzalutamide (OLE only) group reported TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug, and 12.8% of the enzalutamide (DB/OLE) group, 14.3% of the placebo (DB) group, and 18.0% of the enzalutamide (OLE only) group reported TEAEs that were Grade 3 or higher and led to discontinuation of study drug. These TEAEs are summarized by strongest relationship to study drug in Table 14.3.1.13. Overall, related TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported by 5.0% of the enzalutamide (DB/OLE) group, 5.5% of the placebo (DB) group, and 4.0% of the enzalutamide (OLE only) group. TEAEs where the action recorded on the AE CRF was to discontinue study drug reported by at least 2 patients in any treatment group, are presented in Table 7. summarized by SOC and PT in Table 14.3.1.14. The proportions of patients with dose reductions due to TEAEs was low in all treatment groups (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 2.3%; placebo [DB]: 2.8%; enzalutamide [OLE]: 4.0%) and few were Grade 3 or higher (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 0.9%; placebo [DB]: 1.5%; enzalutamide [OLE]:0.0%). TEAEs where the action recorded on the AE CRF was to interrupt the dose of study drug are summarized by SOC and PT in Table 14.3.1.16 and by maximum severity in Table 14.3.1.17. The proportions of patients experiencing these TEAEs were similar across treatment groups for all TEAEs (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 14.4%; placebo [DB]: 15.8%; enzalutamide [OLE]: 18.0%) and those Grade 3 or above (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 9.9%; placebo [DB]: 9.0%; enzalutamide [OLE]:12.0%).

These TEAEs are summarized by maximum severity in Table 14.3.1.9 and by strongest relationship to study drug in Table 14.3.1.10. Overall, incidences of patients discontinuing study drug due to Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were low (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 5.5%; placebo [DB]: 7.5%; enzalutamide [OLE]: 6.0%; Table 14.3.1.8), and related TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported by 3.4% of the enzalutamide (DB/OLE) group, 4.8% of the placebo (DB) group, and 4.0% of the enzalutamide (OLE only) group (Table 14.3.1.10). Other Safety Data Hematological Parameters Grade 3 or 4 hematology laboratory toxicities (post-baseline) are summarized in Table 14.3.4.2.

Hematology laboratory toxicities (post-baseline) representing an increase of at least 2 NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.03) grades from the baseline assessment are presented in Table 14.3.4.3. These occurred in <10% of each treatment group with the exception of low lymphocytes (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 20.1%; placebo [DB]: 19.0%; enzalutamide [OLE]: 14.0%). Hematology laboratory toxicities with a post-baseline shift to Grade 4 from any grade lower than 4 at baseline are presented in Table 14.3.4.4. These occurred infrequently (1% of any treatment group for each hematology laboratory parameter). Serum Chemistry Grade 3 or 4 serum chemistry laboratory toxicities (post-baseline) are summarized in Table 14.3.4.8. All Grade 3 or 4 serum chemistry laboratory toxicities occurred in <10% of each treatment group with the exception of high alkaline phosphatase (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]:12.8%; placebo [DB]: 18.5%; enzalutamide [OLE]:6.0%). Serum chemistry laboratory toxicities (post-baseline) representing an increase of at least 2 NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.03) grades from the baseline assessment are presented in Table 14.3.4.9. These occurred in <10% of each treatment group with the exception of low phosphate (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 10.3%; placebo [DB]: 7.0%; enzalutamide [OLE]: 8.0%) and low albumin (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 11.9%; placebo [DB]: 13.5%; enzalutamide [OLE]:12.0%). Serum chemistry laboratory toxicities with a post-baseline shift to Grade 4 from any grade lower than 4 at baseline are presented in Table 14.3.4.10. These occurred in <1% of each treatment group with the exception of high alkaline phosphatase (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 0.8%; placebo [DB]: 2.0%; enzalutamide [OLE]: 0.0%) and low calcium (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 0.1%; placebo [DB]: 1.3%; enzalutamide [OLE]:0.0%). Potentially clinically significant changes in vital signs are presented in Table 14.3.5.1. Overall, potentially clinically significant changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic; enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 6.5%; placebo [DB]: 4.0%; enzalutamide [OLE]: 4.0%) and heart rate (enzalutamide [DB/OLE]: 3.1%; placebo [DB]: 1.5%; enzalutamide [OLE]: 0.0%) were infrequent.
