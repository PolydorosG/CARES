Study Objectives and Endpoints Note: Refer to the B1971035 primary analysis clinical study report (CSR) dated 19 February 2018 for the primary analysis which included immunogenicity data through 1 month after Vaccination 3 and safety data through 6 months after Vaccination 3. This final CSR presents the secondary endpoints (immunopersistence data up to 2 years after Vaccination 3, immunogenicity data 1 month after booster vaccination, and safety data through 6 months after booster vaccination). a Primary safety endpoints for the final CSR included research-related injuries (RRIs)/AEs within 48 hours after blood draw. b If Visit 11 (24 months after Vaccination 3) was, the pre booster blood draw at Visit 12 was used to describe persistence of the immune response 2 years after Vaccination 3. METHODS Study Design: Stage 1 was designed and conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of bivalent recombinant lipoprotein 2086 vaccine (bivalent rLP2086) at 2 dose levels (60 g and 120 g) and hepatitis A virus (HAV)/saline in healthy toddlers aged 12 to <24 months through 12 months after Vaccination 3 of the primary series. Stage 2 was designed to evaluate the duration of the immune response up to approximately 2 years after the third dose of bivalent rLP2086; hence, only those participants randomly assigned to bivalent rLP2086 (irrespective of dose level) were eligible for Stage 2. Stage 1 includes Visit 1 (Vaccination 1) to Visit 10 (End of Stage 1 telephone contact). Stage 2 includes Visit 11 (24 months after Vaccination 3) to Visit 14 (6 months after booster vaccination). Participants who received HAV vaccine / saline during Stage 1 were not eligible for Stage 2. The participant’s parent(s)/legal guardian was notified of the participant’s eligibility to participate in Stage 2 at the Visit 10 telephone contact (occurring after Visit 9 [12 months after Vaccination 3]). Stage 2 also described the safety and immunogenicity of a single booster dose of 120 g of bivalent rLP2086 given approximately 2 years after Vaccination 3 of the primary series. Only participants who received 3 doses of bivalent rLP2086 in Stage 1 at the 120-g dose level were eligible to receive the booster vaccination. Immunopersistence evaluations after vaccination with the primary vaccination series given in Stage 1 (Vaccination 1, 2, and 3) and booster immunogenicity evaluations after booster vaccination in Stage 2 are both included in the final clinical study report (CSR). Immunopersistence evaluations included the immune response 6, 12, and 24 months after Vaccination 3. Safety events (research related injuries [RRIs] related to blood draws for serum bactericidal assay using human complement [hSBA]) were collected 6, 12, and 24 months after Vaccination 3. The study protocol initially planned to evaluate immunopersistence at 36 and 48 months after Vaccination 3, however the protocol was amended (19 September 2018) to remove these Stage 2 time points in order to add a booster vaccination requested by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Booster evaluations included the immune response 1 month after booster vaccination. Safety events were collected from the booster safety population up through 6 months after booster vaccination. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Key inclusion criteria were as follows:  Participant received all vaccinations in the relevant national immunization program (NIP) for his or her age group.  12 to <15 months or 18 to <24 months during sentinel-cohort enrollment  12 to <24 months during expanded-cohort enrollment Key exclusion criteria were as follow:  Previous vaccination with any meningococcal serogroup B vaccine.  Previous vaccination with HAV vaccine, or requirement to receive nonstudy HAV vaccine during Stage 1 of the study.  A known or suspected disorder of the immune system that would have prevented an immune response to the vaccine, such as participants with congenital or acquired defects in B-cell function or those receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Participants with terminal complement deficiency could be included. Additional details were provided in the study reference manual (SRM).  Any neuroinflammatory or autoimmune condition, including but not limited to transverse myelitis, uveitis, optic neuritis, and multiple sclerosis. Vaccines Administered: During Stage 2, a single booster dose (120 µg) of bivalent rLP2086 was administered as an intramuscular injection into either the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh muscle at Visit 12 (approximately 2 years after Vaccination 3) to only participants who received 3 doses of 120 µg of bivalent rLP2086 in Stage 1. Immunogenicity Evaluations: For the immunopersistence assessment (Stages 1 and 2), immune response was determined for participants who received either 60 or 120 µg of bivalent rLP2086 during Stage 1. Approximately 5 mL of blood was collected at approximately 1 and 2 years after Vaccination 3. If Visit 11 (24 months after Vaccination 3) was omitted, the prebooster blood draw at Visit 12 (approximately 2 years after Vaccination 3) was used to evaluate immunopersistence 2 years after Vaccination 3. To describe the booster vaccination immune response in 120-µg dose level primary series vaccine recipients, approximately 10 mL of blood was collected immediately before the 120 µg booster vaccination (Visit 12 [approximately 2 years after Vaccination 3]) and 1 month after the booster vaccination in Stage 2 (Visit 13). Safety Evaluations: At Visits 8, 9, and 11 (6, 12, and 24 months after Vaccination 3, respectively), the site inquired about any adverse reactions (AEs), as well as RRIs, for events occurring during the 48-hour period after each blood draw. If these events occurred, they were recorded in the clinical research form (CRF) and the event was followed. At the time of booster vaccination the participant’s parent(s)/legal guardian was issued an electronic diary (e-diary), based on a personal digital assistant (PDA) or equivalent use and type of antipyretic medication on the day of vaccination and for 7 days following the booster vaccination. Safety endpoints for the booster vaccination analysis included immediate AEs occurring within the first 30 minutes after investigational product (IP) administration, local reactions, systemic events, and use of antipyretic medications within 7 days after booster vaccination, AEs up to 1 month after booster vaccination, and serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended events (MAEs), and newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs) to 6 months after booster vaccination. Statistical Methods: The geometric mean titers (GMTs) and proportions of participants with hSBA titers lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, and 1:128 at each blood sampling time point through Month 24 after Vaccination 3; and before the booster vaccination (Visit 12) and 1 month following booster vaccination (Visit 13) were summarized for each of the 4 primary strains, along with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The empirical reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) were presented graphically for each of the 4 primary strains, each group, and each sampling time point through Month 24 after Vaccination 3; and for both Visit 12 (before booster vaccination) and Visit 13 (1 month after the booster dose). At Visits 8, 9, and 11 (6, 12, and 24 months after Vaccination 3, respectively) RRIs/AEs that occurred within 48 hours after the blood draw were collected and listed. After the booster vaccination safety data was summarized by combined age strata only. The proportion of participants reporting local reactions, systemic events, and use of antipyretics within 7 days of the booster vaccination were descriptively summarized by group. Two-sided 95% CIs based on the Clopper-Pearson method were presented with the proportions. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A summary of the disposition of all randomized participants is presented in Table S2. Of the participants randomized in Stage 1, greater than 90% of each vaccination group completed Stage 1 (42 [95.5%], 205 [93.2%], and 125 [94.7%] participants in the 60 µg rLP2086, 120 µg rLP2086, and HAV/saline vaccine group, respectively). Of the participants randomized at entry into Stage 2 (40 [90.9%], and 174 [79.1%] participants in the 60 µg rLP2086 and 120 µg rLP2086 vaccine group respectively), almost all the participants completed study Visit 11 (24 months after Vaccination 3). Four (9.1%), 63 (28.6%), and 2 (1.5%) participants in the 60 µg rLP2086, 120 µg rLP2086 and HAV/Saline vaccine groups respectively were withdrawn after Visit 8 (6 months after Vaccination 3) but before the booster vaccination. No participants were withdrawn due to AEs after Visit 8 (6 months after Vaccination 3) through the end of study. Of the 148 participants who entered booster stage, 147 participants received the booster dose and completed Stage 2. For the persistence safety population, in the 60 µg rLP2086 vaccine group, 52.5% were female, the majority of participants were white (85%) and non-Hispanic/non-Latino (100%), in the 120 µg rLP2086 vaccine group, 51.8% were female, and the majority of participants were white (95.3%) and non-Hispanic/non-Latino (98.8%). The mean age (standard deviation [SD]) at first vaccination was 16.6 (4.17) months in the 60 µg rLP2086 vaccine group and 17.6 (3.60) months in the 120 µg rLP2086 vaccine group. For the booster safety population (120 µg rLP2086 vaccine group), 51.0% were female, the majority of participants were white (94.6%) and non-Hispanic/non-Latino (99.3%). The mean age (SD) at booster vaccination was 54.9 (6.23) months.

Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 07JUL2020. Runtime ID: 28JUL2020 17:49. File ID: 1_1_CS_DISP_SUBJ_STG2.HTM. Immunogenicity Results: In the persistence analysis, for each of the 4 primary Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MnB) strains, the proportion of participants with hSBA titer ≥ LLOQ decreased from 6 to 24 months after Vaccination 3. Similar results were observed for the hSBA GMTs and defined hSBA titers in the persistence analysis. In the booster analysis, for each of the 4 primary MnB strains, the proportion of participants with hSBA titer ≥ LLOQ increased 1 month after booster vaccination and was similar or higher than the proportion of participants with hSBA titer ≥ LLOQ 1 month after Vaccination 3. hSBA GMTs were higher following a booster dose compared to 1 month after Vaccination 3. Safety Results:  There were a total of 7 AEs reported by 7 participants in the persistence safety analysis, none which were assessed as related to IP by the investigator. One participant who received 120 μg rLP2086 reported 1 AE of scarlet fever within 48 hours after the blood draw at Visit 11 (24 months after Vaccination 3). One participant reported a mild continuing AE of malabsorption (NDCMC) after Visit 8 (6 months after Vaccination 3) and prior to booster vaccination.  Local reactions were reported by 77.6% participants after the booster dose. Most local reactions were mild to moderate in severity. Overall, pain at injection site (70.1%) was the most commonly reported local reaction after booster vaccination. No local reaction lead to withdrawal. The percentage of local reactions reported after the booster dose (pain at injection site, redness, and swelling) were similar to the percentage of local reactions reported after the primary vaccination series (tenderness at injection site, redness, and swelling), respectively.  Systemic events were reported by 52.4% participants after booster dose. Most systemic events were mild to moderate in severity. Overall, fatigue (46.3%) was the most commonly reported systemic event after booster vaccination. No systemic events lead to after the booster dose were similar to percentage reporting fever and drowsiness in the after the primary vaccination series. Systemic events collected following booster vaccination differed from those collected following the primary vaccination series (Vaccination 1 through 3) in order to be age appropriate.  From booster vaccination up through 1 month after booster vaccination 20 (13.6%) participants reported 26 AEs. AEs were most commonly reported in the system organ class (SOC) of infections and infestations in 18 participants (12.2%). A total of 3 participants (2.0%) reported 6 AEs related to the IP as determined by the investigator. From the booster vaccination up through 6 months after booster vaccination a total of 11 (7.5%) participants reported at least 1 MAE.  Two (1.4%) participants reported a total of 2 SAEs from booster vaccination up through 6 months after booster vaccination, neither of these SAEs were related to the IP as assessed by the investigator.  No participants withdrew due to an AE or died during the period covered in this report (after Visit 8 [6 months after Vaccination 3] to 6 months after booster vaccination) Conclusion(s): When a 120-µg booster dose of bivalent rLP2086 is administered to children approximately 3 to 5 years of age 2 years after completing 3 dose 0-, 2-, 6-month schedule bivalent rLP2086 primary vaccination series, a robust anamnestic response occurs, boosting GMTs above those observed after the primary series with a similar or higher proportion achieving hSBA titers ≥ LLOQ and providing some degree of extended protection against MnB invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). Although proportions of vaccine recipients maintaining hSBA titers ≥ LLOQ decline at 6, 12 and 24 months following primary vaccination, the clinical relevance remains unknown. The booster vaccine, as administered in this study, was safe and well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in this cohort.
