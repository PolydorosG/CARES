Primary and Se condary Study Obje ctive s and Endpoints METHODS Study De sign: A total of approximately 440 adults 60 through 64 years of age with no history of pneumococcal vaccination were planned to be enrolled and randomized equally to receive an initial vaccination with either: • a single dose of 20vPnC (Vaccination 1) followed 1 month later by saline placebo (Vaccination 2) administration in the 20vPnC/saline group, or • a single dose of 13vPnC (Vaccination 1) followed 1 month later by a dose of PPSV23 (Vaccination 2) in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group (control group). Blood samples were collected on the days of investigationa l product administration prior to each study vaccination (Vaccination 1 and Vaccination 2), 1 month after Vaccination 2, and 12 months after Vaccination 1 for immunogenic ity assessments. Prompted local reactions at the injection site and prompted systemic events were collected daily for 10 and 7 days, respectively, after Vaccination 1. Adverse events (AEs) reported from the time of signing informed consent through 1 month after Vaccination 2 were collected, and serious AEs (SAEs) and newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs) were collected from the time of signing informed consent through the final visit. On Day 1 (Visit 1), participants had blood drawn for immunogenic ity assessments, received 20vPnC or 13vPnC, were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and received safety follow-up and electronic diary (e-diary) instructions. Local reactions (pain, redness, and swelling) at the injection site were prompted for and collected daily in an e-diary from Day 1 through Day 10 after the Visit 1 vaccination. Systemic events (fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain) and use of antipyretic medications were prompted for and collected daily in an e-diary from Day 1 through Day 7 after the Visit 1 vaccination. AEs (including nonserious AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs) were assessed for approximately 1 month after the Visit 1 vaccination (through Visit 2). At Visit 2 (28-35 days after Visit 1), participants returned for follow-up. Information was collected from the participants on AEs and e-diary follow-up (as needed), blood was drawn for immunogenic ity assessments (this represented the 1-month post–Vaccination 1 time point), a dose of saline was administered to participants who received 20vPnC at Visit 1, and PPSV23 was administered to participants who received 13vPnC at Visit 1. The participants were observed for 30 minutes and received safety follow-up instructions. The investigationa l product was prepared at this visit by a designated unblinded site staff member. AEs (including nonserious AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs) were assessed for approximately 1 month after the Visit 2 vaccination (through Visit 3). At Visit 3 (28-35 days after Visit 2), participants returned for safety follow-up and a blood draw for immunogenic ity assessments. At Visit 4 (approximately 6 months after the first vaccination), the sites contacted the participant via telephone to inquire about SAEs and NDCMCs. At Visit 5 (12 months [350 to 378 days] after the first vaccination), participants returned and had blood drawn for immunogenicity assessments. SAEs and NDCMCs were also collected at this visit. Inclusion/Exclusion Crite ria: Key inclusion/exc lusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion Crite ria: 1. Male or female adults ≥60 to ≤64 years of age (from the 60th birthday up to, but not including, the 65th birthday) at enrollment. 2. Healthy adults, including adults with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or requiring hospitalization within 3 months before receipt of investigationa l product, as determined by medical history, physical examination, laboratory screening, and clinical judgment of the investigator. Exclusion Crite ria: 1. Serious chronic disorder including metastatic malignancy, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen, end-stage renal disease with or without dialysis, clinically unstable cardiac disease, or any other disorder that, in the investigator’s opinion, excluded the participant from participating in the study. 2. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may have increased the risk associated with study participation or investigationa l product administration or may have interfered with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would have made the participant inappropriate for entry into this study. 3. Previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational pneumococcal vaccine, or 4. History of microbiologica lly proven invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae. 5. Participants who received treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic agents or systemic corticosteroids, or planned receipt through the last postvaccination blood draw. If systemic corticosteroids had been administered short term (<14 days) for treatment of an acute illness, participants should not have been enrolled into the study until corticosteroid therapy had been discontinued for at least 28 days before investigational product administration. Inhaled/nebulized, intra-articular, intrabursal, or topical (skin or eyes) corticosteroids were permitted. 6. Participants with known or suspected immunodefic iency or other conditions associated with immunosuppression, including, but not limited to, immunoglobulin class/subclass deficiencies, generalized malignancy, human immunodefic ienc y virus infection, leukemia, lymphoma, or organ or bone marrow transplant. Vaccine s Administe re d: All participants received a single dose (0.5 mL) of investigational product administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle, preferably in the nondominant arm, at Visit 1 and Visit 2. Immunoge nicity Evaluations: Blood samples (approximately 30 or 50 mL/visit) for immunogenic ity assessments were collected from all participants prior to Vaccination 1, prior to Vaccination 2 (post-Vaccination 1/pre–Vaccination 2), approximately 1 month (28 to 35 days) after Vaccination 2, and approximately 1 year after Vaccination 1. Safe ty Evaluations: Safety evaluations included acute reactions within the first 30 minutes after investigationa l product administration and prompted e-diary events: local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) within 10 days after Vaccination 1 and systemic events (fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain) within 7 days after Vaccination 1. Participants were also asked to measure oral temperature at home for any suspected fever and use of antipyretic and/or pain medication for 7 days after Vaccination 1. In addition, AEs, SAEs, and NDCMCs were collected. Statistical Me thods: No formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed. A descriptive estimation approach was used to assess the safety and immunogenic ity objectives in the study. Immunoge nicity Analysis: Opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) titers for the 20 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F) were determined in each participant for each blood sample at available protocol-specified blood draw visits. OPA titers were summarized as geometric mean titers (GMTs) for each pneumococcal serotype by each vaccine group at each blood sampling time point. GMTs and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided for each pneumococcal serotype by each vaccine group at each blood sampling time point. The GMT was calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the logarithm transformation and then back transformation to its original scale. Two (2)-sided 95% CIs were constructed by back transformation of the CI for the mean of the logarithmica lly transformed assay results computed based on the Student t distribution. Geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) were calculated using the ratio of the later assay value divided by the earlier assay value. Ratios were log-transformed, then applying the same geometric mean calculations and the associated 95% CI calculations as described above. The anti-log of the calculations in ln scale formed the GMFR and its 95% CI. Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) plotted proportion of participants with value equal to or exceeding specified assay value versus indicated assay value, for all observed assay values. Safe ty Analysis: All safety summaries were provided by vaccine group using descriptive statistics. No statistical comparisons were planned for safety data. The exact 95% CIs for binary safety endpoints CIs were computed using the F distribution (Clopper-Pearson). RESULTS Participant Disposition and De mography: Disposition of participants was similar for both groups, with the most common reason for withdrawal being lost to follow-up. One participant randomized to the 20vPnC/saline group was not vaccinated because the participant did not meet eligibility criteria (Table S2). Demographic characteristics were similar in the 20vPnC/saline group and the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group. Vaccination 1 221 ( 99.5) 222 (100.0) 443 ( 99.8) Immunoge nicity Re sults: OPA GMTs At baseline (before Vaccination 1), OPA GMTs for all 20 serotypes were similar in the 20vPnC/saline and the 13vPnC/PPSV23 groups. After vaccination with 20vPnC, an immune response was observed based on increased OPA GMTs to all 20 serotypes in the 20vPnC/saline group (Table S3 and Table S4). For each of the 13vPnC serotypes, the 95% CIs for OPA GMTs 1 month after Vaccination 1 overlapped in the vaccine groups, although this was marginal for 19F (Table S3). For the 7 additional serotypes, the 95% CIs for the OPA GMTs 1 month after Vaccination 1 for the 20vPnC/saline group and 1 month after Vaccination 2 for the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group did not overlap for serotypes 10A, 15B, 22F, and 8 (Table S4). The OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination with 20vPnC from the 20vPnC/saline group were higher than the OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination with PPSV23 from the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group for serotypes 10A, 15B, and 22F, but the OPA GMT from the 20vPnC/saline group was lower than the OPA GMT from the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group for serotype 8. The OPA GMTs at each time point through 1 month after Vaccination 2 are presented in Table S5. As expected, vaccination with 13vPnC did not elicit responses to the additional 7 serotypes at 1 month after vaccination in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group. The OPA GMTs for group were similar to or slightly higher than the OPA GMTs 1 month after the initial dose of 13vPnC. This supports the use of the 13vPnC/PPSV23 vaccine regimen as an appropriate control for this study CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS 1 Month after Vaccination 1 204 455 ( 349.2, 592.2) 205 738 ( 582.1, 936.5) CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS 1 Month after Vaccination 1 207 1164 ( 949.6, 1428.0) 203 1612 ( 1311.4, 1981.4) CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS 11A Before vaccination 202 288 ( 219.2, 378.9) 183 292 ( 216.3, 393.2) CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS OPA GMFRs A 6-fold or higher OPA GMFR was observed for all 20 serotypes 1 month after vaccination with 20vPnC (Table S6 and Table S7). After vaccination with 20vPnC or 13vPnC, the 95% CIs for OPA GMFRs from before Vaccination 1 to 1 month after Vaccination 1 for the 13vPnC serotypes overlapped in the vaccine groups, although this was marginal for serotypes 1, 5, 9V, and 19F (Table S6). For the 7 additional serotypes, the 95% CIs for OPA GMFRs from before Vaccination 1 to 1 month after Vaccination 1 for the 20vPnC group and 1 month after Vaccination 2 for the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group also overlapped in the vaccine groups for serotypes 8, 11A, 12F, and 33F (Table S7). The OPA GMFRs from before Vaccination 1 to 1 month after vaccination with 20vPnC in the 20vPnC/saline group were higher than the GMFRs from before Vaccination 1 to 1 month after vaccination with PPSV23 in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group for serotypes 10A, 15B, and 22F, and the 95% CIs did not overlap for these serotypes. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS 19F 20vPnC/Saline 201 39 ( 34.0, 45.1) 201 460 ( 352.5, 599.4) 201 11.8 ( 8.93, 15.47) CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Safe ty Re sults: Local Reactions Local reactions were collected after Vaccination 1 from Day 1 through Day 10. Local reactions after Vaccination 2 that met criteria for AEs were reported as AEs. The proportions of participants who reported prompted local reactions within 10 days after vaccination with 20vPnC or 13vPnC by maximum severity were similar in the 2 groups (Table S8). The most frequent local reaction reported was pain at injection site, and most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Local reactions had a median day of onset between 1 to 2 days after Vaccination 1 and generally resolved with median durations between 1 to 2 days for both vaccine groups. Any local reactionf 220 134 ( 60.9) (54.1, 67.4) 222 126 ( 56.8) (50.0, 63.4) Systemic Events The proportions and maximum severity of prompted systemic events reported within 7 days after vaccination were similar for the 2 groups (Table S9). The most frequent systemic event reported was muscle pain, and most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Systemic events had a median day of onset between 1 to 3 days after Vaccination 1 and generally resolved with median durations between 1 to 2 days for both vaccine groups. Adverse Events At 1 month after Vaccination 1, the proportions of participants reporting any AEs were similar in the 2 groups (Table S10). From Vaccination 2 to 1 month after Vaccination 2, the proportions of participants reporting any AEs were higher in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group than in 20vPnC/saline group, particularly in system organ class (SOC) of general disorders and administration site conditions, which may be expected as one group received saline while the other received PPSV23 (Table S11). One month after participants received each vaccination, infections and infestations were the most frequently reported types of AEs by SOC in both groups (Table S10 and Table S11). The most frequently reported AEs by preferred term within 1 month after each vaccination was upper respiratory tract infection in both group, whereas injection site pain, and injection site swelling were also frequently reported in the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group 1 month after Vaccination 2 (Table S10 and Table S11).  Pneumonia 0 (0.0, 1.7) 1 ( 0.5) (0.0, 2.6)  Rash 0 (0.0, 1.7) 2 ( 0.9) (0.1, 3.3) Few participants reported AEs that were considered related to vaccination after receiving Vaccination 1 (4 participants [20vPnC/saline]; 3 participants [13vPnC/PPSV23]) and after receiving Vaccination 2 (2 participants [20vPnC/saline]; 16 participants [13vPnC/PPSV23]) in the 2 groups. The most frequent related AEs reported were in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions. Few severe AEs were reported after Vaccination 1 (3 participants each) and after Vaccination 2 (1 participant [20vPnC/saline]; 6 participants [13vPnC/PPSV23]). Deaths, Serious Adverse Events, Safety-Related Participant Withdrawals, Newly Diagnosed Chronic Medical Conditions, and Other Significant Adverse Events Deaths: No participants died during the study. Serious Adverse Events: Of the 20 participants (9 participants [20vPnC/Saline]; 11 [13vPnC/PPSV23]) who reported any SAE during the study, the majority were reported after 1 month after Vaccination 2 (9 participants [20vPnC/Saline]; 7 participants [13vPnC/PPSV23]). No SAEs reported were considered related to vaccine. One participant randomized to the 13vPnC/PPSV23 group reported an SAE of pneumoccocal meningitis, and serotyping identified the pneumococcal isolate as 7C, a non-vaccine type. Safety-Related Participant Withdrawals: Newly Diagnosed Chronic Medical Conditions: Of the 21 participants (13 participants [20vPnC/Saline]; 8 participants [13vPnC/PPSV23]) who reported any NDCMC during the study, the majority were reported after 1 month after Vaccination 2 (9 participants [20vPnC/Saline]; 3 participants [13vPnC/PPSV23]). No NDCMCs reported were considered related to vaccine. Other Significant Adverse Events: No immediate AEs were reported after any study vaccination. No participants reported other significant AEs during the study. Conclusions: The administration of 20vPnC was well tolerated, and AEs reported in the study were consistent with medical events or conditions that are common to this age group. The safety profile was similar to 13vPnC, and there were no safety signals identified in this Phase 2 study. The data also demonstrate that the 20vPnC induces functional OPA immune responses that are anticipated to be associated with protection.
