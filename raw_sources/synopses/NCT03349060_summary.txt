Table 1. Study Objectives and Endpoints Table 1. Study Objectives and Endpoints a. The frequency of pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS) was not analyzed because, after its selection as an endpoint in the study protocol, evidence was uncovered that suggested the instrument did not have sufficient content validity. Specifically, the response scale for the frequency of pruritus NRS was found not to be ideally representative of the range of frequency levels from the perspective of the target population based on qualitative research. b. A population PK model will be developed for estimating PK parameters. Additional details of the methodology and the results will be reported separately and not included in this clinical study report. METHODS Study Design: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PF-04965842 monotherapy in subjects aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe AD and a body weight 40 kg. The treatment duration was 12 weeks. Subjects were screened within 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product to confirm that they met the subject selection criteria for the study. Subjects who continued to meet eligibility criteria at baseline underwent Day 1/ baseline assessments and were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive PF-04965842 200 mg once daily (QD), PF-04965842 100 mg QD, or placebo. Randomization was stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [IGA = 3] vs. severe [IGA = 4] AD), and age <18 and ≥18 years of age. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: The study population consisted of subjects aged ≥12 years who met all the following AD criteria: • Clinical diagnosis of chronic AD for at least 1 year prior to Day 1 and had confirmed AD (Hanifin and Rajka criteria of AD) at the screening and baseline visits; • Documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of inadequate response to treatment with topical medications for at least 4 weeks, or for whom topical treatments are otherwise medically inadvisable (eg, because of important side effects or safety risks), or who have required systemic therapies for control of their disease; • Moderate to severe AD (affected BSA 10%, IGA 3, EASI 16, and pruritus numeric rating scale [NRS] 4 at the baseline visit). Study Treatment: Subjects were dispensed 2 bottles at each dispensing visit and were to take one tablet from each bottle, once daily, preferably in the morning, at approximately the same time of day for 12 weeks.

Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: The PK endpoint was population PK characterization in subjects aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Blood for PK analysis was collected at the study site prior to dosing at Week 4, at 0.5 hours (15 min) postdose at Week 4, at 0.5 hours (15 min) and 4.0 hours (30 min) postdose at Week 12. The PK data collected in adolescents were monitored periodically by the external data monitoring committee (E-DMC) to ensure acceptable benefit risk. The PK data from the first 20 adolescent subjects were analyzed to confirm the dose concentration relationship and assess consistency with adult data. Population PK analysis of adolescent subjects at the 200 mg or 100 mg QD doses were examined separately in a population modeling analysis report. Safety Evaluations: Safety was assessed by the spontaneous reporting of AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the investigational product. The safety endpoints included incidence of treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs), incidence of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation, and incidence of clinical abnormalities and change from baseline in clinical laboratory values, ECG measurements, and vital signs. Statistical Methods: PF-04965842 200 mg QD was declared superior to placebo if the null hypothesis of no difference between PF-04965842 200 mg QD versus placebo for both co-primary endpoints was rejected at the 5% significance level. Similarly, no difference between PF-04965842 100 mg QD versus placebo for both co-primary endpoints was rejected at the significance level specified below. A sequential Bonferroni-based iterative multiple testing procedure to strongly control the familywise Type 1 error at 5% was used for testing each of the two PF-04965842 doses (200 mg QD and 100 mg QD) versus placebo on the primary and key secondary endpoints. The procedure belonged to a class of consonant multiple test procedures, which are a subclass of the closed test procedures. For co-primary and secondary endpoints, binary data at each scheduled visit were analyzed. The test of hypothesis (and the p-value) between the PF-04965842 treatment groups versus the placebo group were conducted by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) statistic adjusting for the effect of randomization strata; p-values from the CMH statistic were used to establish the superiority of each dose of PF-04965842 to placebo in binary responses. The proportion of responders in the PF-04965842 treatment groups versus the placebo group were summarized by the difference and its 95% confidence interval (CI) obtained by normal approximation. The difference in proportions was calculated within each randomization stratum. The final estimate of the difference in proportions was a weighted average of these stratum-specific estimates using CMH weights. Estimates of the difference in proportions along with the two-sided 95% CI were also provided for the PF-04965842 200 mg QD group versus the PF-04965842 100 mg QD group. No hypotheses were tested. In this analysis, subjects who permanently discontinued study for any reason or required a rescue medication were defined as “non-responders” at all subsequent visits. For secondary endpoints, the proportion of responders in each treatment group along with the differences in proportion of responders among each pair of treatment groups were obtained using the methods described above. To account for the responses which were missing because the data could not be assessed at the scheduled visits of Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 in several subjects, a hybrid approach was used. First, an imputation model based on a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was fit to the observed data with treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed factors and a subject-specific normally-distributed random effect. Second, any responses which were missing due to the subject discontinuing permanently or due to a rescue medication were defined as “non-response”. Third, any other response which remained missing at any intermittent visits was multiply imputed under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. The multiple imputation methodology was used with the missing not at random (MNAR) weights taken as zero (ie, assuming MAR). The change from baseline in the PSAAD score was analyzed as longitudinal continuous data. A mixed-effect, repeated measures (MMRM) model was used. The fixed effects of treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and randomization stratification factors were included. Visit was modeled as a categorical covariate. Unstructured covariance matrix was assumed for the model errors. Compound symmetry covariance matrix was used if the model with unstructured covariance did not converge. When modeling the change from baseline values, the variable for visit started with the first postbaseline visit, and the actual baseline value was included as a covariate. At each visit, estimates of least square mean (LSM) values and the LSM differences between the PF-04965842 treated groups and the placebo group were derived from the model. The corresponding p-values, standard errors, and 95% CIs were also derived from the model. Estimates of the difference in LSMs along with the two-sided 95% CI were also provided for the PF-04965842 200 mg QD group versus the PF-04965842 100 mg QD group. No hypotheses were tested. Missing values arising postbaseline were not imputed explicitly. The MMRM yielded valid inferences in the presence of missing data mechanism which was assumed to be MAR. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 553 subjects were screened and 387 subjects were randomized. Higher proportions of subjects in the PF-04965842 treatment groups completed the 12-week study compared with the placebo group (Table 3). The proportion of subjects who discontinued was higher in the placebo group compared with either PF-04965842 treatment group; this was primarily accounted for by a higher proportion of subjects who discontinued due to AEs. The analyses of the efficacy and PRO endpoints were performed using the Full Analysis Set 1 dose of study medication. Additional supportive analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were performed for the per protocol analysis set (PPAS), which excluded 22, 24, and 20 subjects in the PF-04965842 200 mg QD, PF-04965842 100 mg QD, and placebo groups, respectively, resulting in an overall 83% of the total FAS population. The analysis of AEs and laboratory data was performed for the Safety Analysis Set, which comprised all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication and was identical to the FAS population. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced across treatment groups. The median age of subjects randomized across treatment groups was 29.0 years, with approximately 22% of subjects who were adolescents aged 12 to <18 years at the time of screening. The majority of subjects across treatment groups were white (72.1%); 15.0% of all subjects were of Asian descent and 8.3% were Black or African American. The median disease duration (range) was approximately 20 years (1, 69). Randomized subjects were representative of the moderate to severe AD population, with all subjects with moderate (59.2%) or severe (40.8%) IGA, median EASI score of 25.6, median PP-NRS of 7.0, and baseline PRO values representative of a high burden of disease and impact on QoL. Efficacy Results: Co-Primary Endpoints Both co-primary endpoints were met. Both PF-04965842 200 mg QD and 100 mg QD treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant differences in IGA and EASI-75 responses from the placebo group (Table 4 and Table 5). Although not statistically tested, the IGA and EASI-75 responses (placebo-corrected) in the PF-04965842 200 mg QD group was approximately twice that in the PF-04965842 100 mg QD group. Additional supportive sensitivity analysis results based on the PPAS and a tipping point analysis (where all missing responses were multiply imputed) were consistent with the FAS primary analysis. Estimate (%) 15.8 36.0 95% Confidence Interval (12.3, 33.7) Key Secondary Endpoints Both key secondary endpoints were met. At Weeks 2, 4, and 12, both PF-04965842 treatment groups had statistically significantly greater proportions of subjects achieving ≥4 points improvement from baseline in NRS for severity of pruritus (PP-NRS4) responders compared with the placebo group, with PP-NRS4 response beginning as early as Week 2 and plateauing by Week 4 (Table 6). At Week 12 the LSM of change from baseline in PSAAD scores showed statistically significant decreases from baseline for both PF-04965842 treatment groups compared with the placebo group (Table 7).

The secondary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant in the PF-04965842 treatment groups compared with the placebo group. • At Week 8, both PF-04965842 treatment groups had statistically significantly greater proportions of PP-NRS4 responders compared with the placebo group (Table 6). • The Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the time to first PP-NRS4 showed statistically significantly shorter median times in both PF-04965842 treatment groups compared with the placebo group (Figure S1).    that were maintained up to Week 12. Beginning at Week 2 for the PF-04965842 200 mg QD group and only at Week 8 for the PF-04965842 100 mg QD group, statistically significant differences in SCORAD75 compared with the placebo group were observed. SCORAD Sleep Loss: Based on the MMRM analysis, beginning at Week 2 both PF-04965842 treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant differences in SCORAD VAS of sleep loss compared with the placebo group that were maintained up to Week 12. Patient-Reported Outcomes DLQI/CDLQI: For DLQI (adult subjects), statistically significant differences from the placebo group for both PF-04965842 treatment groups occurred as early as Week 2 and were maintained up to Week 12. For CDLQI, adolescent subjects included 32 subjects in each PF-04965842 QD group and 16 subjects in the placebo group; in the PF-04965842 200 mg QD group, statistically significant differences from the placebo group occurred as early as Week 2, and in the PF-04965842 100 mg QD group only at Week 4. HADS: Based on the MMRM analyses, statistically significant differences from the placebo group occurred beginning at Week 2 in the PF-04965842 200 mg QD group and at no time point in the PF-04965842 group for the HADS anxiety sub-scores. The PF-04965842 200 mg QD group showed statistically significant differences from the placebo group beginning at Week 2, and the PF-04965842 100 mg QD group showed statistically significant differences compared from the placebo group beginning at Week 4 for the HADS depression sub-scores. POEM: Beginning at Week 2, statistically significant differences for both PF-04965842 treatment groups compared with the placebo group in POEM occurred and were maintained up to Week 12. PtGA: Based on the MMRM analysis, beginning at Week 2 statistically significant differences for both PF-04965842 treatment groups compared with the placebo group in PtGA occurred and were maintained up to Week 12. EQ-5D-5L/EQ-5D-Y: For EQ-5D-5L EQ-VAS and index value, statistically significant differences were observed at all time points in the PF-04965842 200 mg QD group and at Weeks 2, 8, and 12 in the PF-04965842 100 mg QD group compared with the placebo group. For EQ-5D-Y, statistically significant differences for EQ-VAS occurred at Weeks 2, 4, and 12 and for the index value at Week 4 only in the PF-04965842 200 mg QD group compared with the placebo group; in the PF-04965842 100 mg QD group, the index value at Week 4 was statistically significantly different from the placebo group. FACIT-F/ Peds-FACIT-F: Based on the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), the FACIT-F in adult subjects was statistically significantly different for both PF-04965842 treatment groups compared with the placebo group at Week 12. The Peds-FACIT-F in adolescent subjects was not statistically significantly different for both PF-04965842 treatment groups compared with the placebo group. SF-36v2: Based on the ANCOVA, statistically significant differences of physical and mental component summary scores in SF-36v2 were observed in the PF-04965842 200 mg QD group compared with the placebo group at Week 12, and in the PF-04965842 100 mg QD group, a statistically significant difference was observed for the physical component summary score only. Pharmacokinetic Results: For both PF-04965842 200 mg QD and 100 mg QD groups, maximum plasma PF-04965842 concentrations were apparent at the 30-minute post-dose PK sampling time in this study. The median plasma PF-04965842 concentrations observed prior to dosing on Day 29, at 30 minutes post-dose on Days 29 and 85 and 4 hours post-dose on Day 85 increased in a proportion similar to the 2-fold increase in the dose between the PF-04965842 200 mg QD group and PF-04965842 100 mg QD group. Safety Results: • A higher incidence of subjects with all-causality treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurred in the PF-04965842 treatment groups compared with the placebo group (Table 8). • The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate; the incidence of severe TEAEs was lower in the PF-04965842 treatment groups compared with the placebo group. • Approximately one-third of all-causality TEAEs were considered treatment-related by the investigator. • A similar proportion of subjects had serious TEAEs across all treatment groups (3.2% to 3.9%) and no deaths were reported in the study. • The incidence of subjects who permanently discontinued from the study due to TEAEs was lower in the PF-04965842 treatment groups compared with the placebo group.
