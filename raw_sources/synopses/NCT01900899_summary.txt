GENERIC DRUG NAME AND/OR COMPOUND NUMBER Meningococcal Polysaccharide Groups A, C, W–135, and Y Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine (MenACWY-TT) Marketed as Nimenrix, Compound Number: PF-06866681 PROTOCOL NO.: MenACWY-TT-102 (C0921001) PROTOCOL TITLE: Final Report: A Phase III, Open, Multicentre, Controlled Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Antibody Persistence at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 Years After a Booster Dose of Meningococcal Serogroup A, C, W–135, and Y Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine (MenACWY-TT) or Meningitec Administered in Healthy 5-Year-Old Children in Study MenACWY-TT-048 EXT: 039 Y2, 3, 4, 5 (112036), Who Were Primed With the Same Vaccine in Study MenACWY-TT-039 (109670) at 12 Through 23 Months of Age. Study Centers: This study was undertaken by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and conducted at multiple sites in Finland. Sponsorship of the study was transferred to Pfizer, Inc on 12 April 2016, after all subjects had completed Visit 3 (Year 4). Study Initiation Date and Primary Completion or Final Completion Dates: 16 July 2013 (first informed consent form [ICF] signed) to 08 November 2017 (last Visit 5 [Year 6] blood draw completed), serology completion date: 16 July 2018 (last Visit 5 [Year 6] assay completed) Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Primary Objective: Immunogenicity Persistence At 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years after booster vaccination of children with MenACWY-TT or Meningitec subjects with serum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement (rSBA) antibody titers 1:8 for each of the 4 serogroups. Secondary Objectives: Immunogenicity Persistence At 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years after booster vaccination of children with MenACWY-TT or Meningitec  To evaluate the persistence of meningococcal A, C, W–135, and Y antibodies in terms of the percentage of subjects with rSBA titers 1:128 and geometric mean titers (GMTs) and serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) titers 1:4 and 1:8 and GMTs for each of the 4 serogroups. Safety  To describe serious adverse events (SAEs) related to vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy (ie, meningococcal disease) from the subject’s last visit in Study MenACWY-TT-048 up to each yearly visit in the current study in a retrospective manner. METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 3, open-label, controlled, multicenter, single-country study with 2 parallel groups to evaluate the persistence of meningococcal antibodies up to 6 years after booster vaccination in children who participated in Study 112036 (MenACWY-TT-048). There were 2 parallel groups with the subjects in this study being allocated to the same groups and retaining the same subject numbers as the previous study:  ACWY-TT group: Subjects vaccinated and boosted with MenACWY-TT  MenCCRM group: Subjects vaccinated and boosted with Meningitec Parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) of subjects vaccinated with a booster dose of a meningococcal conjugate vaccine in Study MenACWY-TT-048 were contacted to enroll their child/ward in the current study MenACWY-TT-102 (C0921001) at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 years after the booster vaccination unless the parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) withdrew consent during Study MenACWY-TT-048 and/or sites were closed. The maximum number of subjects who could return at Visit 1 (Month 24) was 248 subjects in total: 206 in the ACWY-TT group and 42 in the MenCCRM group. 10% of the potential subjects would not participate to the persistence study at Visit 1 (Month 24). Therefore, a total of 223 subjects (185 in the ACWY-TT group and 38 in the MenCCRM group) were expected to participate at Visit 1 (Month 24). The total duration of the study for each subject was approximately 4 years.  Epoch 001: Persistence Visit 1 (Year 2 [Month 24] after booster vaccination)  Epoch 002: Persistence Visit 2 (Year 3 [Month 36] after booster vaccination)  Epoch 003: Persistence Visit 3 (Year 4 [Month 48] after booster vaccination)  Epoch 004: Persistence Visit 4 (Year 5 [Month 60] after booster vaccination)  Epoch 005: Persistence Visit 5 (Year 6 [Month 72] after booster vaccination). A subject could join at any visit in the study (for instance, a subject could have joined at Visit 2, without Visit 1 being done). The study design is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Study Design Overview Abbreviations: BS = blood sample; MMRV = measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella; Vacc = vaccination in Study MenACWY-TT-039. Note: Vaccines were administered at 12 to 23 months of age in primary study MenACWY-TT-039; booster vaccine was administered at 5 years of age in Study MenACWY-TT-048. Note: ACWY-TT Group = pooled Co-ad and ACWY-TT groups from primary study MenACWY-TT-039 who were primed and boosted with MenACWY-TT (Co-ad group = MenACWY-TT + MMRV vaccine followed by the second dose of MMRV vaccine 84 days later; ACWY-TT group = MenACWY-TT followed by 2 doses of MMRV vaccine 42 and 84 days later). Note: MenCCRM Group = pooled MMRV and MenCCRM groups from primary study MenACWY-TT-039 who were primed and boosted with Meningitec (MMRV group = MMRV vaccine followed by Meningitec 42 days later and the second dose of MMRV vaccine 84 days later; MenCCRM group = Meningitec followed by 2 doses of MMRV vaccine 42 and 84 days later). investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the intervals between visits were strictly followed. These intervals determined each subject’s evaluability in the according-to-protocol (ATP) analyses. Blood samples were to be taken at each of the study visits, ie, 2 years (Visit 1), 3 years (Visit 2), 4 years (Visit 3), 5 years (Visit 4), and 6 years (Visit 5) after booster vaccination in Study MenACWY-TT-048. Approximately 7 mL at Visits 1, 2, and 3 and approximately 10 mL at Visits 4 and 5 of whole venous blood were collected using Vacutainer tubes with serum separator. After blood centrifugation and serum separation, samples were stored at -20C or below until collection by the sponsor. Each blood sample was tested using rSBA to measure activity against Neisseria meningitidis group A (rSBA-MenA), N meningitidis group C (rSBA-MenC), N meningitidis group W–135 (rSBA-MenW–135), and N meningitidis group Y (rSBA-MenY). Bactericidal antibodies are recognized as surrogate markers of protection. For rSBA-MenC, a titer 1:8 has been shown to be the most consistent with observed efficacy at 4 weeks postvaccination with the meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine in post-licensure efficacy estimates in United Kingdom1. The threshold for protection for other serogroups is still to be defined, although it is common practice to extend the 1:8 titer cutoff to rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW–135, and rSBA-MenY.2 Each blood sample was tested using hSBA to measure activity against N meningitidis group A (hSBA-MenA), N meningitidis group C (hSBA-MenC), N meningitidis group W-135 (hSBA-MenW–135), and N meningitidis group Y (hSBA-MenY). For hSBA against N meningitidis group C (hSBA-MenC) testing, a titer 1:4 has been shown to be a correlate of protection.3 It is common practice to extend this cutoff as a correlate of protection for groups A, W-135, and Y. Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): A total of 223 subjects (185 in the ACWY-TT group and 38 in the MenCCRM group) were expected to participate at Visit 1 (Month 24). A total of 184 subjects were enrolled, of which 159 were enrolled in the ACWY-TT group (subjects previously vaccinated and boosted with MenACWY-TT) and 25 in the MenCCRM group (subjects previously vaccinated and boosted with Meningitec). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they met all of the following inclusion criteria:  Subjects’ parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) who, in the opinion of the investigator, could and would comply with the requirements of the protocol (eg, return for follow-up visits). MenACWY-TT or Meningitec in Study MenACWY-TT-039 and MenACWY-TT-048, respectively.  Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) of the subject.  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study. Subjects were ineligible to participate in this study if they met any of the following exclusion criteria:  Child in care.  History of meningococcal disease.  Administration of a meningococcal polysaccharide or a meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine outside of Study MenACWY-TT-039 and Study MenACWY-TT-048.  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).  Bleeding disorders, such as thrombocytopenia, or subjects on anti-coagulant therapy. Study Vaccine: No investigational products were administered in this persistence study. Immunogenicity Endpoints: The primary immunogenicity endpoints were:  Persistence of antibodies with respect to components of the investigational vaccine, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years after booster vaccination:  rSBA-MenA titers 1:8.  rSBA-MenC titers 1:8.  rSBA-MenW–135 titers 1:8.  rSBA-MenY titers 1:8. The secondary immunogenicity endpoints were:  Persistence of antibodies with respect to components of the investigational vaccine, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years after booster vaccination:  rSBA-MenC titers 1:128 and GMTs.  rSBA-MenW–135 titers 1:128 and GMTs.  rSBA-MenY titers 1:128 and GMTs.  hSBA-MenA titers 1:4, 1:8 and GMTs.  hSBA-MenC titers 1:4, 1:8 and GMTs.  hSBA-MenW–135 titers 1:4, 1:8 and GMTs.  hSBA-MenY titers 1:4, 1:8 and GMTs. Safety Evaluations: The investigators or site staff was/were responsible for the detection, documentation and reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an SAE. Each subject’s parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) were instructed to contact the investigator immediately should the subject manifest any signs or symptoms they perceived as serious. All SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study were collected and reported from the subject’s last visit in Study 112036 (MenACWY-TT-048). SAEs that were related to the investigational vaccine and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy were collected and reported from the subject’s last visit in Study MenACWY-TT-048 until the subject was discharged from the study. In addition to the above-mentioned reporting requirements and to fulfill international reporting obligations, SAEs that were related to study participation (ie, protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, changes from existing therapy) were collected and reported from the time of informed consent until the subject was discharged from the study. Investigators were not obligated to actively seek information about SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learned of any SAE after a subject had been discharged from the study, and he/she considered the event reasonably related to the investigational vaccine/product, the investigator was required to report the event to Pfizer. Immunogenicity Analysis Analysis Populations Several cohorts were defined for the purpose of analyses. The definitions of the cohorts are described below. Total Cohort at Month X The total cohort at Month X (where X=24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 months after booster vaccination) included all subjects who received the primary vaccination in Study MenACWY-TT-039 and booster vaccination in Study MenACWY-TT-048 and came back for a visit at Month X. The analysis of persistence at Month X included all vaccinated subjects for whom data concerning persistence endpoint measures were available at Month X. ATP Cohort for Persistence at Month X The ATP cohort for persistence at Month X (where X=24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 months after booster vaccination) included all evaluable subjects:  who received the primary and booster vaccination with MenACWY-TT or Meningitec in Study MenACWY-TT-039 and Study MenACWY-TT-048, respectively.  who had available assay results for at least 1 tested antigen at Month X.  who did not receive a meningococcal polysaccharide or a meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine not planned in Study 200088 (MenACWY-TT-102 EXT: 048 Y2, 3, 4, 5, 6) before Month X.  who did not have a history of meningococcal group A, C, W–135, and Y disease prior to Month X.  who complied with the blood sampling intervals defined in the protocol for Month X.  who did not have an immune compromising medical condition.  who did not receive any immunosuppressant(s) or other immune-modifying drug(s), immunoglobulins, any blood products, investigational drugs, and/or investigational vaccines.  who were not excluded from the booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity or the ATP cohort for persistence at Month 60 in Study MenACWY-TT-048, unless the reason for exclusion was either non-compliance with the protocol-defined serum sampling windows or a lack of availability of immunogenicity results at a previous time point. When presenting different time points, the adapted ATP cohort was used to denote that for each time point the corresponding ATP cohort for immunogenicity/persistence was used. More specifically, the analysis on the pre and postbooster time points was based on the booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity defined in Study MenACWY-TT-048. The analysis on the Month 12 time point was based on the ATP cohort for persistence at Month 60 (60 months after the first vaccination in primary study MenACWY-TT-039, 12 months after the booster vaccination in Study MenACWY-TT-048). The analysis on the Month 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 time points was based on the ATP cohort for persistence at Months 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 in Study MenACWY-TT-102, respectively. Total Enrolled Cohort The total enrolled cohort included all the subjects enrolled in the study irrespective of the visit at which they were enrolled. Note: For the analysis of persistence, presenting pre and postbooster data from Study MenACWY-TT-048 and all time points from Study MenACWY-TT-102, this included all subjects with an immunogenicity result available at a respective time point. More specifically, this included subjects with immunogenicity results available at each time point and belonging to a corresponding total vaccinated cohort at Month 60 (Study MenACWY-TT-048) or total cohort (Studies MenACWY-TT-048 and MenACWY-TT-102), regardless of their enrollment in Study MenACWY-TT-102. Analysis of Persistence Persistence data were analyzed at Month 24, Month 36, Month 48, Month 60, and Month 72 as soon as results for all individual subjects at each time point were available. The analysis of persistence was based on the adapted ATP cohort. If for any vaccine group, at any time point, the percentage of subjects with serological results excluded for the corresponding ATP cohort was higher than 5%, a second analysis based on the total enrolled cohort was performed to complement the ATP analysis. Within Group Analysis For each vaccine group, at each blood sampling time point, for each antigen assessed:  GMTs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were tabulated.  Percentages of subjects with titers above the proposed cutoffs with exact 95% CIs were calculated. Analysis Populations The total enrolled cohort was used for all safety analyses. Methods of Analysis At each persistence time point, all reported SAEs related to vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy from the subject’s last visit in Study MenACWY-TT-048 were described in detail in a retrospective manner. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A summary of the disposition of subjects in the total enrolled cohort through Month 72 after booster vaccination is presented in Table 1. Of the 184 enrolled subjects, 159 were enrolled in the ACWY-TT group (subjects previously vaccinated and boosted with MenACWY-TT) and 25 in the MenCCRM group (subjects previously vaccinated and boosted with Meningitec). The percentage of subjects that completed the Month 72 visit was similar between vaccine groups: 94.3% (150 subjects) of the ACWY-TT group and 96.0% (24 subjects) of the MenCCRM group.

Program ID: Study MenACWY-TT-102(C0921001)/CP EU_DISC_DEMO.SAS. Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 09FEB2018. Runtime ID: 23FEB2018 08:41. File ID: 50_EU_DISC_DEMO.HTM. Immunogenicity Results: The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the persistence of the immune response at Months 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 after a booster vaccination with MenACWY-TT or Meningitec, in terms of the percentage of subjects with rSBA antibody titers 1:8 for each of the 4 serogroups. Table 3 presents the number and percentage of subjects with rSBA titers greater than or equal to the cutoff values (1:8 and 1:128) and GMTs for the adapted ATP cohort. The number of subjects with rSBA results in the MenCCRM group is much smaller than that of the comparisons between the groups. In the ACWY-TT group, the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA titers 1:8 declined from 98.4% at Month 24 to 92.5% at Month 72. For rSBA-MenC, the percentage declined from 97.6% at Month 24 to 71.6% at Month 72. For rSBA-MenW–135, the percentage declined from 96.7% at Month 24 to 85.8% at Month 72. For rSBA-MenY, the percentage was greater than 90% at all subsequent time points, declining from 100.0% at Month 24 to 94.0% at Month 72.

The number of subjects with rSBA results in the MenCCRM group is much smaller than that of the ACWY-TT group (particularly for rSBAs for MenA and MenW–135) limiting the utility of comparisons between the groups. In the ACWY-TT group, the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA titers 1:128 declined from 95.1% at Month 24 to 78.4% at Month 72. For rSBA-MenC, the percentage declined from 74.8% at Month 24 to 40.3% at Month 72. For rSBA-MenW–135, the percentage declined from 94.3% at Month 24 to 67.2% at Month 72. For rSBA-MenY, the percentage was greater than 90% at all subsequent time points, declining from 94.3% at Month 24 to 75.4% at Month 72. In the MenCCRM group, the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenC titers 1:128 was comparable between the ACWY-TT and the MenCCRM groups. In the MenCCRM group, the percentage of subjects with titers 1:128 declined from 85.7% at Month 24 to 34.8% at Month 72. GMTs followed the same trends as described above, and were generally similar between the 2 groups for rSBA-MenC. For the ACWY-TT group, GMTs decreased from Month 24 to Months 36 or 48 and generally remained stable for subsequent time points. In the ACWY-TT group, GMTs for rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW–135, and rSBA-MenY from Months 24 to 72 were 1071.2 to 297.4, 174.5 to 39.6, 859.9 to 171.9, and 734.4 to 260.0, respectively. In the MenCCRM group, GMTs from Months 24 to 72 were 224.3 to 33.0 for rSBA-MenC. Another secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the persistence of meningococcal antibodies in terms of the percentage of subjects with hSBA titers 1:4 and 1:8 and GMTs. The results are presented in Table 4. The number of subjects in the MenCCRM group with hSBA results is much smaller than that of the ACWY-TT group (particularly for hSBAs for MenA, MenW-135, and MenY), limiting the utility of comparisons between the groups. In the ACWY-TT group, the percentage of subjects with hSBA-MenA titers 1:4 declined from 70.0% at Month 24 to 58.5% at Month 72. For hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBA-MenY, the percentages were >90% at all time points, declining slightly from 100.0% at Month 24 for all 3 serogroups to 98.5%, 98.5%, and 97.7% at Month 72, respectively. In the ACWY-TT group, the percentage of subjects with hSBA-MenA titers 1:8 declined from 70.0% at Month 24 to 58.5% at Month 72. For hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBA-MenY, the percentages were >90% at all time points, declining slightly from 99.2% at Month 24 to 97.7% at Month 72, 100.0% at Month 24 to 98.5% at Month 72, and 100.0% at Month 24 to 97.7% at Month 72, respectively. At all time points, the percentage of subjects with hSBA-MenC titers 1:4 and 1:8 was comparable between the ACWY-TT and MenCCRM groups. In the MenCCRM group, the percentage of subjects with titers 1:4 was 100% for all time points. The percentage of 2 groups for hSBA-MenC. For the ACWY-TT group, GMTs decreased from 510.8 at Month 24 to 259.1 at Month 72. In the ACWY-TT group, GMTs for hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBA-MenY from Months 24 to 72 were 33.2 to 14.4, 510.8 to 259.1, 991.3 to 314.4, and 575.4 to 315.6, respectively. The lower limit of the 95% CI was >4 for all serogroups including serogroup A, thereby showing that these subjects were mounted a protective immune response for the entire follow-up period. In the MenCCRM group, GMTs declined from 424.9 at Month 24 to 169.4 at Month 72 for hSBA-MenC. Table 4.

Note: Vaccines were administered at 12 to 23 months of age in primary study MenACWY-TT-039; booster vaccine was administered at 5 years of age in Study MenACWY-TT-048. Note: ACWY-TT = pooled Co-ad and ACWY-TT groups from primary study MenACWY-TT-039 who were primed and boosted with MenACWY-TT (Co-ad group = MenACWY-TT + MMRV vaccine followed by the second dose of MMRV vaccine 84 days later; ACWY-TT group = MenACWY-TT followed by 2 doses of MMRV vaccine 42 and 84 days later). Note: MenCCRM = pooled MMRV and MenCCRM groups from primary study MenACWY-TT-039 who were primed and boosted with Meningitec (MMRV group = MMRV vaccine followed by Meningitec 42 days later and the second dose of MMRV vaccine 84 days later; MenCCRM group = Meningitec followed by 2 doses of MMRV vaccine 42 and 84 days later). a. n = Number of subjects in this reporting group affected by any occurrence of this adverse event, all causalities.b.N = number of subjects in this reporting group at risk. c. % = Percentage of subjects in this reporting group at risk. Program ID: Study MenACWY-TT-102(C0921001)/CP BR_AE.SAS. Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 09FEB2018. Runtime ID: 22FEB2018 16:25. File ID: 47_BR_NSAE_TT48_M72.HTM. Serious Adverse Events No subjects reported SAEs during the reporting period for this study. Deaths No subjects died during the reporting period for this study. study. CONCLUSION(S): Antibody persistence at Years 2 to 6 after booster vaccination was similar for subjects primed and boosted with MenACWY-TT (ACWY-TT group) compared with subjects primed and boosted with Meningitec (MenCCRM group), as measured by the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenC titers and hSBA-MenC titers greater than or equal to predefined cutoff values. For MenACWY-TT, the persistence of the immune response was demonstrated as measured by rSBA and hSBA through 6 years after booster vaccination for the N meningitidis groups A, W–135, and Y in addition to group C. A booster dose of MenACWY-TT maintains protective immune responses through 6 years to all 4 meningococcal groups. No new safety concerns were identified in this extended follow-up study in children who received a booster dose of either MenACWY-TT or Meningitec at 5 years of age (Study 112036 [MenACWY-TT-048]) and were primed with the same vaccination at 12 through 23 months of age (Study 109670 [MenACWY-TT-039]). Overall, the results of the safety and immunogenicity analyses (rSBA and hSBA) at 2 to 6 years after booster vaccination continue to support a favorable benefit-risk assessment of MenACWY-TT in this age group.
