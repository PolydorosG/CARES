Publications: None Study Period: Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 21 October 2021 Study Completion Date (Last Participant Last Visit): 26 February 2022 Rationale: Abrocitinib (PF-04965842) is an orally bioavailable potent Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor with good selectivity over the broader kinome, which is being developed for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Inhibition and induction of the cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2)/2B6/2C19 enzymes by abrocitinib were assessed in human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes. Abrocitinib was a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and a weak inducer of CYP1A2/2B6/2C19 enzymes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of abrocitinib on the in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) of sensitive CYP1A2, 2B6, and 2C19 substrates, i.e., caffeine, efavirenz, and omeprazole, respectively, in healthy participants. Objectives, Endpoints, and Statistical Methods: Study objectives and endpoints are presented in Table S1. Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 inf extrapolated to infinite time; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to the time last of the last quantifiable concentration; CL/F = apparent oral clearance; C = maximum plasma concentration; max EC = ethics committee; PK = pharmacokinetic(s); t = terminal half-life; T = time for C ; V /F = apparent ½ max max z volume of distribution. Statistical Methods used in the study are as follows: Pharmacokinetics: PK parameters (AUC , AUC , C , T , CL/F, V /F, and t ) were derived from the inf last max max z ½ plasma concentration-time profiles. Natural log‑transformed parameters (AUC , AUC , inf last and C ) were analyzed using a mixed effect model with treatment as a fixed effect and max participant as a random effect. Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (Test‑Reference) and corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from the model. The adjusted mean differences and 90% CIs for the differences were exponentiated to provide estimates of the ratio of adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) and 90% CI for the ratios. Safety: AEs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, and safety laboratory data were reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study to evaluate the safety of participants. Any clinical laboratory, ECG, BP, and pulse rate abnormalities of potential clinical concern were to be described. Safety data were presented in tabular format and summarized descriptively. Methodology: This was a Phase 1, open-label, multiple dose, single fixed-sequence, 2-period study to evaluate the effect of abrocitinib on the PK of caffeine, efavirenz, and omeprazole in healthy adult participants. On Day 1 Period 1, participants received single doses of caffeine 100 mg, efavirenz 50 mg, and omeprazole 10 mg together. After 72 hours of PK sampling, Period 2 followed with no washout. On Day 1 through Day 10 of Period 2, participants received abrocitinib 200 mg once daily (QD). In addition to abrocitinib, on Day 2 Period 2, participants received omeprazole 10 mg, and on Day 8 Period 2, participants received caffeine 100 mg, efavirenz 50 mg, and omeprazole 10 mg. PK samples were analyzed in Period 2. Participants remained in the clinical research unit for 15 days and 14 nights for the study. The date of database release for safety and PK data in this study was 22 Mar 2022, with all data reported through the data cutoff date. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): Thirteen participants were planned to be enrolled and 26 participants were assigned and dosed in the study. The study enrolled 13 replacement participants as some of the PK samples from Day 8 Period 2 collected from the initial 13 participants were lost in transit and remaining samples were not evaluable. This replacement is consistent with the protocol. All 26 participants assigned and dosed in the study were included in the Safety Analysis Set. All participants treated with abrocitinib, caffeine, efavirenz, and omeprazole were included in the PK analysis. The 13 initial participants were not included in the descriptive or statistical summaries but were included in the plasma concentration versus time listings and the PK parameter listings. The 13 replacement participants were included in the listings and the descriptive and statistical summaries. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Enrolled in this study were healthy participants ≥18 years of age with body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 32 kg/m2 and a total body weight >50 kg (110 lb). Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): The study interventions were abrocitinib (PF-04965842, provided as 200 mg tablets), caffeine (provided as 100 mg tablets), efavirenz (provided as 50 mg capsules) and omeprazole (provided as 10 mg capsules). On Day 1 Period 1, at approximately 08:00 (±2 hours), caffeine 100 mg, efavirenz 50 mg, and omeprazole 10 mg were administered orally together following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. On Day 1 through Day 10 of Period 2, at approximately 08:00 (±2 hours), abrocitinib 200 mg was administered orally QD. Additionally, on Day 2 Period 2, omeprazole 10 mg was administered orally within approximately 5 minutes after the abrocitinib dose, following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. On Day 8 Period 2, caffeine 100 mg, efavirenz 50 mg, and omeprazole 10 mg were administered orally together within approximately 5 minutes after the abrocitinib dose, following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The information of the study intervention is provided in Table S2. Table S2.

Abrocitinib 200 mg was administered QD on Days 1 through 10 of Period 2. Additionally, a single dose of omeprazole 10 mg was administered on Day 2 Period 2. Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: Fifteen participants were male and 11 were female; 23 were White and 3 were Black or African American. The age of the participants was between 18 and 64 years. The median weight was 76.35 kg (range: 54.6 to 93.4 kg) and the median BMI was 26.72 kg/m2 (range: 20.6 to 30.2 kg/m2). Exposure: On Day 1 Period 1, caffeine 100 mg, efavirenz 50 mg, and omeprazole 10 mg were administered once. On Day 1 through Day 10 of Period 2, abrocitinib 200 mg was administered QD. On Day 2 Period 2, omeprazole 10 mg was administered once. On Day 8 Period 2, caffeine 100 mg, efavirenz 50 mg, and omeprazole 10 mg were administered once. Safety Results: Seven participants experienced 11 all-causality treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), out of which 5 were treatment-related. All TEAEs were mild in severity and all resolved by the end of the study. The most frequently reported all-causality TEAEs by Preferred Term (PT) were tremor and blood pressure increased (reported by 2 [7.7%] participants each) on treatment of caffeine 100 mg + efavirenz 50 mg + omeprazole 10 mg (Days 1 - 3 of Period 1) and abrocitinib 200 mg QD + caffeine 100 mg + efavirenz 50 mg + omeprazole 10 mg (Days 8 – 11 of Period 2), respectively. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAE by PT was tremor on treatment of caffeine 100 mg + efavirenz 50 mg + omeprazole 10 mg (Days 1 - 3 of Period 1). No deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or discontinuations from study/study intervention due to AEs were reported in the study. No dose reduction or temporary discontinuation due to AEs was reported. No clinically meaningful findings in safety laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, ECGs, physical examination assessments were observed in this study. Pharmacokinetic Results: Caffeine: Caffeine PK parameters are summarized descriptively in Table S3. Caffeine exposure as assessed by area under the plasma concentration-time profile (AUC, i.e., AUC corrected inf for residual concentrations [AUC CR] and AUC corrected for residual concentrations inf last [AUC CR]) was higher when co-administered with multiple doses of abrocitinib compared last to when caffeine was dosed alone, whereas C corrected for residual concentrations max (C CR) was similar between both treatments (Table S4). max Tmax (hr) 1.00 (0.50 - 2.00) 0.92 (0.42 - 2.92)  Efavirenz: Efavirenz PK parameters are summarized descriptively in Table S5. Terminal elimination t , ½ AUC , and apparent CL/F values could not be determined per pre-defined criteria. Efavirenz inf exposure as assessed by AUC CR and C CR were similar when co-administered with last max multiple doses of abrocitinib compared to when efavirenz was dosed alone (Table S6).  Omeprazole: Omeprazole PK parameters are summarized descriptively in Table S7. Omeprazole exposure as assessed by both AUC (i.e., AUC and AUC ) and C increased when inf last max co-administrated with multiple doses of abrocitinib compared to when omeprazole was dosed alone (Table S8). Conclusions: Safety:  Abrocitinib, when co-administered with caffeine, efavirenz, and omeprazole, was generally safe and well-tolerated in healthy adult participants. Pharmacokinetics:  Caffeine exposure as assessed by AUC was higher when co-administered with multiple doses of abrocitinib compared to when caffeine was dosed alone, whereas C was similar between both treatments. The ratios of the adjusted geometric means max (90% CI) AUC CR, AUC CR, and C CR of caffeine were 139.59% (121.98%, inf last max 159.74%), 132.64% (119.25%, 147.53%), and 101.22% (92.21%, 111.12%), respectively, when caffeine was co-administered with multiple doses of abrocitinib (test) as compared to administered alone (reference). Hence, abrocitinib is not an inducer of CYP1A2.  Efavirenz exposure as assessed by AUC CR and C CR were similar when last max dosed alone. The ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% CI) AUC CR and last C CR of efavirenz were 110.10% (103.45%, 117.17%) and 97.26% (83.25%, max 113.62%), respectively, when efavirenz was co-administered with multiple doses of abrocitinib (test) as compared to administered alone (reference), indicating that abrocitinib is not an inducer of CYP2B6.  Omeprazole exposure as assessed by both AUC and C increased when max co-administrated with multiple doses of abrocitinib compared to when omeprazole was dosed alone. The ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% CI) AUC , inf AUC , and C of omeprazole were 288.81% (240.56%, 346.73%), 291.31% last max (241.95%, 350.75%), and 234.16% (170.19%, 322.17%), respectively, when omeprazole was co-administered with multiple doses of abrocitinib (test) as compared to administered alone (reference). Hence, abrocitinib is a moderate inhibitor but not an inducer of CYP2C19.
