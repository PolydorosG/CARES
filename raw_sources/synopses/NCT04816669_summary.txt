SYNOPSIS Clinical Study Report Title: Final Report: A Phase 3, Randomized, Observer-Blind Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Multiple Formulations of the Vaccine Candidate BNT162b2 Against COVID-19 in Healthy Adults 18 Through 55 Years of Age Study Number: C4591020 Regulatory Agency or Public Disclosure Identifier Number: 2020-002641-42 (NCT04816669) Study Phase: Phase 3 Name of Study Intervention: BNT162b2 RNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccines, Compound Number: PF-07302048 Sponsor/Sponsor Agent: BioNTech SE/Pfizer Inc. CSR Version and Report Date: Final CSR Version 1.0, 25 October 2022 Number of Study Centers and Investigators: This study was conducted at 20 sites in the United States. A list of study centers and investigators involved in this study is provided in Appendix 16.1.4.1. Publications: None Study Period: The analyses presented are based on a first participant first visit date of 01 April 2021 and study completion date of 01 December 2021. This study was neither discontinued nor interrupted. Rationale: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the immune response induced by the refrigerator-stable lyophilized formulation of BNT162b2 was noninferior to the frozen-liquid formulation of BNT162b2 in multidose vials (MDVs), and to describe the safety and tolerability of these different vaccine formulations in healthy adults, thereby supporting refrigerated storage and distribution at a commercial scale. The study also described the safety and immunogenicity of frozen-liquid BNT162b2 with lipid nanoparticle (LNP) size at the upper end of specification and ready-to-use (RTU) BNT162b2. Current clinical and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) specifications for LNP size for the frozen-liquid formulation are , respectively. Clinical experience, however, is limited to LNP size in the range of , based on lots used in the clinical studies already conducted. Hence, an exploratory study arm is being included to better understand the impact of LNP size, using a lot with LNP size close to the upper specification boundary (without any significant impact on other quality attributes). The LNP size at the upper end of specification for the frozen-liquid BNT162b2 was intended to use a lot close to the upper specification boundary compared with the typical size range of for the RTU BNT162b2 (immediate manufacturing precursor of the lyophilized formulation). An exploratory study arm was included to describe the safety and immunogenicity of the RTU. The primary immunogenicity analysis demonstrated that the immune response elicited by the lyophilized formulation did not meet the noninferiority criterion compared with the frozen-liquid formulation of BNT162b2. As a result, for the benefit of the participants, all study participants who received 2 doses of the lyophilized formulation were offered an additional vaccine dose, using the 30-µg dose of the frozen-liquid formulation of BNT162b2. Objectives, Endpoints, and Statistical Methods: Study objectives, estimands, and endpoints are presented in Table S1. Table S1. Study Objectives, Estimands, and Endpoints Table S1. Study Objectives, Estimands, and Endpoints Table S1. Study Objectives, Estimands, and Endpoints Immunogenicity: The GMR was calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results between 2 vaccine groups and exponentiating the mean. Two-sided 95% CIs were obtained by calculating CIs using Student’s t-distribution for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the confidence limits. Noninferiority was declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR of lyophilized SDV relative to the corresponding frozen-liquid MDV control is greater than 0.67 (1.5-fold criterion). Geometric means were calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the logarithm transformation and then exponentiating the mean to express results on the original scale. Two-sided 95% CIs were obtained by taking log transforms of assay results, calculating the 95% CI with reference to Student’s t-distribution, and then exponentiating the confidence limits. GMFRs were calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results (later time point minus earlier time point) and exponentiating the mean. The associated 2-sided 95% CIs were obtained by constructing CIs using Student’s t-distribution Subgroup analyses of immunogenicity were conducted by sex and race for Part 1 of the study. GMCs of full-length S-binding IgG concentrations and associated 2-sided 95% CIs at baseline and 1 month after Dose 2 were summarized by vaccine group for each subgroup. Safety: The safety analyses were based on the safety population. Participants were summarized by vaccine group according to the study interventions they received. Descriptive statistics were provided for each reactogenicity endpoint for each vaccine group, including counts and percentages of participants with the indicated endpoint and associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs. AEs and SAEs were categorized according to MedDRA terms. Counts, percentages, and associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs of AEs and SAEs were provided for each vaccine group. Descriptive summary statistics for the following endpoints were provided by vaccine group for each subgroup:  Proportion of participants reporting local reactions, by maximum severity level.  Proportion of participants reporting systemic events, by maximum severity level.  Proportion of participants reporting AEs within 1 month after Dose 2, by system organ class and preferred term. Methodology: This was a Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of multiple formulations of BNT162b2, an RNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, administered on a 2-dose schedule in healthy adults 18 through 55 years of age. The study was conducted in the United States (US) with potential to expand to other countries. In Part 1, approximately 550 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lyophilized BNT162b2 in an SDV or frozen-liquid BNT162b2 in an MDV (phosphate- buffered saline [PBS]) as a control for the lyophilized SDV formulation. In Part 2, approximately 60 participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either frozen-liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification (PBS) or RTU BNT162b2 (tris/sucrose). The duration of the study for each participant was approximately 2 months, with a total of approximately 610 randomized participants. Approximately 488 evaluable participants were Based on updates from Protocol Amendment 2, all participants who originally received 2 doses of the lyophilized formulation of BNT162b2 were offered the opportunity to receive a third dose at least 90 days after Dose 2 with the current frozen-liquid formulation of BNT162b2. Those participants who accepted the offer to receive a third dose had 2 additional visits. The study duration was extended for 1 additional month for those participants who accepted the offer to receive a third dose. Number of Participants (Planned and Analyzed): In Part 1, approximately 550 participants were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lyophilized BNT162b2 in a SDV or frozen-liquid BNT162b2 in an MDV (PBS) as a control for the lyophilized SDV formulation. Overall, 559 participants were enrolled, received study intervention, and included in the safety population. The evaluable immunogenicity population included 464 (83.0%) participants. In Part 2, approximately 60 participants were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either frozen-liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification (PBS) or RTU BNT162b2 (tris/sucrose). Overall, 70 participants were enrolled, received study intervention, and included in the safety population. The evaluable immunogenicity population included 52 (74.3%) participants. For participants who received Dose 3 of BNT162b2 (frozen-liquid MDV), 114 participants received study intervention and were included in the safety population. The Dose 3 evaluable immunogenicity population included 88 (77.2%) participants.

Duration of Study Intervention: Study intervention for Part 1 was 2 doses of lyophilized BNT162b2 in an SDV (30 µg) or frozen-liquid BNT162b2 in an MDV (30 µg) (PBS). Study intervention for Part 2 was 2 doses of frozen-liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification (30 µg) or RTU BNT162b2 (30 µg). For participants who originally received 2 doses of lyophilized BNT162b2 in an SDV (30 µg), these participants were eligible to receive 1 dose (Dose 3) of frozen-liquid MDV BNT162b2 30 µg. Summary of Results – Part 1 – Lyophilized BNT162b2 in SDVs and Frozen-Liquid BNT162b2 in MDVs: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: Demographic characteristics were similar in the lyophilized SDV and frozen-liquid MDV groups. Overall, most participants were White, non-Hispanic/non-Latino, with a median age of 34.0 years. Exposure: In Part 1, there were 279 (100%) and 280 (100%) participants who received Dose 1 and 276 (98.9%) and 277 (98.9%) who received Dose 2 of lyophilized in SDV and frozen-liquid MDV BNT162b2 30 μg, respectively. Immunogenicity Results:  Lyophilized BNT162b2 in SDVs did not meet noninferiority criterion when compared with frozen-liquid BNT162b2 in MDVs.  Lyophilized BNT162b2 in SDVs and frozen-liquid BNT162b2 in MDVs elicited an immune response as assessed by SARS-CoV-2 full-length S-binding IgG levels. GMCs and GMFRs in the frozen-liquid MDV group were greater than those for the lyophilized SDV group. Safety Results:  Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction in both groups after each dose and was slightly higher in the frozen-liquid MDV group compared with the lyophilized SDV group. Local reactions were similar in frequency after each dose for redness and swelling in both groups. Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity and short-lived.  The frequencies of most systemic events after each dose were generally higher in the frozen-liquid MDV group compared with the lyophilized SDV group, and fatigue and headache were most frequently reported. Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity and short-lived. After Dose 2, 1 participant in the lyophilized SDV group and 5 participants in the frozen-liquid MDV group reported fever >38.9°C to 40.0°C.  The frequency of participants with any AE from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 was similar in the lyophilized SDV and frozen-liquid MDV groups. There were no SAEs or deaths. One participant in each group had AEs leading to withdrawal. Summary of Results – Part 2 – Frozen-Liquid BNT162b2 with LNP Size at the Upper End of Specification (LNP Size) (PBS) and RTU BNT162b2 (Tris/Sucrose): Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: Demographic characteristics in Part 2 were similar in the frozen-liquid (LNP size) and RTU groups. Overall, most participants were White, non-Hispanic/non-Latino, with a median age of 30.0 years. Exposure: In Part 2, all 35 (100%) participants in each of the frozen-liquid (LNP size) and RTU groups received Doses 1 and 2. Immunogenicity Results:  Frozen-liquid BNT162b2 with LNP size at the upper end of specification and RTU BNT162b2 formulations elicited robust immune response as assessed by SARS-CoV-2 full-length S-binding IgG levels. GMCs and GMFRs in the frozen-liquid (LNP size) group were slightly higher than those in the RTU group, although the sample size was small in this part of the study. Safety Results:  Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction in both groups after each dose and was slightly higher in the frozen-liquid (LNP size) group compared with the RTU group. Redness and swelling were not reported in the frozen-liquid BNT162b2 (LNP size) group and infrequently reported in the RTU group (no redness reported after Dose 2). Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity and short- lived.  The frequencies of most systemic events after each dose were generally similar in the frozen-liquid (LNP size) and RTU groups, and fatigue and headache were most frequently reported. Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity and short- lived.  The frequency of participants with any AE from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 was similar in the frozen-liquid (LNP size) and RTU groups. There were no SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths. Summary of Results – Participants Who Received Dose 3 of BNT162b2 (Frozen-Liquid MDV): Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: In Part 3, most participants were White, non-Hispanic/non-Latino, with a median age of 36.0 years Exposure: There were 114 participants who received 2 doses of lyophilized BNT162b2 30 μg and received Dose 3 of BNT162b2 (frozen-liquid MDV). Immunogenicity Results:  Dose 3 of frozen-liquid BNT162b2 in MDVs elicited robust immune response as assessed by SARS-CoV-2 full-length S-binding IgG levels. The GMC at 1 month after Dose 3 was approximately 3-fold of those observed at 1 month after Dose 2, and the GMFR from before Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 was 16.0. Safety Results:  Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction after Dose 3 of frozen-liquid MDV BNT162b2. Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity and short-lived.  Fatigue, headache, chills, muscle pain, and joint pain were the most frequently reported systemic events. Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity and short-lived.  The frequency of participants with any AE from Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 was generally low (8.8%). There were no SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths. Conclusions: Immune responses were observed after administration of 2 doses of the lyophilized SDV, frozen-liquid MDV, or RTU formulations of BNT162b2 30 µg, although the lyophilized formulation did not meet noninferiority criterion compared with the frozen-liquid MDV formulation. BNT162b2 drug product with a larger LNP size showed similar SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding IgG responses as the RTU BNT162b2, which supports the current acceptance criterion for drug product particle size. Participants who received 2 doses of the lyophilized formulation and received Dose 3 of the frozen-liquid MDV had a boosted response based on GMCs and GMFRs. Local reactions and systemic events commonly observed in all 3 formulations were short-lived, and the safety profile was tolerable.
