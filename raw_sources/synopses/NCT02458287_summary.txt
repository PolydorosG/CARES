Study Initiation Date and Final Completion Date: Study Initiation Date: 09 June 2015 Final Completion Date: 03 February 2016 Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Primary Objectives:  To demonstrate a superior low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering effect of bococizumab 150 mg administered by the subcutaneous (SC) route every 2 weeks (Q2W) compared to placebo 150 mg, in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia receiving statin therapy and whose LDL-C was 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L).  To estimate for the bococizumab 150 mg dose group, the proportion of subjects who were able to successfully operate the autoinjector combination product, based on the Participant Assessment Tool (PAT), when administered at the designated injection sites (abdomen, arm, or thigh) and to identify and describe any unsuccessful attempts to operate the autoinjector. Secondary Objectives:  To estimate for the bococizumab 75 mg dose group, and for the combined bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg dose groups, the proportion of subjects who were able to successfully operate the autoinjector combination product, based on the PAT, when administered at unsuccessful attempts to operate the autoinjector.  To estimate for the bococizumab 150 mg dose group, the bococizumab 75 mg dose group, and for the combined bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg dose groups, the proportion of subjects who were able to successfully operate the autoinjector combination product based on the Observer Assessment Tool (OAT).  To demonstrate a superior LDL-C lowering effect of bococizumab 75 mg administered by the SC route Q2W compared to placebo 75 mg, in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia receiving statin therapy and whose LDL-C was 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L).  To demonstrate a superior effect of bococizumab 150 mg administered by the SC route Q2W on total cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-[HDL]-C) compared to placebo 150 mg and of bococizumab 75 mg administered by the SC route Q2W compared to placebo 75 mg, in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia receiving statin therapy and whose LDL-C was 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L).  To compare the safety and tolerability of bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg administered by the SC route Q2W to placebo, in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia receiving statin therapy and whose LDL-C was 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L).  To assess the immunogenicity of bococizumab.  To determine plasma bococizumab and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) concentrations. METHODS Study Design: This study was a 12-week, Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study designed to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and actual use of bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg SC Q2W with an autoinjector (pre-filled pen) for LDL-C lowering in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. The study planned to randomize approximately 300 subjects in 4 treatment groups, randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to the active treatment and placebo arms (active treatment: approximately 100 subjects in each; placebo: approximately 50 subjects in each). After providing consent, subjects entered a screening period of approximately 28 days to verify eligibility for the study. Eligible subjects were considered enrolled and progressed to the randomization visit. Results from screening evaluations were reviewed and only subjects who continued to meet all eligibility criteria were randomized to treatment. Randomized subjects then entered the 12-week treatment period, followed by a 6-week follow-up, for a total of approximately 22 weeks of study participation. Lipid levels were blinded to the Table 1. A schematic of the study design is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.

The study planned to randomize approximately 300 subjects in 4 treatment groups, randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to the active treatment and placebo arms (active treatment: approximately 100 subjects in each; placebo: approximately 50 subjects in each). There were 416 subjects screened for this study. During the study, 299 subjects were randomized to study drug and analyzed for efficacy (full analysis set [FAS]). All randomized subjects (299 subjects [100.0%]) received at least 1 dose of study drug (safety analysis set); 50 subjects received placebo 150 mg, 100 subjects received bococizumab 150 mg, 49 subjects received placebo 75 mg, and 100 subjects received bococizumab 75 mg. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Males and females 18 years of age with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia requiring treatment with a statin were eligible for inclusion in this study. Subjects were required to be on a stable dose of either simvastatin 40 mg or higher, rosuvastatin 10 mg or higher, atorvastatin 20 mg or higher, or pravastatin 40 mg or higher for at least 6 weeks prior to screening. There should have been no plans at the time of screening and randomization to modify the dose of statin for the duration of the study. Subjects who were on a background treatment with a statin at the 2 screening visits had to have fasting LDL-C 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at all screening visits and the value at the second screening visit within 7 days of randomization must not have differed by >20% of this initial value. If the fasting LDL-C at the second screening visit was lower or higher than 20% of the initial value, LDL-C could be repeated once (no more than 7 days prior to randomization), and the subject was eligible if the value of this repeat test was within 20% (inclusive) of the value for the second screening visit. Subjects had to have fasting triglyceride (TG) 400 mg/dL (4.51 mmol/L) at the second screening visit. Exclusions from the study included subjects with: a history of a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event or procedure during the past 90 days, history of congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association functional Class IV, or left ventricular ejection fraction measured by imaging <25%, and poorly controlled hypertension at any screening visit or at randomization. Pregnant females, breastfeeding females, male and female subjects of childbearing potential who were unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception for the duration of the study and for at least 63 days after the last dose of investigational product were excluded from the study. Study Treatment: Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 parallel groups:  Bococizumab 150 mg SC Q2W;  Bococizumab 75 mg SC Q2W;  Placebo 150 mg SC Q2W; 43, 57, and 71 (-1/+4 day dosing window). Subjects or caregivers were trained in self-administration of injections during screening. Bococizumab or placebo for bococizumab was injected into either an upper or lower quadrant of the abdominal wall, upper thigh, or upper arm. Subjects were encouraged to rotate sites of administration. Subjects could also on occasion, if available, have had a caregiver administer the study drug or have a caregiver administer all doses throughout the study. The upper arm was suitable only for caregiver administration and not for self-administration. Efficacy Endpoints: Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  The percent change from baseline (CFB) in fasting LDL-C at Week 12 for the bococizumab 150 mg dose group compared with placebo 150 mg.  The delivery system success rate (DSSR), defined as the percent of subjects whose attempt to operate the system met the definition of successful, as assessed using the PAT, at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, for the bococizumab 150 mg dose administered at the designated injection sites (abdomen, arm, or thigh). Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  The DSSR for both the bococizumab 75 mg dose and combined bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg doses administered at the designated injections site (abdomen, arm, or thigh).  Percent of subjects whose attempt to operate the system met the definition of successful, as assessed using the OAT at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 for both the bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg dose and the combined bococizumab doses.  Percent CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 12 for the bococizumab 75 mg dose group compared with the placebo 75 mg dose group.  Percent CFB in fasting TC, ApoB, and non-HDL-C at Week 12 for the bococizumab 150 mg dose group compared with placebo 150 mg and for the bococizumab 75 mg dose group compared with placebo 75 mg. Non-HDL-C was calculated as the difference between TC and HDL-C, both collected on the same day: non-HDL-C = TC - HDL-C. All other lipid parameters were measured by the direct method. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Endpoints: Week 12 plasma bococizumab concentration and PCSK9 concentration were secondary endpoints. Safety was assessed by physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory results, and the reporting of adverse events (AEs) in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. In addition, blood samples were collected for immunogenicity assessment of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Safety endpoints included incidence and severity of AEs (including injection site reactions) and incidence of ADAs and nAbs. All medical device complaints regardless of whether the medical device complaint was associated with an AE were collected. Statistical Methods: The FAS was the analysis set for the analysis of efficacy data in this study. The FAS included all subjects who were randomized. Subjects were analyzed according to their randomized treatment group. Analysis of Primary Endpoint: Percent CFB at Week 12 in fasting LDL-C for bococizumab 150 mg compared with placebo 150 mg was analyzed with a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The dependent variable in the model was the percent CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12. The model included treatment group, the scheduled visit time point, baseline LDL-C, interaction of treatment and the scheduled visit time point, and interaction of baseline LDL-C and the scheduled visit time point. No imputation of missing data was performed. All LDL-C measurements were included in the primary analyses regardless of treatment compliance. Treatment comparisons were made at the specified time points of interest. To support the robustness of the conclusions drawn from this analysis, several sensitivity analyses were performed. The primary MMRM model was applied to data collected while on treatment, essentially excluding data collected while subjects were off-drug-in-study (ODIS). The primary MMRM model was also applied to imputed datasets utilizing a multiple imputation approach with observed or imputed values for every windowed post-baseline visit up to and including Week 12, a pattern mixture approach where the active treatment group’s imputations were based upon estimates from the placebo group, and a center-at-baseline approach that followed the standard multiple imputation approach except missing percent CFB lipid data for the active-treatment group while off treatment were imputed with a normal random variable with mean zero and variance taken from the primary MMRM model. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach was also applied to the last observation carried forward (LOCF) as a sensitivity analysis. DSSR for bococizumab 150 mg group for observed data (ie, no imputation of missing data) was analyzed using descriptive statistics by the number and percent of successful injections for the bococizumab 150 mg dose group at the planned analysis window (Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) and during the treatment period (across visits) as recorded in the PAT. Missing data were imputed based on combination of failed injection and LOCF for the analysis at the subject attempted to inject multiple times within the same dosing window. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints: The percent CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 12 was also analyzed for the bococizumab 75 mg group compared with the corresponding placebo group as a secondary efficacy analysis. The following secondary parameters were analyzed in the bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg groups compared with the corresponding placebo groups: fasting TC, ApoB, and non-HDL-C at Week 12. The primary MMRM model was also applied for these analyses. The observed, CFB, and percent CFB in the continuous endpoints were summarized by treatment group and visit. Additionally, graphical summaries were provided for the observed, CFB, and percent CFB over time as well as MMRM estimated percent CFB over time, and MMRM estimated treatment group differences over time. The DSSR secondary endpoints were examined in the bococizumab 75 mg and combined bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg treatment groups compared to the corresponding placebo group for the planned visit window (Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) and during the treatment period (across weeks). Successful injections based on OAT were calculated for bococizumab 150 mg dose, 75 mg dose, and combined bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg doses for planned analysis window (Weeks 0, 4, and 8) and during the treatment period (across weeks). Missing data were imputed based on combination of failed injection and LOCF as described for the primary DSSR analysis for the analysis at the planned analysis window. Only observed data (ie, no imputation of missing data) were used for both the analysis by week (Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 for PAT, and Weeks 0, 4, and 8 for OAT) and for the analysis during the overall treatment period (across weeks). Sensitivity analysis was explored to understand the pattern of successful injections by summarizing the number and percent of successful injections (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more) for DSSR based on PAT and with 0, 1, 2, 3, or more successful injections recorded in the OAT. If any subject had more than 6 injections for PAT or more than 3 injections for OAT, the injections were included in this analyses. These analyses were based upon using only the available data (ie, no imputation of missing data). Analysis of Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data:  Descriptive summaries and mean plots of plasma bococizumab and PCSK9 concentrations. Analysis of Safety Parameters: The safety analysis set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version (v)18.1 was used to classify all AEs with respect to system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Subjects were analyzed according to their randomized treatment group regardless of adherence to study drug. AEs were summarized separately for those events with onset during the treatment or follow-up period using an infinite lag. AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation from treatment, provided by severity and relationship to study therapy. Deaths were listed individually. In addition, a 3-tier approach was used to summarize AEs. Tier-1 AEs were AEs of special clinical interest specified in the Safety Review Plan, including hypersensitivity reactions and severe injection site AEs. For these events, the percent of subjects with AEs, the risk difference versus placebo, the associated 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-value were provided. The CIs and p-values were not adjusted for multiplicity and were provided for screening purposes only. Tier-2 AEs were those AEs that were common, occurring in 5% of subjects in any treatment group. For these events, the percent of subjects with AEs, the risk difference versus placebo and the associated 95% CI were provided. The CIs were for estimation purposes only. All AEs were Tier-3 events and were summarized as described above. SAE presentations were derived from a combination of data in the clinical study database and the corporate safety database. The corporate safety database was a separate, centralized, AE monitoring database that was continuously updated based on rapidly communicated reports from the investigators to the sponsor. Immunogenicity Analysis:  Incidence of ADAs and nAbs. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition is summarized in Table 2. Of the 416 subjects screened for study participation, 299 subjects were randomized to study drug and analyzed for efficacy (FAS).

At the last injection time point (Week 10), 98.0% and 97.0% of injection attempts were successful for the bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg dose, respectively, based on subject assessment and 100% of injections were successful based on the observer assessment at the last observed time point (Week 8).  The study showed that the bococizumab 75 mg treatment also resulted in a greater LDL-C lowering effect compared with placebo 75 mg (adjusted mean treatment group difference of -43.0% [95% CI: -51.9, -34.0]) at Week 12. Other lipid parameters of TC, ApoB, and non-HDL-C for the 150 mg and 75 mg bococizumab treatment groups also showed reductions from baseline compared with placebo at Week 12.  Mean (SD) bococizumab plasma concentrations of 6.68 (6.169) g/mL and 2.08 (1.413) g/mL were observed in the bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg groups, respectively, at Week 12.  Mean (SD) plasma total PCSK9 percent CFB of 862.9% (384.93%), and 796.2% (566.92%) were observed in bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg dose groups, respectively compared with values of 9.9% (46.14%) and 20.7% (48.46%) for the corresponding placebo groups at Week 12.  Bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg treatment were well tolerated, with similar overall AEs as the placebo groups. AE rates across treatment groups and placebo were similar. No treatment-related AEs were recorded by >2 subjects in either the bococizumab 150 mg or 75 mg groups.  Incidence of SAEs was low and similar across treatment groups. There were no subject deaths during the study.  The overall incidence of ADAs was 39.2% and 22.2% for the bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg treatment groups, respectively. The overall incidence of nAbs was 18.6% and 11.1% for the bococizumab 150 mg and 75 mg treatment groups, respectively.
