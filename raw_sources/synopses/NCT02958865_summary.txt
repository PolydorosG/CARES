The study consisted of a screening period of up to 6 weeks, an 8-week double-blind induction period, an additional 24-week open-label active chronic dosing period followed by a 4-week follow-up period after the last dose of investigational product for a total of 36 weeks. The study design is illustrated in Figure S1. Figure S1. Schematic of Study Design for Protocol B7981005 Abbreviation: PBO=placebo Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Adult male and/or female participants who had moderate to severe active UC (endoscopic and histological diagnosis for ≥3 months prior to entry into the study) as defined by a total Mayo score of ≥6, with a rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 and an endoscopic subscore of ≥2, were to be included in the study. Study Treatment: Participants received ritlecitinib (10 mg and 50 mg oral tablets), brepocitinib (5 mg and 25 mg oral tablets) or matching placebos (Table S2) as once daily (QD) dosing according to their assigned treatment regimen (as illustrated in Figure S1) for 8 weeks during the induction period and an additional 24 weeks during the chronic dosing period for a total of 32 weeks. Participants were to take the assigned medication in the morning whenever possible with ambient temperature water to a total volume of approximately 240 mL. In this synopsis, the compound numbers “PF-06651600” and “PF-06700841”, and the corresponding generic names “ritlecitinib” and “brepocitinib” are used interchangeably. 17-00117417-002907  Efficacy Evaluations: Efficacy evaluations, including endpoints derived from: Total Mayo Score: The Mayo score measures disease activity for UC. Total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 points and consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency [SF], rectal bleeding [RB], endoscopy score [ES] and physician’s global assessment [PGA]). Endpoints based on the total Mayo scores are defined below:  Remission: total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 and excluding any friability.  Clinical response: decrease from baseline in total Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point or absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1.  Deep remission: total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a 0 on both endoscopic and rectal bleeding subscore.  Symptomatic remission: total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point, and both rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores of 0.  Modified remission: based on modified Mayo score (total Mayo score minus PGA) with endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 and rectal bleeding subscore of 0.  Improvement in endoscopic appearance: endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1.  Endoscopic remission: endoscopic subscore of 0.  Endoscopic response: decrease from baseline in the endoscopic subscore of 1 point or more. Partial Mayo Score: Partial Mayo score is defined as the Mayo score without the endoscopic subscore, and ranges from 0 to 9. On dosing days, the partial Mayo score was assessed prior to administration of investigational product. Response based on change in partial Mayo score is defined as a decrease from baseline of at least 2 points, while remission is defined as an absolute value of partial Mayo score <2 points with no individual subscore >1. Endoscopic Index: Endoscopy subscores were reported per Mayo score based on Central Reader, and for Mayo endoscopy subscore of 1, presence or absence of friability were noted. Histologic Index: Outcomes based on histology endpoints included histologic improvement (<5% crypt involvement of neutrophils in epithelium [Geboes ≤3.1]); histologic remission (no crypt involvement in epithelium [Geboes ≤3.0]); mucosal healing which includes endoscopic improvement + histologic improvement (Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1 and Geboes ≤3.1). Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) for Health Outcomes Assessment: PROs were assessed by Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Short Form-36, version 2, acute (SF-36 v2), Euro Quality of Life Questionnaire – 5 Dimensions-3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) and Visual Analog Scale (EQ-5D VAS). Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) Evaluations: PK: Plasma concentrations of ritlecitinib and brepocitinib from blood sample at PK time-points specified in the schedule of activities of the protocol were collected and analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each participant and each treatment. Samples below the lower limit of quantification were set to 0 for analysis. PD: Blood samples were collected for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), immunoglobulins, fecal calprotectin, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), stool microbiome, protein analysis (biopsy) and mRNA (blood and biopsy) analysis. Samples were analyzed using fit for purpose or validated analytical methods in compliance with Pfizer SOPs. The results of the microbiome, protein and mRNA analysis are not included in this final synopsis. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse event (AE) monitoring, laboratory evaluations, other safety measures (pregnancy test, serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], C.difficile test, infection monitoring [viral, bacterial, and fungal], viral surveillance, medical history, physical examination, vital signs, audiogram, electrocardiogram [ECG]). Statistical Methods: Efficacy Analysis The intent-to-treat (ITT) dataset was used for primary efficacy analysis. An ITT analysis set was included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of PF-06651600, PF-06700841, or placebo. Analysis of observations in the chronic period, a modified intent-to-treat dataset (mITT) was used for all the efficacy, PRO and histology outcomes. In general, number and percent were presented for categorical variables. number, mean, standard deviation (SD) (or standard error [SE] of the mean), median, minimum, and maximum were presented for continuous variables. For the analysis of the total Mayo score it was calculated by adding the four components: SF, RB, ES and PGA. The SF subcomponent was calculated based on vendor selected 3 diary dates. First the 3 diary days of stool count is averaged, next the screening normal stool count prior to UC flare is subtracted, and finally the subtracted stool count is mapped to the final stool frequency subscore (0-3). Please note that for the screening a slightly different SF calculation was used. This calculation was implemented by the vendor at the beginning of the study. First, we subtract the screening normal stool count (prior to flare) to the stool count for each of 3 selected diary dates. Then the subtracted stool count is mapped to the stool frequency value per statistical analysis plan (SAP) appendix for all 3 diary dates. Finally, the 3 mapped stool frequency subscore will be averaged to get the final stool frequency subscore. For continuous efficacy endpoints: descriptive statistics were used to provide estimates (with confidence intervals [CIs] based on Wald’s method) of expected continuous outcome for each treatment group and difference between the expected values of outcomes in the treatment group of interest and reference treatment group; the constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) was used to provide improved estimates in comparison to the ones provided by the descriptive statistics; the longitudinal mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) modeling was used to provide an alternative and qualitatively similar estimates to the estimates provided by the cLDA method. The cLDA method was the primary analysis for the primary endpoint total Mayo score. The MMRM and descriptive statistics are supportive analyses. For binary efficacy endpoints, Blyth-Still-Casella method provided CIs of proportions of response for each treatment group and Chan and Zhang method provided CIs for the difference between the response in the treatment group of interest and reference treatment group. The CIs for one sample proportions were based on Blyth Still Casella. These analyses were applied to all binary outcomes at all visits. Bayesian Emax modeling was used for the analysis of dose dependence of the probability of remission based on total Mayo score. The stratum-adjusted difference in probabilities of binary endpoints (eg, remission, endoscopic improvement, etc) between the treatment group of interest and reference treatment group was based on the approach described by Mehrotra and Railkar. For categorical endpoints, the frequency and percentage for each category were presented. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used for the missing binary data. For the continuous outcomes observed data were used for the analysis. The participants that have data missing due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the chronic period were removed from the analysis (eg, not included into numerator and denominator in the calculation of proportion of responders). PK Analysis The PK concentration population is defined as all enrolled participants who received at least one dose of PF-06651600 or PF-06700841 and in whom at least one concentration value was Safety Analysis The safety analysis set was defined as those participants who received at least one dose of PF-06651600, PF-06700841, or placebo. All safety data were summarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulations, descriptive statistics, categorical summaries, and graphical presentations. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 637 participants were screened from 154 sites across 19 countries, among whom 319 participants were randomized and 317 participants were treated. The evaluation groups of participants are summarized for both induction and chronic periods in Figure S2. The main reasons for discontinuation from treatment and study in induction period were AE and withdrawal by participant. The most common reasons for treatment and study discontinuations in chronic period were lack of efficacy, AE and withdrawal by participant. Induction Period The 317 treated study participants consisted of 182 (57.4%) males and 135 (42.6%) females, with a mean age of 40.3 years. The majority of participants were White (93.1%). Most of the study participants were non-smokers (65.0%) and had no current alcohol use (73.2%). The mean (SD) weight and body mass index (BMI) for the overall population were 73.2 (17.18) kg and 24.7 (5.04) kg/m2, respectively. All 7 treatment groups were comparable at baseline with respect to age, gender, weight, BMI, smoking status and alcohol use. A total of 168 (53.0%) participants were biologic naïve (with no prior treatments of anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF], anti-integrin or ustekinumab): 64% in the placebo, 54.9%-60.0% in the ritlecitinib treatment groups, 29.8%-55.3% in the brepocitinib treatment groups. Approximately 60% of the treated participants were anti-TNF naïve: 64.0% in the placebo, 64.0%-71.4% in the ritlecitinib treatment groups, 34.0%-66.0% in the brepocitinib treatment groups; Approximately 70% of the treated participants were anti-integrin naïve: 76.0% in the placebo, 66.7%-80.0% in the ritlecitinib treatment groups, 51.1%-75.0% in the brepocitinib treatment groups. During the induction period, concomitant steroids were reported in 135 (42.6%) participants, and among whom 132 (97.8%) participants had stable use of steroids since baseline and 3 (2.2%) participants (1 each in the ritlecitinib 20 mg, 200 mg and brepocitinib 60 mg treatment groups) reported dose changes. Four (1.3%) participants (2 in the ritlecitinib 70 mg treatment group, 1 each in the ritlecitinib 200 mg and brepocitinib 10 mg treatment groups) with no steroid use at baseline reported concomitant steroid use during the induction period. The median systemic steroid dose (equivalent to prednisone) during the induction period was 20 mg/day and similar across different treatment groups. Chronic Period A total of 280 participants were treated during the chronic period. There were generally more males than females in all treatment groups except for the placeboritlecitinib 50 mg and ritlecitinib 70 mg50 mg treatment groups. All treatment groups (both ritlecitinib and brepocitinib) were comparable at baseline with respect to age, smoking status and alcohol use. The proportions of anti-TNF and biologic naïve participants were 60.4% and 53.2%, respectively. For ritlecitinib, the proportions of anti-TNF (60.0%-72.2%) and biologic naïve participants (58.3%-61.5%) were similar across all treatment groups; For brepocitinib, a lower proportion of anti-TNF and biologic naïve participants was observed in the 30 mg30 mg treatment group (37.8% and 35.1%, respectively) compared to other brepocitinib treatment groups (≥53.8% and ≥48.7%, respectively). During the chronic period, at baseline, concomitant steroid use was reported in 121 (43.2%) participants, and among whom 79 (65.3%) participants had stable use of steroids and 42 (34.7%) had change in steroid dose. The proportion of participants with change in steroid dose was 0% in the pooled placebo group, 14.3%-62.5% in the ritlecitinib treatment groups and 25.0%-47.8% in the brepocitinib treatment groups. Six (2.1%) participants (2 in the ritlecitinib groups and 4 in the brepocitinib groups) with no steroid use at baseline reported concomitant steroid uses during the chronic period. The median systemic steroid dose (equivalent to prednisone) during the chronic period was 12.5 mg/day and similar across different treatment groups. Figure S2.

Efficacy Results: Induction Period Analyses of efficacy endpoints through the initial 8-week induction period were based on the ITT population in 7 treatment groups. Primary Endpoint Result - Total Mayo Score at Week 8 All doses of both ritlecitinib (200 mg, 70 mg, and 20 mg) and brepocitinib (60 mg, 30 mg, and 10 mg) met the pre-specified success criteria (1-sided p-value<0.05) for the primary efficacy endpoint, total Mayo score, at the end of the induction period (Week 8). The total Mayo score (LS mean [SE]) at Week 8 was 7.88 (0.56) in the placebo group, 5.85 (0.40), 4.00 (0.40) and 3.27 (0.42) for the ritlecitinib 20 mg, 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups; and 6.08 (0.40), 5.60 (0.40) and 4.67 (0.40) for the brepocitinib 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups, respectively. The differences versus placebo (LS mean [90% CI]) were -2.03 (-3.17, -0.89), -3.88 (-5.01, -2.74) and -4.61 (-5.76, -3.46) for the tirlecitinib 20 mg, 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups; and -1.79 (-2.92, -0.67), -2.28 (-3.41, -1.14) and -3.21 (-4.34, -2.08) for the brepocitinib 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups, respectively (Table S3). (N=50) Secondary Endpoints Results - Proportion of Participants Achieving Remission at Week 8 The ritlecitinib 200 mg and 70 mg and brepocitinib 60 mg and 30 mg doses differentiated (1-sided p-value <0.05) from placebo for the remission rate. At Week 8, the placebo-adjusted remission rates were 9.8%, 28.6% and 34.0% in the ritlecitinib 20 mg, 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups (Figure S3), and 8.3%, 23.4% and 23.4% in the brepocitinib 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups (Figure S4), respectively, with the placebo rate being 0%. A monotonic dose-response pattern was observed for both ritlecitinib and brepocitinib. The stratum-adjusted remission rates (stratification included prior use of anti-TNF, anti-integrin, biologic therapies, 5-aminosalicylic acid [5-ASA] and steroids and concomitant use of steroid and 5-ASA) showed consistent results, which supported the robustness of the main analysis.

In general, the 4 Mayo subscores continued to decrease through Week 8 in all active treatment groups. At Week 8, all treatment groups showed statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline when compared with the placebo group (1-sided p-value<0.05). The placebo-adjusted LS means of change from baseline in total Mayo score were -2.03, -3.88 and -4.61 in the ritlecitinib 20 mg, 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups; and -1.79, -2.28 and -3.21 in the brepocitinib 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups, respectively. Both compounds had a rapid onset of action as evidenced by changes to stool frequency and rectal bleeding at Week 2 and continued to decline at Week 8. Secondary Endpoints Results - Change From Baseline Over Time in Partial Mayo Scores For the partial Mayo score, all ritlecitinib and brepocitinib dose groups demonstrated a statistically significant improvement starting at Week 2 (1-sided p-value<0.05). At Week 8, a numerically greater improvement in the partial Mayo score was observed for both compounds with dose dependent manner. The placebo-adjusted means (90% CI) of change from baseline in partial Mayo score were -1.39 (-2.25, -0.53), -2.91 (-3.77, -2.05) and -3.53 (-4.41, -2.66) in the ritlecitinib 20 mg, 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups; and -1.36 (-2.22, -0.49), -1.56 (-2.42, -0.69) and -2.32 (-3.19, -1.45) in the brepocitinib 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups, respectively (LS mean [90% CI] in the placebo group: -1.15 [-1.86, -0.45]). Secondary Endpoints Results - Proportion of Participants Achieving Improvement in Endoscopic Appearance at Week 8 For the improvement in endoscopic appearance at Week 8, ritlecitinib doses (20 mg, 70 mg, and 200 mg) and all brepocitinib doses (10 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg) differentiated from the placebo (1-sided p-value<0.05). The placebo-adjusted endoscopic improvement rates for ritlecitinib 20 mg, 70 mg, and 200 mg were 21.6%, 34.7% and 42.0%, respectively, with the placebo rate being 0% (Figure S3). Similar response rates were observed between brepocitinib higher doses (31.9% and 29.8% for the 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups, respectively) (Figure S4). Secondary Endpoints Results - Proportion of Participants Achieving Clinical Response at Week 8 For clinical response rate, a statistically significant (1-sided p-value <0.05) difference from placebo was seen with ritlecitinib 200 mg and 70 mg (Figure S3), and brepocitinib 60 mg and 30 mg (Figure S4) treatment groups during the induction period. All treatment groups differentiated from the placebo for modified clinical response at Week 8. Secondary Endpoints Results - Proportion of Participants Achieving Endoscopic Remission at Week 8 At Week 8, no participants in the placebo group achieved endoscopic remission. For ritlecitinib, the placebo-adjusted response rates at Week 8 were 3.9%, 8.2%, 12.0% in the 20 mg, 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups, respectively (Figure S3), which appeared to be dose-dependent. No statistically significant difference from placebo was observed in any ritlecitinib active treatment groups. For brepocitinib, the highest response rate at Week 8 was observed in the brepocitinib 30 mg treatment group (17.0%, 1-sided p-value: 0.0212) (Figure S4), which differentiated from the placebo. Secondary Endpoints Results - Proportion of Participants Achieving Symptomatic Remission at Week 8 At Week 8, no participants in the placebo group achieved symptomatic remission. The higher dose groups of ritlecitinib (70 mg and 200 mg) and brepocitinib (30 mg and 60 mg) differentiated from the placebo (1-sided p-value <0.05). The placebo-adjusted response rates were 16.3% and 26.0% for the 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups, respectively. The brepocitinib 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups showed similar response rates (14.9% both). Secondary Endpoints Results - Proportion of Participants Achieving Deep Remission at Week 8 At Week 8, no participants in the placebo group achieved deep remission. For ritlecitinib, the placebo-adjusted response rates at Week 8 were 3.9%, 8.2%, 12.0% in the 20 mg, 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference from the placebo was observed in any ritlecitinib treatment groups. For brepocitinib, the highest placebo-adjusted response rate at Week 8 was observed in the brepocitinib 30 mg treatment groups (14.9%, 1-sided p-value: 0.0288), which differentiated from the placebo. Secondary Endpoints Results - Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) at Weeks 4 and 8 Starting at Week 4, the ritlecitinib 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups and the brepocitinib 60 mg treatment group differentiated from placebo for the improvement in IBDQ total and in all domain scores (1-sided p-value <0.05). At Week 8, the ritlecitinib 70 mg and 200 mg and brepocitinib 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups showed significant improvement in IBDQ total score and all domain scores when compared to the placebo (1-sided p-value <0.05). At Week 8, the placebo-adjusted means of change from baseline in IBDQ total score were 34.97 and 37.93 in the ritlecitinib 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups; and were 24.58 and 32.16 in the brepocitinib 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups, respectively. Secondary Endpoints Results - Proportion of Participants With IBDQ Total Score ≥170 at Weeks 4 and 8 Starting at Week 4, the ritlecitinib 200 mg treatment group differentiated from placebo for the response rate of IBDQ total score ≥170 (response rate: 46.0%, 1-sided p-value: 0.0417). At Week 8, the ritlecitinib 70 mg and 200 mg and the brepocitinib 60 mg treatment groups differentiated from placebo for the response rate (1-sided p-value <0.05). For ritlecitinib, the numerically greatest response rate (placebo-adjusted) was observed in the 70 mg treatment group (37.1%) compared to the 20 mg (9.4%) and 200 mg (24.0%) treatment groups, while appearing to be dose-dependent across the brepocitinib treatment groups: 11.3%, 20.4% and 31.1% in the 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg treatment group, respectively. Secondary Endpoints Results - Proportion of Participants With Increase From Baseline in IBDQ Total Score ≥16 at Weeks 4 and 8 Starting at Week 4, ritlecitinib and brepocitinib higher dose groups (ritlecitinib 70 mg and 200 mg, brepocitinib 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups) differentiated from the placebo in the response rate of change from baseline in IBDQ total score ≥16 (1-sided p-value <0.05). The statistically significant differences from the placebo were maintained through Week 8 in ritlecitinib 70 mg, brepocitinib 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups. At Week 8, the placebo-adjusted response rates were 23.6% in the ritlecitinib 70 mg treatment group; 24.9% and 22.7% in the brepocitinib 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups, respectively. Secondary Endpoints Results - Proportion of Participants With Improvement in IBDQ Bowel Symptom Domain at Weeks 4 and 8 Starting at Week 4, all treatment groups (ritlecitinib and brepocitinib) differentiated from placebo for the response rate of improvement in IBDQ bowel symptom domain except for the brepocitinib 10 mg treatment group (1-sided p-value<0.05). Between Week 4 and Week 8, the response rate continued to improve in all brepocitinib treatment groups while being maintained in all ritlecitinib treatment groups. At Week 8, all treatment groups (ritlecitinib and brepocitinib) differentiated from placebo for the response rate of improvement in IBDQ bowel symptom domain (1-sided p-value<0.05). Secondary Endpoints Results - Change From Baseline in Short Form 36 Version 2 (SF-36 v2) Acute The baseline values (physical component score [PCS] and mental component score [MCS]) were generally similar across all treatment groups. For the PCS, a statistically significant difference from placebo was observed in the ritlecitinib 200 mg treatment group (placebo-adjusted LS mean of change from baseline [90% CI]: 4.52 [1.90, 7.13], 1-sided p-value: 0.0023) starting at Week 4. At Week 8, ritlecitinib 70 and 200 mg treatment groups and brepocitinib 60 mg treatment group differentiated from the placebo (1-sided p-value0.05). For the MCS, a rapid onset of action was not observed in any treatment groups at Week 4. Ritlecitinib 70 and 200 mg treatment groups and brepocitinib 60 mg treatment group differentiated from the placebo (1-sided p-value0.05) at Week 8. Secondary Endpoints Results - Change From Baseline in EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 3 Levels and Visual Analog Scale (EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D VAS) The descriptive summary of absolute value and change from baseline in EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D VAS showed generally similar mean baseline values across all treatment groups. At Week 8, a statistically significant improvement was observed for the ritlecitinib 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups and brepocitinib 60 mg treatment group (1-sided p-value0.05) in utility score but not in any of the domain scores. For EQ-5D VAS, a statistically significant improvement was observed for the ritlecitinib 200 mg treatment groups early at Week 4 (placebo-adjusted mean of change from baseline [90% CI]: 9.04 [1.32, 16.76], 1-sided p-value: 0.0272), and was maintained through Week 8 (9.38 [1.06, 17.69], 1-sided p-value: Exploratory or Other Endpoints Results - Proportion of Participants Achieving Modified Remission at Week 8 For the modified remission rate, all doses for ritlecitinib (200 mg, 70 mg, and 20 mg) and brepocitinib (60 mg, 30 mg, and 10 mg) differentiated from placebo (1-sided p-value<0.05).

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Results: Pharmacokinetic Results Induction Period PF-06651600/ritlecitinib: At Week 8, a dose dependent increase of plasma ritlecitinib concentration was observed across 20 mg to 200 mg QD doses with the maximum mean plasma concentration observed at 1-hour post-dose (123.5 ng/mL, 496.4 ng/mL and 1274 ng/mL for the 20 mg, 70 mg and 200 mg treatment groups, respectively) when serial PK samples were collected up to 4 hours post-dose. PF-06700841/brepocitinib: At Week 8, a dose dependent increase of plasma brepocitinib concentration was observed across 10 mg to 60 mg QD doses with the maximum mean plasma concentration observed at 2-hour post-dose (79.87 ng/mL, 270.5 ng/mL and 568.2 ng/mL for the 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups, respectively) when serial PK samples were collected up to 4 hours post-dose. Chronic Period Blood was collected prior to dosing and the concentration values were highly variable and generally less than the lower limit of quantification (1 ng/mL) which was not unexpected due to the short half-life (~1.3 to 2.3 hours) of the drug. The predose concentration values for brepocitinib during the chronic dosing period were of the same order of magnitude as values from participants who received 30 mg in both the induction and chronic periods. Pharmacodynamic Results Induction Period: At Week 4, the ritlecitinib 70 mg, 200 mg and brepocitinib 60 mg treatment groups showed statistically significant decreases in fecal calprotectin when compared to the placebo (1-sided p-value0.05), but were not maintained through Week 8. The numerically highest decrease in fecal calprotectin (µg/g) was observed for ritlecitinib in the 70 mg treatment group (placebo-adjusted LS mean of percent change from baseline: -9.72% [90% CI: -20.36%, 0.93%]) and for brepocitinib in the 60 mg treatment group (placebo-adjusted LS mean of percent change from baseline: -10.33% [90% CI: -21.17%, 0.50%]). Chronic Period: The fecal calprotectin concentration decreased through Week 16 and was maintained through Week 32 for all ritlecitinib treatment groups. The numerically greatest decrease in fecal calprotectin was observed in the 70 mg50 mg treatment group at Week 16 (LS mean of percent change from baseline: -27.81% [log2 transformed]). For brepocitinib, the fecal calprotectin concentration continued to decrease through Week 32 for all treatment groups. The numerically greatest decrease in baseline in fecal calprotectin was observed in the placebo30 mg treatment group at Week 32 (LS mean of percent change from baseline: -32.61% [log2 transformed]). Safety Results: AEs, SAEs and Other Significant AEs All AEs described in this synopsis were treatment-emergent unless otherwise specified. Induction Period: The 317 participants who received at least 1 dose of ritlecitinib, brepocitinib, or placebo during the induction period were analyzed in 7 treatment groups: A total of 146 (46.1%) participants reported 308 all-causality AEs during the induction period, 81 of the AEs were assessed by the investigator as study treatment-related. The majority of all-causality AEs were mild or moderate in severity. The percentages of participants with all-causality AEs in the ritlecitinib (43.3%) and brepocitinib (47.9%) groups were lower than in the placebo (52.0%) group. No dose-related increase in these events was observed in the ritlecitinib and the brepocitinib groups. Numerically more participants in the brepocitinib treatment groups (16.9%) experienced all-causality AEs under the system organ class (SOC) of Infections and Infestations when compared with the placebo (4.0%) and the ritlecitinib treatment groups (8.7%). A total of 10 (6.7%) participants in the ritlecitinib treatment groups compared to 4 (2.8%) participants in the brepocitinib treatment groups discontinued the study due to all-causality AEs. No study discontinuations due to all-causality AEs were reported in the placebo group. A total of 11 treatment-emergent all-causality SAE cases (14 events) were reported in 11 participants during the induction period with no dose relationship observed with either ritlecitinib or brepocitinib. There were numerically similar number of SAEs in the ritlecitinib (7 events/6 participants) and brepocitinib groups (7 events/5 participants). No SAEs were reported in the placebo group. The majority of SAEs were considered unrelated to the study treatment. Three all-causality SAE infections were reported in 2 participants during the induction period, both in the ritlecitinib groups (1 each in the 20 mg and 200 mg treatment groups), and none of these SAEs (infections) were assessed as related to the study treatment. One participant in the ritlecitinib 20 mg treatment group experienced an SAE of myocardial infarction which resulted in death. The event was assessed as unrelated to study treatment by the investigator. No pregnancies were reported during the induction period. During the induction period, there was 1 thromboembolic event reported as an SAE of peripheral artery thrombosis (with concurrent AE of thrombocytosis) in a participant in the brepocitinib 30 mg treatment group, and the SAE was considered unrelated to the study treatment.

Herpes zoster AEs were reported in 3 participants with 1 each in the brepocitinib 60 mg, ritlecitinib 70 mg and placebo group). Unexplained skin rashes AEs occurred in a balanced manner between ritlecitinib and brepocitinib treatment groups (5 participants in the ritlecitinib treatment groups, 4 in the brepocitinib treatment groups and 2 in the placebo group). No dose effects were observed in the ritlecitinib or brepocitinib groups during the induction period. Chronic Period: The participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment (ritlecitinib, brepocitinib, or placebo) and reported adverse events during the chronic period were analyzed in 9 treatment groups including 4 ritlecitinib treatment groups (placebo50 mg, 20 mg50 mg, 70 mg50 mg and 200 mg50 mg treatment groups), 4 brepocitinib treatment groups (placebo30 mg, 10 mg30 mg, 30 mg30 mg and 60 mg30 mg treatment groups) and 1 pooled placebo group. In total, 163 (58.2%) participants reported 390 all-causality AEs during the chronic period, 74 of the AEs were assessed by the investigator as study treatment-related. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. The percentages of participants with all-causality AEs were 48.6% in the pooled placebo group, 46.2%-80.0% in the ritlecitinib treatment groups, and 44.4%-66.7% in the brepocitinib treatment groups. Thirty-one participants in the brepocitinib treatment groups (11.1%-30.8% across treatment groups) experienced AEs under the SOC of Infections and Infestations compared to the ritlecitinib treatment groups (20 participants, 10.3%-22.2% across treatment groups) and the pooled placebo group (8 participants, 15.4%). Nineteen (6.8%) participants discontinued from the study due to all-causality AEs. The majority were in the pooled placebo groups (6 participants, 16.2%), followed by brepocitinib 30 mg30 mg treatment group (4 participants, 10.3%) and ritlecitinib 20 mg50 mg treatment group (3 participants, 7.7%). Thirteen treatment-emergent all-causality SAE cases (17 events) were reported in 13 participants during the chronic period. Numerically more SAEs were reported in the brepocitinib groups (11 events/8 participants) when compared with the ritlecitinib groups (6 events/5 participants). No SAEs were reported in the pooled placebo group. The majority of SAEs were considered unrelated to the study treatment. Two SAE infections were reported in 2 participants during the chronic period, both in the brepocitinib groups (1 each in the brepocitinib 10 mg30 mg and 60 mg30 mg treatment groups), and neither of these SAEs (infections) were assessed as related to brepocitinib. No deaths were reported. Two pregnancies were reported during the chronic period During the chronic period, no thromboembolic events were reported. Herpes simplex AEs were reported in 2 participants (1 each in the ritlecitinib and brepocitinib groups and none in the pooled placebo group). Herpes zoster AEs were reported in 4 participants with 3 in the ritlecitinib 70 mg50 mg treatment group, 1 in the brepocitinib 10 mg30 mg treatment group and none in the pooled placebo group. Unexplained skin rashes AEs occurred in a balanced manner between ritlecitinib and brepocitinib treatment groups (6 participants in the ritlecitinib treatment groups and 8 participants in the brepocitinib treatment groups). Clinical Laboratory Evaluations In general, there were no clinically significant findings for changes from baseline in any hematology parameter for any treatment group (either ritlecitinib or brepocitinib) during the study. The mean absolute values were all within normal range. A slight decrease in platelet levels was observed in the ritlecitinib groups through Week 8 (induction period) and from Week 8 to Week 12. Through Week 32 (chronic period), the significant changes from baseline in platelet levels were observed for the brepocitinib treatment groups. There appeared to be a dose-related small decrease in lymphocyte levels in the ritlecitinib groups through Week 8 (induction period), and these reductions were within the normal range. Through Week 32 (chronic period), the lymphocyte levels in all ritlecitinib groups were generally maintained with no further decline. No significant changes from baseline in neutrophil levels were observed for the brepocitinib treatment groups. An increase in creatine kinase (CK) level was observed in the brepocitinib 30 mg and 60 mg treatment groups through Week 8 (induction period). The mean absolute values were within the normal range and no dose-dependent trends were observed. During the chronic period, CK levels remained stable in all treatment groups with no further increases except for the brepocitinib 30 mg30 mg treatment group. A higher incidence of CK elevations (27.0%) was observed in the brepocitinib 30 mg30 mg treatment group during the chronic period (≤10.0% in other treatment groups). No events of rhabdomyolysis were reported during the induction/chronic periods. The mean absolute values of all fasting lipid parameters were within the normal range throughout the study. During the induction period, increases from baseline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were observed for all ritlecitinib and brepocitinib treatment groups, which appeared to be dose-dependent in brepocitinib treatment groups. During the chronic period, the HDL levels were maintained in all treatment groups with no further elevation. There were no participants with a concomitant decline of ≥30% compared to the baseline in both creatinine based and cystatin-C based eGFRs. Vital Signs, ECGs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety There were no clinically significant observations for vital signs, ECGs or physical findings throughout the study. No cases of malignancy were reported during the study. The proportions of participants with clinically significant abnormal hearing status in all treatment groups remained stable throughout the study: 14.3% (left and right ears) in the placebo group, 0.8% (left and right ears) in the ritlecitinib treatment groups; 1.6%/0.8% (left/right ear) in the brepocitinib treatment groups at Week 8; 3.2% (left and right ears) in the pooled placebo group, 0%-10.0% (left/right ear) in the ritlecitinib treatment groups and 0%-3.3% (left/right ear) in the brepocitinib treatment groups at Week 32. There were no participants with clinically significant abnormal hearing status that worsened from baseline and not improved through early termination/Week 32. During the induction period, AE related to hearing loss was reported in 1 participant in the brepocitinib 60 mg treatment group with no dose effects observed; During the chronic period, 5 participants experienced AEs related to hearing loss. All 5 participants were in the ritlecitinib group: 2 in placeboritlecitinib 50 mg treatment group and 1 each in the ritlecitinib 20 mg50 mg, 70 mg50 mg and 200 mg50 mg treatment groups. Conclusions: Ritlecitinib and brepocitinib are both efficacious in UC as demonstrated by the clinical effect observed during the induction period in the primary endpoint (total Mayo score) and multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints. At Week 8, all treatment groups (ritlecitinib and brepocitinib) differentiate from the placebo in the total Mayo score. The ritlecitinib 200 mg and 70 mg and brepocitinib 60 mg and 30 mg doses showed significant improvement in the response rates of remission, modified remission, clinical response, endoscopic improvement, symptomatic remission and partial Mayo score, histologic improvement, histologic remission and mucosal healing. A rapid onset of action as early as Week 2 was observed in the improvement of partial Mayo score for all ritlecitinib and brepocitinib dose groups. Clinical effects of ritlecitinib and brepocitinib were also observed at Week 8 in PROs. Ritlecitinib 70 and 200 mg treatment groups and brepocitinib 60 mg treatment group differentiated from the placebo in the IBDQ scores, SF-36 v2 MCS and PCS, EQ-5D-3L. The chronic dosing period of the study was not designed or powered to test the durability of efficacy. However, therapeutic benefit was generally present during chronic dosing. In general, the clinical improvement was greater in the participants treated with a higher dose in the chronic dosing period than in the induction period (ritlecitinib: placebo50 mg, 20 mg50 mg; brepocitinib: placebo30 mg, 10 mg30 mg), and were maintained or slightly decreased in the ritlecitinib 200 mg50 mg and 70 mg50 mg, and brepocitinib 60 mg30 mg and 30 mg30 mg treatment groups. However, the optimal maintenance doses for ritlecitinib and brepocitinib remain to be established. Ritlecitinib and brepocitinib also demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile based on the safety analyses of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation, SAEs, serious infection events, lab abnormalities during the study and AEs of interest (such as herpes zoster infections and hearing loss) reported in both the induction and chronic dosing periods of this study.
