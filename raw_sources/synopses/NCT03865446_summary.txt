METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1, open-label, parallel-group study to investigate the effect of severe hepatic impairment on the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability after a single oral dose of dacomitinib 30 mg under fasted conditions. At Screening, the modified Child-Pugh classification was utilized to assess entry criteria and to assign participants into the appropriate hepatic function group, ie, Group 1 or Group 2 (Table 2). The score assigned for observed findings in modified Child-Pugh classification of liver dysfunction is presented in Table 3. Participants with severe hepatic impairment (Class C) should have ≥10 points. Approximately 18 participants were planned to be enrolled into the study to ensure at least 6 PK evaluable (having data for estimating primary PK parameters for dacomitinib) participants in each group. The participants for the severe hepatic impairment group were recruited first, then the participants for the normal hepatic function group were recruited to match the median age and body weight from the severe hepatic impairment group. An attempt was made to maintain a similar male/female ratio and racial make-up between Participants were to be screened for participation within 28 days prior to the dosing of dacomitinib. Each participant was admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day -1. Participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned a randomization number on Day 1 and were administered a single dose of dacomitinib 30 mg on the morning of Day 1 following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. Each participant underwent serial blood sampling to determine plasma concentrations of dacomitinib and its metabolite PF-05199265. Separate aliquots of blood (10 mL) were collected for measurements of protein binding. Participants were confined to the CRU until Day 7. All participants were followed up by a phone call at least 28 days and up to 35 days after dacomitinib dosing. Table 2.

Investigator site personnel administered dacomitinib tablets with approximately 240 mL of ambient temperature water. Participants swallowed the tablets whole without manipulating or chewing the tablets prior to swallowing. Efficacy Evaluations: Not Applicable Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacogenomic Evaluations: Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Serial blood samples for plasma concentrations of dacomitinib and its metabolite PF-05199265 were collected pre-dose and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216 and 264 hours following dosing. Additional blood samples for protein binding analysis were collect at pre-dose and at 6 and 8 hours postdose. Plasma samples were analyzed for dacomitinib and PF-05199265 concentrations in plasma using a validated, sensitive and specific liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures (SOPs). Plasma protein binding samples for the extent of the protein binding of dacomitinib and its metabolite, PF-05199265, were dialyzed using a rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) method. The dialyzed phosphate buffered saline was analyzed for unbound concentrations of dacomitinib and PF-05199265 using a validated, sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method in compliance with Pfizer SOPs. The following PK parameters (Table 5) for dacomitinib and PF-05199265 were calculated for each participant using noncompartmental analysis of concentration-time data. Table 5.

Pharmacogenomic Evaluations: A blood sample was collected on Day -1 for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotyping. Samples were analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with Pfizer SOPs. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring, laboratory evaluations, physical examinations, vital signs (blood pressure [BP] and pulse rate), electrocardiogram (ECG). Statistical Methods: Pharmacokinetic: The PK concentration analysis set was defined as all participants who took 1 dose of dacomitinib and had at least 1 dacomitinib plasma concentration. The PK parameter analysis set was defined as all participants who took 1 dose of dacomitinib and had at least 1 dacomitinib plasma PK parameters of primary interest. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the natural log transformed (AUC ), area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to the time of the last inf quantifiable concentration (AUC ) and maximum plasma concentration (C ), and last max unbound AUC (AUC ), unbound AUC (AUC ) and unbound C (C ) of inf inf,u last last,u max max,u dacomitinib and PF-05199265, as data permitted, for the severe hepatic impairment group (Test) to the normal hepatic function group (Reference). Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (Test-Reference) and corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from the model. The adjusted mean differences and 90% CIs for the differences were exponentiated to provide estimates of the ratio of adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) and 90% CIs for the ratios as a percentage. Only participants with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer (EM) and intermediate metabolizer (IM) in each cohort were included in this analysis. Safety: The safety analysis set was defined as all participants assigned to dacomitinib and who took 1 dose of dacomitinib. Safety data were presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively by cohort, where appropriate. RESULTS Participants Disposition and Demography: A total of 16 participants meeting the eligibility criteria entered the study. Eight participants were in each hepatic function group (the severe hepatic impairment group and the normal hepatic function group). All 16 participants were treated with dacomitinib and all completed the study. All 16 participants were male. For participants in the severe hepatic impairment group, they were reported with a median age of 60.50 (range: 52 to 68) years, a mean weight of 91.5 (range: 69.3 to 122.3) kg, a mean BMI of 29.97 (range: 24.85 to 36.92) kg/m2 and most were White (7 of 8 participants, 87.5%). For participants in the normal hepatic function group, they were reported with a median age of 58.00 (range: 53 to 68) years, a mean weight of 91.8 (77.8 to 104.4) kg, a mean BMI of 28.57 (range: 25.53 to 32.58) kg/m2 and all were White (8 participants, 100%). The 2 hepatic function groups were similar in age composition, male/female ratio, racial make-up and mean baseline characteristics of the participants. Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done for this study. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacogenomic Results: Pharmacokinetic Results: Dacomitinib PK parameters for total and unbound drug are summarized descriptively in Table 6. Statistical summary of plasma dacomitinib PK parameters using an ANOVA model are presented in Table 7 (total drug) and Table 8 (unbound drug). PF-05199265 PK parameters for total and unbound metabolite are summarized descriptively in Table 9. Statistical summary of plasma PF-05199265 PK parameters using an ANOVA model are presented in Table 10 (total metabolite) and Table 11 (unbound metabolite). Total Dacomitinib PK: Following administration of a single oral dose of dacomitinib 30 mg in the fasted state to participants in the 2 hepatic function groups, the median time for C (T ) for dacomitinib max max was 7 hours postdose for the severe hepatic impairment group and 12 hours postdose for the normal hepatic function group. The ANOVA statistical comparison showed that geometric mean AUC values were similar inf while geometric mean C increased by approximately 31% in participants with severe max hepatic impairment compared to those with normal hepatic function (Table 7). Test/reference ratios (90% CI) of the adjusted geometric means, as a percentage, for dacomitinib AUC and C were 104.41% (72.12%, 151.16%), and 130.91% (86.03%, inf max 199.22%), respectively, for the severe hepatic impairment group (Test) compared to the normal hepatic function group (Reference). Mean terminal half-life (t ) values were slightly longer (75.6 hours) for the severe hepatic ½ impairment group than for the normal hepatic function group (63.9 hours), while no marked differences were observed in mean apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (V /F) and z mean apparent clearance after oral dose (CL/F) values between the 2 hepatic function groups (Table 6). The inter-participant variability as assessed by percent coefficient of variation (%CV) for the geometric mean of plasma dacomitinib AUC and C was 37% and 35% for the severe inf max hepatic impairment group, and 48% and 63% for the normal hepatic function group, respectively. Unbound Dacomitinib PK: Approximately 98% of dacomitinib is bound to plasma proteins. Mean fraction of unbound drug in plasma (Fu) values were 0.02853 for the severe hepatic impairment group and 0.02203 for the normal hepatic function group. This small decrease in plasma protein binding in the severe hepatic impairment group (Table 6) corresponded to an approximately 30% increase in Fu compared to participants with normal hepatic function. Dacomitinib unbound exposure based on geometric mean AUC and C values inf,u max,u increased by 32% and approximately 69%, respectively, for the severe hepatic impairment group compared to the normal hepatic function group. The test/reference ratios (90% CI) of the adjusted geometric means, as a percentage, for dacomitinib AUC and C were inf,u max,u 132.00% (88.48%, 196.91%) and 169.23% (108.50%, 263.95%), respectively, for the severe hepatic impairment group (Test) compared to the normal hepatic function group (Reference) (Table 8). The inter-participant variability as assessed by %CV for the geometric mean of plasma dacomitinib AUC and C was 41% and 33%, respectively, for the severe hepatic inf,u max,u Total Metabolite PK: Following administration of a single oral dose of dacomitinib 30 mg, the median T for max PF-05199265 was 10 hours postdose for the severe hepatic impairment group and 7 hours postdose for the normal hepatic function group. Total plasma PF-05199265 exposure decreased by approximately 19% for AUC and by inf approximately 66% for C , respectively, for the severe hepatic impairment group compared max to the normal hepatic function group. Test/reference ratios (90% CI) of the adjusted geometric means, as a percentage, for PF-05199265 AUC and C were 80.94% (41.30%, 158.63%) and 33.58% (15.26%, inf max 73.93%), respectively, for the severe hepatic impairment group (Test) compared to the normal hepatic function group (Reference). Mean t value was longer for the severe hepatic impairment group (114 hours) than that for ½ the normal hepatic function group (72.8 hours). The inter-participant variability, as assessed by %CV, for the geometric mean of plasma PF-05199265 AUC and C was 89% and 136% for the severe hepatic impairment group, inf max and 80% and 87% for the normal hepatic function group, respectively. Unbound Metabolite PK: A decrease in the PF-05199265 plasma protein binding was observed for the severe hepatic impairment group (Table 9), as evidenced by an approximately 4-fold increase in Fu compared to participants with normal hepatic function. Mean Fu values were 0.0007996 for the severe hepatic impairment and 0.0001845 for the normal hepatic function group. PF-05199265 unbound exposure based on AUC and C values increased by inf,u max,u approximately 186% and 32%, respectively, for the severe hepatic impairment group compared to the normal hepatic function group. The test/reference ratios (90% CI) of the adjusted geometric means, as a percentage, for PF-05199265 AUC and C were 285.85% (157.84%, 517.69%), and 132.20% inf,u max,u (68.43%, 255.38%), respectively, for the severe hepatic impairment group (Test) compared to the normal hepatic function group (Reference). The inter-participant variability, as assessed by %CV, for the geometric mean of plasma PF-05199265 AUC and C values was 77% and 100%, respectively, for the severe inf,u max,u hepatic impairment and 68% and 73%, respectively, for the normal hepatic function group.

Safety Results: No treatment-emergent AEs were reported for the study, ie, no AEs were reported to have occurred following start of treatment or increased in severity after treatment. The most frequently reported laboratory test abnormalities without regard to baseline abnormality were platelets, prothrombin time, total bilirubin, and urobilinogen with 5 (62.5%) participants each for the severe hepatic impairment group. The most frequently reported laboratory test abnormality without regard to baseline abnormality was partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with 3 (37.5%) participants for the normal hepatic function group. None of the laboratory test abnormalities were considered clinically significant by the investigator and therefore, none of these laboratory test abnormalities were reported as AEs. One (12.5%) participant in the severe hepatic impairment group had a 30 mm Hg increase in supine systolic BP from baseline on Day 7 meeting the categorical criterion of ≥30 mm Hg increase from baseline. One (12.5%) participant in the normal hepatic function group had a 28 mm Hg increase in supine diastolic BP from baseline on Day 7 meeting the categorical criterion of ≥20 mm Hg increase from baseline. None of the categorical vital sign values were considered clinically significant by the investigator and therefore none were reported as No participants in either hepatic function group had a QT interval calculated using Fridericia’s correction factor (QTcF) value ≥500 msec or a ≥60 msec increase from baseline in QTcF. No participants in either hepatic function group met categorical summarization criteria in other ECG results, ie, PR interval, QRS complex or QT interval. Conclusion(s):  Following administration of a single dose of dacomitinib 30 mg, participants with severe hepatic impairment had similar AUC values and an approximately 31% increase in C inf max when compared to participants with normal hepatic function.  A single oral dose of dacomitinib 30 mg was well tolerated in participants with severe hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function; no new safety issues were identified.
