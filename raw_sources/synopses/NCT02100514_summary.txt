Study Design: This study was a 52-week treatment, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, stratified, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial designed to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of bococizumab to placebo for LDL-C lowering in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia at high or very high risk for cardiovascular events. The study planned to randomize approximately 690 subjects in a 2:1 ratio (approximately 460 and 230 subjects in the bococizumab arm and placebo arm respectively), who were to receive study drug for 12 months. The primary comparison of interest was bococizumab 150 mg with placebo at Week 12. After providing consent, subjects entered a screening period of approximately 28 days to verify eligibility for the trial. Eligible subjects were considered enrolled and progressed to the randomization visit. Results from screening evaluations were reviewed and only subjects who continued to meet all eligibility criteria were to be randomized. Subjects were stratified by their pre-randomization TG level (<200 mg/dL [2.26 mmol/L] or 200 mg/dL [2.26 mmol/L]) and geographic region, and then randomized within each stratum to receive either bococizumab or placebo as described in Figure 1. Randomized subjects then entered the 52-week treatment period, followed by a 6-week follow-up, for a total of 58 weeks (approximately 14 months) of study participation. Subjects attended clinic visits as shown in the schedule of activities (Table 1). Figure 1.

The study planned to randomize approximately 690 subjects in a 2:1 ratio (approximately 460 and 230 subjects in the bococizumab arm and placebo arm respectively). There were 2122 subjects screened for this study, 746 subjects were assigned to study drug (full analysis set [FAS]) and received at least 1 dose of study drug (safety analysis set); 499 subjects received bococizumab 150 mg Q2W and 247 subjects received placebo. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Male and female subjects 18 years of age where permitted by law, with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia and who were to be at high or very high risk of incurring a cardiovascular event were eligible for inclusion in this study. For all clinical sites except for those in the Netherlands and in Singapore: subjects were required to be on a stable dose of either simvastatin 40 mg or higher, rosuvastatin 10 mg or higher, atorvastatin 20 mg or higher, or pravastatin 40 mg or higher for 6 weeks prior to screening. For clinical sites in the Netherlands only: subjects were required to be on a maximally tolerated stable dose of either simvastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, or pravastatin for 6 weeks prior to screening. The maximally tolerated dose was either the higher dose the subject could tolerate or the highest dose the investigator determined could be safely prescribed. For clinical sites in Singapore only: subjects were required to be on a statin medication regimen consistent with current international guidelines for the treatment of cholesterol (ie, on a maximally tolerated stable dose of simvastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, or pravastatin for 6 weeks prior to screening). No dose should have been lower than simvastatin 40 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 40 mg. On a background treatment with a statin, subjects had to have fasting LDL-C 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) at 2 screening visits (Screening Visit 1 [S1] and Screening Visit 3 [S3]) and the value at the third screening visit (S3) within 7 days (±3 days) of randomization was not to be lower or higher than 20% of this initial value (in order to control the variability related to the fasting LDL-C assay). All subjects who had fasting TG ≤400 mg/dL (4.51 mmol/L) at S3 were included. Main exclusions from the study included subjects with: History of a cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event or procedure during the past 90 days, history of congestive heart failure (CHF), New York Heart Association functional Class IV, or left ventricular ejection fraction measured by imaging <25%, poorly controlled hypertension at any screening visit or at randomization, and subjects who were unable to receive injections, as either a self-injection, or administered by a family member, or home caregiver. Pregnant females; breastfeeding females; males and females of childbearing potential who were unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception for the duration of the study and for 63 days after last dose of investigational product were also excluded from the study. Study Treatment: Subjects were randomized into 1 of 2 parallel groups in a 2:1 ratio:  Bococizumab 150 mg SC Q2W; Days (-1/+4 window range) 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141, 155, 169, 183, 197, 211, 225, 239, 253, 267, 281, 295, 309, 323, 337, and 351. The dose of 150 mg Q2W could be modified to 75 mg Q2W for subjects with 2 consecutive LDL-C concentrations 10 mg/dL (0.26 mmol/L) at the end of the dosing interval. Additionally, subjects with 2 consecutive LDL-C concentrations 10 mg/dL (0.26 mmol/L), even after a dose reduction, could have had their dose frequency modified to 75 mg every 4 weeks. Subjects were trained in self-administration of injections during screening Visits 2 and 3 and on Day 1. Subjects, who were not capable of self-administering of study drug, had the injections administered by a home caregiver or family member who was trained in the procedure during the screening period. Efficacy Endpoints: The primary endpoint was:  Percent change from baseline (CFB) in fasting LDL-C at Week 12. Key secondary endpoints were:  Percent CFB in fasting TC, ApoB, and non-HDL-C at Week 12;  Percent CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 12 in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia (pre-randomization TG <200 mg/dL [2.26 mmol/L]);  Percent CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 12 in subjects with mixed dyslipidemia (pre-randomization TG 200 mg/dL [2.26 mmol/L]);  Percent CFB in fasting Lp(a) at Week 12;  Percent CFB in fasting HDL-C at Week 12. Non-HDL-C was calculated as the difference between TC and HDL-C, both collected on the same day: Non-HDL-C = TC – HDL-C. Other secondary efficacy endpoints were:  Percent CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 24 and Week 52;  Percent CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 24 and Week 52 by TG cut-off of lesser or 200 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L);  Percent CFB in fasting TC, non-HDL-C, ApoB, Lp(a), and HDL-C at Week 24 and Week 52; Week 52;  Absolute CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 12 by TG cut off of lesser or 200 mg/dL (2.26 mmol/L);  Absolute CFB in fasting LDL-C, TC, non-HDL-C, ApoB, Lp(a), and HDL-C at Week 12;  Absolute CFB in fasting TC/HDL-C ratio and ApoB/ApoA-I ratio at Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52;  Percentage of subjects achieving fasting LDL-C 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) at Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52;  Percentage of subjects achieving fasting LDL-C 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52;  Plasma bococizumab concentrations at Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Blood samples were collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K EDTA) for the analysis of total bococizumab plasma 2 concentrations as specified in the schedule of activities (Table 1). On all bococizumab blood sample collection days, samples were collected prior to bococizumab dosing. Safety Evaluations: Safety was assessed by physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory results, and the reporting of adverse events (AEs) in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. In addition, blood samples were collected for assessment of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Safety endpoints included incidence of AEs (including injection site reactions) and incidence of ADAs and nAbs. Statistical Methods: The FAS included all subjects who were randomized and was the primary analysis set for the analysis of efficacy data in this study. The safety analysis set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects were analyzed according to their randomized treatment group regardless of any dose adjustments or adherence to study drug. The experiment-wise Type I error of  = 0.05 (2-sided) for the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints was controlled by using gatekeeping and Hochberg procedures. Key secondary endpoints were formally tested only if the null hypothesis for the primary analysis was rejected. The Hochberg procedure was applied to the key secondary endpoints and a 2-sided  = 0.05 level; no further corrections were made for multiple endpoints. A diagram of the decision rules is presented in Figure 2. A gatekeeping procedure was used to move between the steps, and the Hochberg procedure was applied within Steps 2 and 3, assuming the corresponding previous step was successful. Figure 2. Decision Rules for the Efficacy Analysis Step 1: Test the primary endpoint (percent CFB in LDL-C at Week 12) at α=0.05 Proceed only if null hypothesis is rejected Step 2: Test the 3 key secondary endpoints in Group 1 (percent CFB to Week 12 in TC, ApoB, and non-HDL-C) at α=0.05 using the Hochberg approach Proceed only if all 3 null hypotheses are rejected Step 3: Test the 2 key secondary endpoints in Group 2 (percent CFB in LDL-C at Week 12 in subjects with pre-randomization TG <200 mg/dL and in subjects with pre-randomization TG 200 mg/dL) at α=0.05 using the Hochberg approach Proceed only if both null hypotheses are rejected Step 4: Test the 2nd to the last key secondary endpoint (percent CFB in Lp[a] at Week 12) at α=0.05 Proceed only if null hypothesis is rejected Step 5: Test the last key secondary endpoint (percent CFB in HDL-C at Week 12) at α=0.05 ApoB = apolipoprotein B, CFB = change from baseline, HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Lp(a) = lipoprotein (a), TC = total cholesterol, TG = Triglycerides. The 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mean differences were not adjusted for multiplicity and were to be used for descriptive purposes only. Inferential testing of the secondary endpoints (not designated as key secondary) and of the exploratory endpoints was performed at  = 0.05 (2-sided) with no adjustment for multiplicity. Analysis of Primary Endpoint: For the primary analysis for the endpoint of percent CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 12, the primary analysis was a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. The MMRM model included fixed effects terms for treatment group (as a categorical variable), scheduled visit time point (as a categorical variable), interaction between treatment and scheduled visit time point, and interaction between baseline value and scheduled visit time point. Additionally, the covariates included in the model were geographic region, TG subgroup at were included in the primary analyses regardless of treatment compliance. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation method was used and an unstructured variance-covariance matrix was assumed for the within-subject errors (except for the MMRM analysis of percent CFB in Lp[a] [mg/dL] through Week 52, excluding off-drug-in-study (ODIS) data, where spatial power was used due to convergence issues). The Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom were also used, and the observed margins option was implemented in assigning categorical weights when calculating the adjusted means. The descriptive summary statistics for observed LDL-C, CFB, and percent CFB in LDL-C were presented by treatment group and visit. Continuous endpoints were summarized using the following statistics: Number of subjects, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), and minimum and maximum values. Sensitivity analyses using ODIS data and the center-at-baseline approach were performed to assess the robustness of the model to missing data. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints: The key secondary endpoints were analyzed in a similar manner as the primary endpoint, where an MMRM model was used. However, when examining the CFB in fasting LDL-C at Week 12 in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia (TG <200 mg/dL [2.26 mmol/L]) or in subjects with mixed dyslipidemia (pre-randomization TG 200 mg/dL [2.26 mmol/L]) the TG stratification variable was not included in the model, as those 2 key secondary endpoints formed a subgroup. For each endpoint, its baseline value was used in the MMRM model as a continuous covariate. The covariates included in the model were geographical region, TG subgroup at pre-randomization, and respective baseline value of the endpoint. Interactions for treatment by scheduled visit time point and for baseline value by scheduled visit time point were also included. Similar to the primary endpoint, data up to and including Week 12 were used in the model regardless of whether the subject remained on treatment or had discontinued treatment and remained in the study. For Lp(a), the data were also log-transformed for analysis as a supplemental analysis. Descriptive and graphical summaries by treatment group and time point were also presented. For the other secondary endpoints, CFB and percent CFB were analyzed in a similar manner as the primary endpoint, where an MMRM model was used. As with the key secondary endpoint analysis, the covariates included in the model were geographical region, TG subgroup at pre-randomization, and respective baseline value of the endpoint; the secondary endpoints using pre-randomization TG (<200 mg/dL, 200 mg/dL) did not use a term for pre-randomization TG in the analysis model. Sensitivity analyses using the center-at-baseline approach were performed for select secondary endpoints, to assess the robustness of the model to missing data. The percentage of subjects having LDL-C at or below certain levels (100 mg/dL, 70 mg/dL) was analyzed with a logistic regression model. Terms in the model included treatment baseline LDL-C (continuous). Summary measures from the analysis included the odds ratio, 95% CI for the odds ratio, and 2-sided p-value for each treatment comparison. Analysis of Pharmacokinetic parameters: Plasma bococizumab concentration at Week 12, Week 24, and Week 52 were summarized and reported. Analysis of Safety Parameters: AEs were summarized separately for those events with onset during the screening period and for those events with onset during the treatment or follow-up periods. All AEs were summarized by treatment group. AEs leading to discontinuation from study drug, AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) were tabulated. Summaries were also provided by severity and relationship to study drug. Deaths were listed individually. In addition, listings of adjudicated events for death, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), revascularization, hospitalization due to CHF, and cerebrovascular events were provided in accordance with the Cardiovascular Events Adjudication Committee (CEAC) charter. Additionally, a 3-tier approach was used to summarize AEs. Tier-1 AEs were AEs of special clinical interest including hypersensitivity reactions and severe injection site reactions, and were specified in the Safety Review Plan. For these events, the percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), the risk difference versus placebo, the associated 95% CI, and p-value were provided. The CIs and p-values were not adjusted for multiplicity and were provided for screening purposes only. Tier-2 AEs were those that were common, occurring in 1% of subjects in any treatment group. For these events, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs, the risk difference versus placebo and the associated 95% CI were provided. The CIs were for estimation purposes only. All AEs were Tier-3 events and were summarized as above. AEs were also summarized for the following subgroups: Age, gender, subjects with any post-baseline LDL-C 25 mg/dL, subjects with any dosing adjustment (yes, no), ADA status (positive, negative), and nAb status (positive, negative, inconclusive). Injection site reaction AEs were summarized by treatment group. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) higher level term of “Injection site reactions” was used to create a composite. A separate summary tabulated the number of subjects experiencing any injection site reaction AE, along with the incidence and severity for each preferred term (PT), by treatment group. The MedDRA higher level term of “Injection site reactions” was used to identify the AEs. Data collected on the Subcutaneous Injection Site Assessment case report form (CRF) were listed. Injection site reaction AEs were also summarized according to ADA status and nAb status. Mean observed and mean CFB in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, weight and waist circumference was tabulated by visit according to sponsor standards. sponsor standards. Height and temperature were listed. Mean observed and mean CFB in hematology, blood chemistry, and quantitative urinalysis parameters were tabulated by visit according to sponsor standards. Observations of potential clinical concern for hematology, blood chemistry and all urinalysis parameters were tabulated by treatment group according to sponsor standards. In addition, the proportion of subjects with ADAs was tabulated by treatment group. 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were locally read and the interpretations were kept at the investigation sites as source documents. Any clinically significant ECG abnormalities were reported as AEs. Physical examination findings were listed. Neurological exam findings were summarized according to sponsor standards. Immunogenicity Analysis: Number and percentage of subjects with positive ADAs and nAbs were summarized at the subject level at any time during the study (regardless of safety window visit). RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition (all randomized subjects) is summarized in Table 2. Of the 2122 subjects screened for study participation, 746 subjects were assigned to study drug (FAS) and received at least 1 dose of study drug (safety analysis set); 499 subjects received bococizumab 150 mg Q2W and 247 subjects received placebo. Of the 746 subjects randomized, 120 (16.1%) subjects discontinued study drug and 103 (13.8%) subjects discontinued the study. Table 2.

Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The analyses of percent CFB for the other secondary endpoints at Weeks 24 and 52 are presented in Table 6. The effects of bococizumab on lowering of LDL-C (overall and in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia), TC, non-HDL-C, and ApoB continued over the 24-week and 52-week treatment periods; however, these values were somewhat attenuated compared to Week 12. The effect of bococizumab on the increase of HDL-C continued at Week 24 and Week 52. The effects of bococizumab on lowering of Lp(a) also continued at Week 24 and Week 52; but was decreased at Week 24 and increased at Week 52 in comparison to Week 12.

CONCLUSIONS:  This Phase 3 study demonstrated a superior LDL-C lowering effect of bococizumab 150 mg administered SC Q2W compared with placebo at Week 12, with an adjusted mean treatment group difference of -49.9% (95% CI: −54.0, −45.8) at Week 12 (p <0.001).  A superior effect for bococizumab compared with placebo was also demonstrated at Week 12 for all key secondary endpoints (percent CFB in fasting TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, LDL-C in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia, LDL-C in subjects with mixed dyslipidemia, Lp[a], and HDL-C) for which Type I error was controlled. (LDL-C, TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, LDL-C in subjects with primary hyperlipidemia, and LDL-C in subjects with mixed dyslipidemia) above were slightly attenuated over time (through Week 52).  Bococizumab treatment resulted in greater reductions in TG, VLDL-C, TC/HDL-C and ApoB/ApoA-I ratios, and greater elevations in ApoA-I compared with placebo.  Subjects randomized to bococizumab were also more likely to achieve LDL-C values that were 100 and 70 mg/dL compared with placebo.  In subjects treated with bococizumab, trough plasma concentrations of 5.37 ± 5.327, 5.28 ± 5.888, and 4.01 ± 4.652 g/mL were achieved at Weeks 12, 24, and 52, respectively.  Bococizumab treatment was generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported non-serious AE in the bococizumab group was coded to the PT of Injection site reaction (13.4% bococizumab and 0.8 % placebo group).  The incidence of SAEs was lower in the bococizumab group compared with the placebo group (8.8% and 13.0%, respectively). Four (4) deaths occurred during the study, 2 (0.4%) in the bococizumab group and 2 (0.8%) in the placebo group. None of the deaths were considered by the investigator to be due to study drug.  The overall rate of discontinuations from the study was slightly higher in the bococizumab group compared with the placebo group (14.8% in bococizumab group; 11.7% in placebo group).  The overall incidence of ADAs and nAbs in bococizumab-treated subjects was 54.8% and 37.9%, respectively.
