METHODS Study Design: This was a 2-part, Phase 1, open label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic study of PF-04518600 (Part A) and PF-04518600 plus utomilumab combination therapy (Part B). Both Part A and Part B were further divided into a dose escalation phase (Parts A1, B1), and a dose expansion phase (Parts A2, B2). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Inclusion Criteria: Part A Monotherapy:  Part A1 only: Patients with histological or cytological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, or clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who progressed on or were intolerant to standard therapy, for which no standard therapy was available or who declined standard therapy.  Part A2 only: Patients with histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced/metastatic HCC who were treatment naive and had declined standard of care, or had at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy. Prior anti-PD-L1/PD-1 therapy was allowed.  Patients were required to have at least 1 measurable lesion as defined by RECIST v 1.1, be willing to undergo the mandatory biopsies and there was no excessive risk from biopsy as judged by the investigator. Part B Combination Therapy:  Part B1 only: Patients with histological or cytological diagnosis of NSCLC, SCCHN, melanoma, urothelial bladder carcinoma (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra), gastric or squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix who progressed on or were intolerant to standard therapy, for which no standard therapy was available, or who declined standard therapy.  Part B2 Arm 1 only:  Ocular melanoma patients with advanced/metastatic disease; or  Cutaneous/acral melanoma patients with advanced/metastatic disease who received checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1, or anti-CTLA4) based treatment on which disease progressed.  Part B2 Arm 2 only: Histological or cytological diagnosis of NSCLC with advanced/metastatic disease. Patients were required to have previously received prior anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 mAb on which disease progressed.  Patients were required to have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST v 1.1, be willing to undergo the mandatory biopsies and there was no excessive risk from a biopsy as judged by the investigator. Study Treatment: PF-04518600 was administered intravenously with adjustment for body weight or using a flat dose in Part A and Part B. Utomilumab was administered intravenously using a flat dose in Part B. Efficacy Evaluations: Tumor assessments included all known or suspected disease sites. Anti-tumor activity was assessed by investigators conducted at prespecified time points and whenever disease progression was suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), until confirmed progressive disease or start of subsequent anticancer therapy whichever occurred first. Assessment of tumor response was made using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) response criteria. Pharmacokinetic, Biomarker Evaluations and Immunogenicity Evaluations: Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: For Part A and Part B, blood samples for the analysis of PF-0451860 concentrations were collected into appropriately labeled tubes. For each analysis, 5 mL of blood samples were collected to provide approximately 2 mL serum. For Part B only, blood samples (2 mL whole blood at each time pint) were collected to provide serum for PK analysis of utomilumab. PK samples were assayed for PF-04518600 (both Part A and Part B) and utomilumab (Part B only) using validated analytical methods in compliance with Pfizer standard operation procedures. Immunogenicity Evaluations: Bioanalysis to assess for anti-drug (PF-04518600 or utomilumab) antibodies was performed. All samples that were positive in a screening assay were further characterized in terms of antibody specificity. A tiered approach to screening, confirmation and titer/quantitation was utilized. The screening assay with competitive confirmatory steps followed by the titer assay was used. Blood samples (10 mL) to provide approximately 5 mL of serum for ADA and NAb analysis were collected at pre-specified times. Samples were analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures. Biomarker and Pharmacodynamic Evaluations: Serum Pharmacodynamic Markers: Blood samples (3 mL) to provide approximately 1 mL serum for analysis of soluble OX40 were collected in Part A. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included pregnancy testing, AEs, safety laboratory assessments, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan. Statistical Methods: Efficacy Analyses Summaries of number and percentage of patients and data listings were generated for the PFS. Kaplan Meier method was used as data permitted. Summary statistics and data listings were prepared for the duration of stable disease, DoR, and OS. Pharmacokinetic Analyses The PK parameters were summarized and listed for patients in the PK analysis set. Each PK parameter was summarized by dose and cycle and included the set of summary statistics. Immunogenicity Analyses Summary counts of the patients for immunogenicity responses were derived. Biomarker Analyses Biomarkers were summarized by dose cohorts and tumor types. Safety Analyses Safety data were summarized by cohort, defined by the initial dose. The analysis was to summarize the AE incidence implementing Pfizer standard summaries. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts was used to estimate the MTD. AEs constituting DLTs were listed per dose level. Descriptive statistics were reported, and corresponding listings of data were generated. AEs were graded by the investigator according to the CTCAE v 4.03 and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and percentage of patients who experienced any AE, SAE, treatment-related AE, and treatment-related SAE was summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities were summarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each laboratory test. RESULTS The terms “patients” and “subjects” are used interchangeably Patient Disposition, Demographic, and Other Characteristics: In Part A monotherapy, 87 patients were treated at dose levels of PF-04518600 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.5, 3.0, 10 mg/kg, and 30 and 250 mg flat dose. Patients were deemed to have completed the study if they had on-study or long-term follow-up (LTFU) visits through 2 years from the first dose and as discontinued from study if they stopped having the LTFU visits prior to the 2-year anniversary. Fourteen patients have completed the study, and 73 patients have been discontinued from the study (Table S2). There were more male patients than female (75 versus 12), the mean age of all patients was 61.4 years, with a range of 23 to 81 years, the majority of patients (63.2%) were White, followed by Asian. Part A1 included patients with HCC (19 patients), melanoma (15 patients), SCCHN (9 patients), and RCC (9 patients), and Part A2 included patients with HCC only (35 patients). Most (96.6%) patients had prior systemic therapies with mean (range) lines of treatment of 3 (1-13). In Part B combination therapy, 87 patients were treated at dose levels of PF-04518600 + utomilumab 0.1 mg/kg + 20 mg, 0.3 mg/kg + 20 mg, 0.3 mg/kg + 100 mg, 1.0 mg/kg + 100 mg, 3.0 mg/kg + 100 mg and 30 mg + 20 mg. One of the patients completed the treatment, and 2 of the patients completed the study (Table S3). There were more male patients than female (50 versus 37), the mean age of all patients was 61.2 years, with a range of 22 to 85 years, the majority of patients (71.3%) were White, followed by Asian. Part B1 included patients with melanoma (18 patients), SCCHN (12 patients), gastric cancer (9 patients), bladder cancer (7 patients), NSCLC (6 patients), and cervical carcinoma (5 patients), and Part B2 included patients with NSCLC (20 patients) and melanoma (10 patients).

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Source Data: Table 16.2.1.1.2 Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 27DEC2020 Date of Table Generation: 29APR2021 (07:22) Efficacy Results: Objective Response For all patients in Part A, 3 confirmed PRs were reported out of 87 patients who had at least 1 post-treatment tumor assessment, the disease control rate was 55.2% (Table S4). The PF-04518600 0.3 mg/kg cohort had the highest disease control rate (63.6%) as assessed by CR + PR + stable disease. A PR was reported at dose levels 0.1 mg/ kg (melanoma), 0.3 mg/kg (HCC) and 10 mg/kg (melanoma). For all patients in Part B, 3 confirmed PRs were reported out of 87 patients who had at least 1 post-treatment tumor assessment, the disease control rate was 40.2% (Table S5). The PF-04518600 0.3 mg/kg + utomilumab 20 mg and PF-04518600 30 mg + utomilumab 20 mg cohorts had the highest disease control rates (both 50%) as assessed by CR + PR + stable disease. A PR was reported at dose levels of PF-04518600 0.3 mg/kg + utomilumab 20 mg (melanoma), PF-04518600 0.3 mg/kg + utomilumab 100 mg (melanoma) and PF-04518600 30 mg + utomilumab 20 mg (NSCLC). Duration of Response In Part A, for the 1 patient (melanoma) who achieved an objective response in the PF-04518600 0.1 mg/kg cohort, the DoR was 2.4 months, for the 1 patient (HCC) who achieved an objective response in the PF-04518600 0.3 mg/kg cohort, the duration of response was 21.4 months. The 1 patient (melanoma) who an achieved objective response in the PF-04518600 10 mg/kg cohort was censored at 8.25 months due to an unacceptable gap (12 weeks) between progressive disease to the most recent prior adequate assessment. In Part B, for the 1 patient (melanoma) who achieved an objective response in the PF-04518600 0.3 mg/kg + utomilumab 100 mg cohort, the DoR was 2.8 months followed by disease progression. The 1 patient (melanoma) who achieved an objective response in the PF-04518600 0.3 mg/kg + utomilumab 20 mg cohort was censored at 44.38 moths (reason: in follow-up for progression) and the 1 patient (NSCLC) who achieved an objective response in the PF-04518600 30 mg + utomilumab 20 mg was censored at 22.37 months (reason: withdrew consent for follow-up). Progression-Free Survival Among the 87 patients in Part A, a total of 70 (80.5%) patients had an event (64 objective progression and 6 deaths) for the analysis of PFS. The overall estimated median PFS was 2.9 months with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.9, 3.6). Patients in the PF-04518600 0.3 mg/kg cohort had the longest Kaplan-Meier estimate of median PFS (5.4 months [95% CI: 1.3, 24.0]). In this cohort, 7 (63.6%) patients had subsequent PFSs event (objective progression). There were 4 patients that were censored (1 patient withdrew consent for follow-up and 3 patients had an unacceptable gap [12 weeks] between progressive disease Among the 87 patients in Part B, a total of 75 (86.2%) patients had an event (70 objective progression and 5 deaths) for the analysis of PFS. The overall estimated median PFS was 1.7 months with a 95% CI (1.4, 2.7). Patients in the PF-04518600 30 mg + utomilumab 20 mg cohort had the longest Kaplan-Meier estimate of median PFS (3.2 months [95% CI: 1.7, 3.7]). In this cohort, 26 (86.7%) patients had subsequent PFS events (24 with objective progression and 2 with death without objective progression). There were 4 patients that were censored (1 patient had no on-study disease assessment, 1 patient was given new anti-cancer treatment [ipilimumab] prior to tumor progression, 1 patient withdrew consent for follow-up and 1 patient had an unacceptable gap between progressive disease or death to the most recent prior adequate assessment). Time to Progression For Part A, the median time to progression ranged from 1.3 to 8.3 months for patients across all dose levels. Patients in the PF-04518600 0.3 mg/kg cohort had the longest median time to progression (8.3 months [95% CI: 1.3, -]). For Part B, the median time to progression ranged from 1.4 to 3.3 months for patients across all dose levels. Patients in the PF-04518600 30 mg + PF-05082566 20 mg cohort had the longest median time to progression (3.3 months [95% CI: 1.7, 4.3]). Overall Survival For Part A, across all cohorts, 57 (65.5%) patients died (44 deaths for disease under study, 13 deaths for unknown or other reasons). All deaths due to unknown reasons occurred during the long-term survival follow-up period and 28 days of the last dose of study treatment. Thirty (34.5%) patients survived at the time of last patient last visit (LPLV), hence were censored for this analysis. The overall Kaplan-Meier estimated median survival time was 11.4 months with 95% CI (7.4, 16.2). The survival probabilities for all patients at Month 6, Month 12 and Month 24 were 74.1% (95% CI: 63.0%, 82.3%), 49.4% (95% CI: 37.6%, 60.0%) and 24.2% (95% CI: 14.8%, 34.7%), respectively. For Part B, across all cohorts, 65 (74.7%) patients died (44 deaths in the disease under study, 2 deaths from study treatment toxicity [both attributed to disease progression], and 19 deaths for unknown or other reasons). Twenty-two (25.3%) patients survived at the time of LPLV, hence were censored for this analysis. The overall Kaplan-Meier estimated median survival time was 9.6 months, with 95% CI (5.4, 12.0). The survival probabilities for all patients at Month 6, Month 12 and Month 24 were 61.4% (95% CI: 49.6%, 71.3%), 41.0% (95% CI: 29.6%, 52.1%) and 11.3% (95% CI: 4.8%, 20.9%), respectively.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Source Data: Table 16.2.6.4.1.2 Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 04JAN2021 Date of Table Generation: 04FEB2021 (09:21) Pharmacokinetic, Immunogenicity and Biomarker Results: Pharmacokinetic Results PF-04518600 PK Parameters Part A: Following single (Cycle 1 Day 1 [C1D1]) and multiple (Cycle 3 Day 3 [C3D1]) escalating IV dosing of PF-04518600 alone administered Q2W at dose levels of 0.01 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and as 30 mg and 250 mg doses, C was generally observed at or shortly after the end of the 1 hour infusion (median T = max max 1 to 4 hours) for both C1D1 and C3D1. Serum concentrations appeared to decline slowly over time. It should be noted that t could not be reported for a majority of profiles due to the ½ lack of a well-characterized terminal phase defined as one with at least 3 data points, an r2 ≥0.9, and AUC ≤20%. extrap% Overall, PF-04518600 systemic exposure based on geometric mean AUC values appeared tau to increase in a dose proportional manner across the 0.3 mg/kg – 10 mg/kg dose range following single and multiple dosing every 2 weeks. Lower exposure was observed for the 0.1 mg/kg dose which exhibited a pattern consistent with target-mediated drug disposition compared with the higher doses. Only 1 patient had evaluable data for the 0.01 mg/kg treatment on C1D1. Peak exposure based on geometric mean C values appeared to max increase in a dose proportional manner across the 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg dose range for both C1D1 and C3D1 data. R based on AUC ranged between 0.989 to 2.16 for the 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg dose range ac tau following multiple dosing. Geometric mean CL for C3D1 ranged between 0.1171 mL/hr/kg to 0.3342 mL/hr/kg. Variability in exposure based on geometric CV% ranged between 17%-151% (AUC and tau AUC ), and 17-54% (C and C ) following single and multiple dose administration tau(dn) max max(dn) for C1D1 and C3D1. Part B: Following escalating IV doses of PF-04518600 (0.1 mg/kg-3.0 mg/kg) administered once every 2 weeks (Q2W) in combination with 20 mg or 100 mg of utomilumab administered once every 4 weeks (Q4W), C values were generally observed at or shortly max after the end of the 1 hour infusion with a median T of 1 hour to 4 hours for C1D1 and max approximately 1 hour for C3D1. It should be noted that t could not be reported for majority of profile due to the lack of ½ well-characterized terminal phase especially for the C3D1 data where only 4 participants had a reportable t value. ½ PF-04518600 systemic exposure based on geometric mean AUC values appeared to tau increase in a dose proportional manner for the 0.3 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg dose range following co-administration with utomilumab for both the C1D1 and C3D1 data. Exposure for the 0.1 mg/kg dose was lower following both single and multiple dosing consistent with what was observed for the monotherapy treatment in Part A, which may be in part due to target-mediated drug disposition. Mean peak exposure based on geometric C values appeared to increase in a dose max proportional manner across all doses following both single and multiple dosing. R based on AUC following multiple dosing ranged between 1.361 to 1.861 across the ac tau dose range studied. Geometric mean CL ranged between 0.1339 mL/hr/kg to 0.2944 mL/hr/kg, with the higher mean CL value occurring at the 0.1 mg/kg dose. Variability in exposure based on geometric CV% ranged between 18%-73% (AUC and tau AUC ) and 19%-51% (C and C ) following single and multiple dose tau(dn) max max(dn) administration for C1D1 and C3D1, across all doses. Utomilumab PK Parameters Part B: Following administration of a 20 mg or 100 mg dose of utomilumab Q4W in combination with escalation IV doses in PF-04518600 administered Q2W, utomilumab geometric mean C values were generally observed at or shortly after the end of the 1 hour max infusion with a median T of 1.02 to 3.8 hours for C1D1 and approximately 1 hour for max C3D1. Terminal elimination phase was not well characterized, and t could not be reported for a ½ majority of profiles, especially for C3D1 data. Utomilumab systemic exposure based on geometric mean AUC values following a tau(dn) single (C1D1) combination dosing with escalating doses of PF-04518600 appeared to be relatively similar higher (approximately 1.4 fold) for the co-administration with PF-04518600 at the 0.1 mg/kg dose compared to the other combination treatments while geometric mean utomilumab C values on C1D1 appeared to be relatively similar across all max treatments. Following multiple dose co-administration of utomilumab with escalating doses of PF-04518600, utomilumab exposure based on AUC values were extremely variable across tau treatments and appeared to be lower than that observed following a single dose for 4 out of the 6 treatments. Geometric mean C values for utomilumab were also lower following max(dn) multiple dose co-administration with PF-04518600 on C3D1 compared to those observed on C1D1. Utomilumab R based on mean AUC values following multiple dosing on C3D1 ranged ac tau between 0.267 to 1.091 when co-administered with PF-04518600 at doses 0.3 mg/kg and above. Only 2 patients had utomilumab accumulation ratios determined following co-administration with PF-04518600 at the 0.1 mg/kg doses and these were 1.23 and 0.493. Utomilumab geometric mean CL values ranged between 0.036 mL/hr/kg to 0.148 mL/hr/kg, for combination treatments with PF-04518600 at doses 0.3 mg/kg and above. Variability in exposure based on geometric CV% of AUC and C ranged between tau max 15%-53% and 22%-43%, respectively for C1D1 and 31%-1524% and 22%-79%, respectively for C3D1 for utomilumab co-administered with PF-04518600 at doses 0.3 mg/kg and above.
