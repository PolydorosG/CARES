INTRODUCTION On 16 October 2018, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved TALZENNA® (talazoparib) for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)-mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients are selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for TALZENNA. The purpose of Study 673-201 (C3441008; ABRAZO), hereafter referred to as Study 673-201, was to test the hypothesis that treatment with a potent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, talazoparib, would result in clinical benefit as demonstrated by a significant overall response rate in patients with BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer. Study 673-201 was an open-label, 2-stage, 2-cohort Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of talazoparib as a single agent in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA mutations in 2 separate cohorts of patients: those who previously responded to a platinum-containing regimen without disease progression for >8 weeks following the last dose of platinum administered for metastatic breast cancer (Cohort 1), or those who were previously treated with more than 2 nonplatinum-containing cytotoxic regimens for metastatic disease (Cohort 2). The Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008) dated 09 February 2018 reported data from the primary information, the final analysis of efficacy endpoints, PK results, and preliminary safety results, ie, data for treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs), deaths, hematology, clinical chemistry, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). After the primary analysis, patients who were deemed to be benefitting clinically from treatment with talazoparib were allowed to continue treatment and were followed until study termination by the Sponsor. This Supplemental CSR (sCSR) presents the final analyses of safety data for patients in Study 673-201 from study start until study termination (LSLV) 31 October 2018. The decision to terminate the study was not due to any safety concerns. 8. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Please refer to Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Section 8 for full details of the study objectives. The objective for this sCSR is to present the final results of the safety data collected since study start until study termination (LSLV) 31 October 2018. 9. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 9.1. Overall Study Design and Plan: Description and Flow Chart This Phase 2, open-label, 2-cohort study evaluated talazoparib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with deleterious germline BRCA gene mutations using a Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 2-stage design. A total of 35 patients were enrolled in stage 1 of each of 2 cohorts. If 5 or more patients had an objective response in a cohort, an additional 35 patients were to be enrolled in stage 2 of that cohort, for a total of up to 140 patients in the study (objective responses were determined locally and did not require confirmation as part of the interim assessment; at the final analysis, objective responses were determined by central radiology and required a second confirmatory scan). Patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation were assigned to Cohort 1 or 2 based on prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease: Cohort 1: Patients with a documented complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to a prior platinum-containing regimen for metastatic disease, with disease progression more than 8 weeks after the last dose of platinum. For patients treated with more than 1 prior platinum-containing regimen, the response had to occur to the most recent regimen. Cohort 2: Patients who received more than 2 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease and no prior platinum therapy for metastatic disease. Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy with platinum was allowed if first disease recurrence was more than 6 months after the last dose of adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum. Refer to Appendix 16.1.1 of Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Protocol Section 9.1 for the Eligible patients 18 years of age who had provided informed consent, had locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to curative radiation or surgical cure and/or metastatic disease, and documentation of deleterious, suspected deleterious, or pathogenic germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation was required. All patients had to have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1, and adequate organ function as defined in Appendix 16.1.1 of Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Protocol Section 9.3.1. Patients had to have a PR or CR prior to a platinum-containing regimen for metastatic disease with disease progression >8 weeks following the last dose of platinum (Cohort 1) or >2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease and no prior platinum for metastatic disease (Cohort 2). For further details about eligibility criteria as well as criteria for removal of patients from treatment and life style guidelines, refer to Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Section 9.3. 9.8. Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses Changes in study conduct are described in Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Section 9.8. Changes to the planned analysis are described in Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Section 9.8.2 and in Appendix 16.1.9.1 of Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), SAP Section 10. 10. STUDY PARTICIPANTS 10.1. Disposition of Participants and Data Sets Analyzed Data in this sCSR is presented from study start until study termination (31 October 2018) for the intent-to-treat (ITT) and safety populations. The ITT population was defined as all patients with an enrollment date in the Enrollment electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and may have included patients that were not treated. The safety population was defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of talazoparib. Overall, 84 patients were included in the ITT population (Table 14.1.1.1). One (1) patient in Cohort 1 did not receive any study drug and was excluded from the safety population. The safety population included 83 patients from 2 cohorts (48 patients in Cohort 1 and 35 patients in Cohort 2) (Table 14.1.1.1). At the data cutoff date for the Full CSR (01 September 2016), 26 (31.0%) patients were ongoing in long-term follow-up (off treatment) (10 patients [20.4%] from Cohort 1 and 16 patients [45.7%] from Cohort 2), and 9 (10.7%) patients were ongoing in study drug treatment (on treatment) (5 patients [10.2%] in Cohort 1 and 4 patients [11.4%] in Cohort 2). These 35 patients (26 patients off treatment and 9 patients on treatment) continued to be followed after the data cutoff for the Full CSR. At the data cutoff for this sCSR (31 October 2018) the remaining 9 patients (10.7%) were discontinued from study due to study termination by Sponsor (Table 1). Two (2) of these patients were on treatment and were transferred to an open-label extension with an action taken of permanent discontinuation (Listing 16.3.4.1). A summary of patient disposition for all enrolled patients (ITT population) is presented in Table 1. The primary reason for study drug discontinuation for all patients was disease progression (84.5%), followed by AEs (6.0%), physician decision (4.8%), and withdrawal of consent (1.2%). The primary reason for study discontinuation for all patients was death (79.8%). Table 1.

Date of last patient discontinued study for 673-201 (C3441008) was 31 October 2018. For all percentages, the denominator is the number of patients in the ITT population. ITT = intent-to-treat; N = number of patients in treatment group. a. Two patients (one from each Cohort; Listing 16.2.1.2) did not discontinue the study drug and were instead transferred to open-label extension study C3441010 (MDV3800-13) to continue treatment with talazoparib.b.All patients were off this study (C3441008) as of 31 October 2018. 10.2. Protocol Deviations A listing of all protocol deviations for the ITT population is presented in Appendix 16.2.2. Major protocol deviations from study start until the last study site closed on 25 February 2019 for the ITT population are presented in Table 14.1.3.1. No new major protocol deviations occurred after the data cutoff for the primary analysis (01 September 2016) until the last study site closed on 25 February 2019. 10.3. Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics The median age of patients was 50.0 years (range of 31.0 to 75.0 years). Overall, 47.6% of the patients were <50 years, 35.7% of the patients were between 50 to <65 years, and 16.7% of the patients were 65 years or older (Table 2). and race was not reported for 19.0%. The proportions of each race were similar in each cohort but race was not reported for a higher proportion of patients in Cohort 2 (34.3% compared with 8.2% in Cohort 1). Median baseline weight was 67.5 kg (range of 40.0 to 122.3 kg) and median body mass index was 25.6 kg/m2 (range of 15.8 to 46.1 kg/m2).

Hormone-receptor status and BRCA mutation status are summarized by cohort and overall for the ITT population in Table 3. BRCA mutation status is listed by patient for the ITT population in Listing 16.2.4.2.1. Overall, the percentage of patients who had triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was 59.2% in Cohort 1 and 17.1% in Cohort 2 (Table 3). The percentage of patients with hormone-receptor positive disease (defined as either estrogen receptor [ER]-positive disease or progesterone receptor [PgR]-positive disease) was 40.8% for Cohort 1 and 82.9% for Cohort 2 (Table 3). Germline BRCA status was assessed by central and local laboratories for all 84 patients in the ITT population. Overall, 48.8% of patients were BRCA1-positive, 50.0% were BRCA2-positive, and 1 patient (1.2%) had a BRCA status of unknown or missing. In Cohort 1, 53.1% of the patients were BRCA1-positive and 44.9% were BRCA2-positive, and in Cohort 2, 42.9% of the patients were BRCA1-positive, 57.1% were BRCA2-positive. No patients were both BRCA1- and BRCA2-positive (Table 3). Table 3.

Oncology history by body system and preferred term (PT) for the ITT population is presented in Table 14.1.4.4. The median time since the initial diagnosis of breast cancer to first dose date was 5.0 years in Cohort 1 and 6.2 years in Cohort 2. The median time since the start date of first cytotoxic therapy for metastatic disease and the median time since the start date of first antineoplastic therapy for metastatic breast cancer were 1.9 years in Cohort 1 and 3.6 years in Cohort 2. Longer median times for Cohort 2 were expected, as patients in Cohort 2 had a higher incidence of hormone-receptor disease and likely initiated therapy for metastatic disease with hormonal therapy. Measurable disease was detected in 98.8% of all patients (100% of patients in Cohort 1 and 97.1% of patients in Cohort 2) by investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at baseline. For additional information on assessment see Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008). Similarly, measurable disease was reported for 92.9% of all patients (93.9% of patients in Cohort 1 and 91.4% of patients in Cohort 2) as assessed by an independent radiology facility (IRF) (Table 14.1.4.2.1). Two (2) patients (4.1%) in Cohort 1 and 3 patients (8.6%) in Cohort 2 did not have measureable disease by IRF assessment. The disease status of 1 patient (2.0%) in Cohort 1 was unknown, as this patient was not treated and so the baseline scans were not read by the IRF (Table 14.1.4.2.1). No patients had bone-only metastatic disease at baseline. The majority of patients (72.6%) had visceral disease at baseline by investigator assessment (77.6% of patients in Cohort 1 and 65.7% of patients in Cohort 2). The most common metastatic disease locations by investigator assessment were lymph nodes (59.5% of all patients [61.2% in Cohort 1 and 57.1% in Cohort 2]), bone (53.6% of all patients [53.1% in Cohort 1 and 54.3% in Cohort 2]), and liver (50.0% of all patients [46.9% in Cohort 1 and 54.3% in Cohort 2]). A history of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis was reported for 8 patients (16.3%) in Cohort 1 and for 1 patient (2.9%) in Cohort 2. At baseline, 55.1% of patients in Cohort 1 and 45.7% of patients in Cohort 2 had >2 metastatic sites. Per the study design (Appendix 16.1.1 of Full CSR 673-201 [C3441008], Protocol Section 9.1), no patients in Cohort 2 received prior treatment with a platinum agent for metastatic disease. In Cohort 1, patients had received at least 1 (and some more than 1) prior platinum treatment. Prior platinum treatments included carboplatin (87.8% of patients in Cohort 1) and cisplatin (20.4% of patients in Cohort 1) (Table 14.1.5.1). In Cohort 1, the median time from last platinum dose to disease progression was 4.06 months (range of 0.03 to 49.15 months) (Table 4). As previously noted, the protocol-specified platinum-free interval was 8 weeks, and enrollment of a patient with a platinum-free interval of 8 weeks was considered a major protocol violation (Section 10.2 of Full CSR 673-201 [C3441008]).

Prior Therapies for Breast Cancer All patients had prior therapy for advanced breast cancer, but patients in Cohort 2 were more heavily pretreated compared with patients in Cohort 1. Patients in Cohort 2 received more prior cytotoxic regimens with a median of 4 regimens (range of 1 to 9) compared with patients in Cohort 1 who received a median of 2 regimens (range of 1 to 10) (Table 14.1.5.2). However, 1 patient in Cohort 2 received less than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens; this was recorded as a major protocol deviation (Section 11.2.2, Full CSR 673-201 [C3441008]). The definition of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced disease did not include adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapies, hormonal therapies, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, targeted therapies, monoclonal antibodies, or immune-oncology (refer to Full CSR 673-201 [C3441008], Table 13). All prior antineoplastic therapies for breast cancer for the ITT population are summarized by World Health Organization (WHO) Drug classification in Table 14.1.5.1. Prior antineoplastic and cytotoxic therapies for advanced disease for the ITT population are summarized by WHO drug classification code in Table 14.1.5.3 and Table 14.1.5.4, respectively. Postbaseline antineoplastic therapies for the ITT population are presented by WHO drug classification code in Table 14.1.6.2. All prior treatments for cancer for the ITT population are listed by patient in Listing 16.2.4.3.1. 10.4. Measurements of Treatment Compliance Refer to Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Section 11.3. A total of 82 patients (98.8%) used 1 or more concomitant medications during the study treatment period (Table 5). As expected for patients with advanced breast cancer, commonly administered concomitant medications included corticosteroids, analgesics and narcotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and medications for nausea and vomiting. Concomitant medications used by 5 or more patients (≥6%) in the safety population are presented by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) level 2 classification and generic name in Table 5.

SAFETY EVALUATION At the data cutoff date for the Full CSR (01 September 2016), 35 patients remained on study with 26 patients in long-term follow-up (off treatment) and 9 patients in study drug treatment (on treatment). Safety data from these 35 patients who remained on study at the data cutoff of the Full CSR (01 September 2016) were collected through study termination (31 October 2018). At the time of study termination, 7 patients were in long-term follow-up and subsequently were discontinued from the study by the Sponsor; 2 patients were in study treatment (on treatment) and subsequently were discontinued from the study by the Sponsor and transferred to an open-label extension study (C3441010 [MDV3800-13]) to continue treatment with talazoparib. Cumulative safety summary tables have been generated from study start until database lock 12 December 2018 and are presented herein. As there were no substantial or clinically meaningful safety related changes since the primary analysis, minor variations between data in the Full CSR and data in this sCSR are not highlighted. Safety evaluations are presented in Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Section 12. 12.1. Extent of Exposure Extent of exposure for talazoparib is presented for the safety population in Table 7. The treatment-emergent period length for the safety population is summarized in Table 14.3.1.1.2. A total of 83 patients received at least 1 dose of talazoparib. Overall, the median duration of treatment was 5.5 months (range of 0.7 to 41.8 months). The median duration of treatment was 4.1 months (range of 1.0 to 41.8 months) in Cohort 1 and 6.0 months (range of 0.7 to 33.5 months) in Cohort 2 (Table 7). In Cohort 1, 35.4% of patients received 1 to <3 months of treatment, 27.1% of patients received 3 to <6 months of treatment, and 27.1% received 6 to <12 months of treatment. In Cohort 2, 14.3% of patients received 1 to <3 months of treatment, 37.1% received 3 to <6 months of treatment and 31.4% received 6 to <12 months of treatment. Median actual dose intensity, defined as the cumulative dose divided by the treatment duration, was similar defined as actual dose intensity divided by planned dose intensity, was also similar for each cohort: 84% in Cohort 1 (range of 39.1% to 100.0%) and 81.3% in Cohort 2 (range of 29.8% to 100.0%) (Table 7).  Dose modifications due to AEs are summarized in Table 8. Dose modification refers to either dose interruption or dose reduction. At least 1 dose reduction due to an AE occurred in 59.0% of patients. At least 1 dose reduction due to any cause occurred in 59.0% of all patients (Table 14.1.7.3). The median time to the first dose reduction due to AEs was 10.9 weeks in Cohort 1 and 13.3 weeks in Cohort 2 (Table 8). The time to first dose reduction due to an AE is plotted for each patient in the safety population in Figure 14.1.7.2.1. Dose interruptions for any cause were reported in 67.5% of all patients (Table 14.1.7.3) and dose interruptions for AEs were reported in 61.4% of all patients (Table 8).

Brief Summary of Adverse Events An overview of TEAEs is summarized for the safety population in Table 9. The overall incidence of TEAEs in the safety population was 97.6% and was approximately the same in both cohorts. Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported for 65.1% of all patients, and study drug-related AEs of any grade were reported for 95.2% of all patients. Approximately the same proportions of patients in each cohort had Grade 3 or higher events or study drug-related events. TESAEs were reported for 27.7% of all patients (33.3% of patients in Cohort 1 and 20.0% of patients in Cohort 2), and TESAEs related to study drug were reported in 13.3% of all patients (14.6% of patients in Cohort 1 and 11.4% of patients in Cohort 2). TEAEs leading to death were only reported for patients in Cohort 1 (4 patients; 8.3%) and none of the deaths were assessed as related to study drug (Listing 16.3.3.1). TEAEs that led to study drug discontinuation occurred in 6.0% of all patients (8.3% of patients in Cohort 1 and 2.9% of patients in Cohort 2) (Table 9). Table 9.

Adverse event grades are evaluated based on NCI-CTCAE (version 4.03). eCRF = electronic case report form; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; N = number of patients; NCI-CTCAE = National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. a. TEAEs with action taken of permanent discontinuation were taken from the Adverse Event eCRF. TEAEs of any grade regardless of relationship to study drug occurring in at least 10% of patients in either cohort are presented by SOC and PT in Table 10. The most frequent TEAE by SOC for all patients was Gastrointestinal disorders (72.3%), primarily due to nausea (42.2%), diarrhea (33.7%), vomiting (21.7%), constipation (18.1%), and abdominal pain (16.9%). The next 2 most frequent TEAEs by SOC for all patients were General disorders and administration site conditions (68.7%), of which fatigue was reported in 44.6% of patients, and Blood and lymphatic system disorders (65.1%), of which anemia (51.8%), thrombocytopenia (32.5%), and neutropenia (26.5%) were reported in more than 20% of patients.

TEAEs considered study drug-related by the investigator occurring in at least 10% of patients are summarized by decreasing frequency of PT in Table 16. TEAEs considered related to study drug by the investigator were reported for 95.2% of all patients (95.8% in Cohort 1 and 94.3% in Cohort 2). Anemia (49.4% of all patients [45.8% in Cohort 1 and 54.3% in Cohort 2]) was the most frequently occurring study drug-related TEAE among all patients, followed by fatigue (33.7% of all patients [41.7% in Cohort 1 and 22.9% in Cohort 2]), thrombocytopenia (31.3% of all patients [37.5% in Cohort 1 and 22.9% in Cohort 2]), and nausea (27.7% of all patients [31.3% in Cohort 1 and 22.9% in Cohort 2]). Neutropenia occurred in less than 25% of all patients, but occurred in 28.6% of patients in Cohort 2. All other TEAEs occurred in less than 25% of all patients, as well as less than 25% of patients in either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2.

TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher were assessed as unrelated to study drug treatment in 7.2% of all patients. In Cohort 1, 26 (54.2%) of patients experienced a TEAE of Grade 3 or higher assessed as related to study drug and in Cohort 2, 22 (62.9%) patients experienced a TEAE of Grade 3 or higher assessed as related to study drug. Anemia was the most frequent TEAE of Grade 3 or higher assessed as study drug-related in both cohorts, occurring in 27 (32.5%) patients overall (14 [29.2%] patients in Cohort 1 and 13 [37.1%] patients in Cohort 2). Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were the next most frequent TEAEs of Grade 3 or higher assessed as related to study drug treatment, occurring in 16.9% and 14.5% of all patients respectively. PT by relationship to study drug are presented in Table 17. All study drug-related TEAEs are summarized by SOC and PT in Table 14.3.1.1.7, by maximum severity in Table 14.3.1.1.7.1, and by decreasing frequency of PT in Table 14.3.1.1.7.2. Grade 3 or higher TEAEs are summarized by relationship to study drug, SOC, and PT in Table 14.3.1.2.3. Table 17. Grade 3 or Higher Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in at Least 2 Patients by Descending Frequency of Preferred Term by Relationship to Study Drug (Safety Population) In the previous sections, TEAEs reported in both treatment groups were presented and evaluated by severity, investigator-assessed relationship to study drug, treatment day of onset, and rate of occurrence per 100 patient-years of exposure. In this section, an analysis is presented for specific TEAEs, including those considered of special interest. Events of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were identified as TEAEs of special interest. Events of AML were analyzed by the Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) of ‘Malignant and unspecified tumors’ and MDS by the SMQ for ‘Myelodysplastic syndrome’. In addition, events of cytopenia (hematologic toxicity) were analyzed, as well as events of hepatic impairment analyzed by the SMQ ‘Drug-related hepatic disorders’. All PTs included in the SMQs ‘Cytopenia’, ‘AML/MDS’, and ‘Drug-related hepatic disorders’ are presented in Listing 16.3.13.1. Overall, 59 (71.1%) patients experienced at least 1 TEAE of cytopenia (33 [68.8%] patients in Cohort 1 and 26 [74.3%] patients in Cohort 2) (Table 18). No patients experienced any AML/MDS events. A total of 13 (15.7%) patients experienced at least 1 TEAE of drug-related hepatic disorders (7 [14.6%] patients in Cohort 1 and 6 [17.1%] patients in Cohort 2). There were no TEAEs of AML or MDS as defined by the SMQ ‘AML/MDS’ (Table 14.3.2.4.3 and Table 14.3.2.4.6; Figure 14.3.2.4.6.1). Time to first TEAEs of hepatic impairment as defined by the SMQ of “Drug-related hepatic disorders” is presented in Table 14.3.2.4.7. Table 18.

Potential Hy’s Law Cases An analysis of potential Hy’s Law cases was based on the Guidance for Industry Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation3. As stated in the Protocol (Appendix 16.1.1 of Full CSR 673-201 [C3441008]), Hy’s law cases are determined if they meet all of the following criteria:  AST or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increases to ≥3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (>5 × ULN if baseline ALT/AST is >3 and ≤5 × ULN)  Total bilirubin (TBL) increases to >2 × ULN and/or international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5 At Cohort Postbaseline, (7 met doubling of above baseline metastatic Although was the most likely etiology of findings. Thus, no Hy's law cases were identified. The liver function test results associated with Hy’s Law criteria are presented in Table 21. Table 21. Summary of Potential Hy’s Law Cases (Safety Population) Alopecia was reported in 20.5% of all patients with all cases considered to be mild (Grade 1; [Table 14.3.1.1.4]), presenting as patchy hair loss. Overall, the median onset was 3.0 months (range of 0.5-6.0 months) following talazoparib initiation (2.6 months [range of 0.5-6.0 months] in Cohort 1 and 3.5 months [range of 2.1-4.5 months] in Cohort 2) (Table 14.3.2.4.8). No patient discontinued from this trial due to alopecia (Table 14.3.2.3.2.1). 12.2.3.5. Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Myelodysplastic Syndrome Events of AML were analyzed by the SMQ of ‘Malignant and unspecified tumors’ and events of MDS were analyzed by the SMQ of ‘Myelodysplastic syndrome’. No patients reported a TEAE of AML or MDS (Table 18). 12.2.4. Listing of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Subject A listing of all TEAEs is presented by patient in Listing 16.3.1.1.

A listing of all deaths by patient is presented for the ITT population in Listing 16.3.5.1. Dose modifications and interruptions of study drug are presented by patient in Listing 16.2.5.2 and Listing 16.2.5.3, respectively. 12.2.5. Permanent Discontinuations Due to Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Overall, 5 (6.0%) patients permanently discontinued study drug due to a TEAE. Four (4) of these patients were in Cohort 1; 1 patient each experienced anemia (study drug-related), an increase in ALT (study drug-related), breast cancer metastatic, and dyspnea. In Cohort 2, 1 patient experienced both increased AST and increased blood ALP (both study drug-related). These results are summarized in Table 22 and Listing 16.3.4.1. Table 14.3.2.3.1 presents patients with TESAEs with action taken of permanent discontinuation (2 subjects) and Table 14.3.2.3.3.3 presents patients with TEAEs related to study drug with action taken of permanent discontinuation (3 subjects). TEAEs with action taken of permanent discontinuation of study drug omitting events of PD by decreasing frequency of PT are presented in Table 14.3.2.3.3.2.1. TEAEs related to study drug with action taken of permanent discontinuation of study drug omitting events of PD by decreasing frequency of PT are presented in Table 14.3.2.3.3.3.1. Permanent Discontinuation by System Organ Class and Preferred Term (Safety Population) Two (2) patients, both from Cohort 1, discontinued from study drug due to a TESAE. One had a Grade 5 neoplasm, and the other had Grade 5 metastatic breast cancer (Table 14.3.2.3.1.1). Full narratives are provided in Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Section 14.3.3 for all patients who experienced a TESAE, who experienced a TEAE (serious or non-serious) that was the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug, who died within 30 days after initiation or discontinuation of study drug, or who had a Grade 3 or 4 liver test result through the data cutoff date of 01 September 2016. Since the data cutoff date of 01 September 2016, narratives for ongoing patients who experienced a TESAE or died during the safety reporting period are provided as Council for Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) reports in Section 14.3.3 of this supplemental report. Note, there were no ongoing patients who experienced a TEAE (serious or non-serious) that was the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug during the safety reporting period. TEAEs associated with permanent discontinuation by decreasing frequency of PT are summarized in Table 14.3.2.3.3.2. TEAEs that were the primary reason for treatment discontinuation are summarized by SOC and PT in Table 14.3.2.3.2. Events TEAEs that led to interruption of study drug are presented by SOC and PT in Table 23. Overall, 62.7% of patients experienced an interruption of study drug due to a TEAE, and this proportion was similar in both patient cohorts. Dose interruptions from events in the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders occurred in 48.2% of all patients, and this was similar in both patient cohorts. Of these, 26 (31.3%) patients experienced anemia that led to study drug interruption. In Cohort 1, 11 anemia events were Grade 3, and 2 were Grade 2. In Cohort 2, all cases of anemia were Grade 3 (Table 14.3.2.3.5.2). Events of thrombocytopenia occurred 12 (25.0%) times in Cohort 1 and 5 (14.3%) times in Cohort 2. TEAEs in the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders led to study drug interruption in 6.0% of all patients, and all of these patients were in Cohort 1. Similarly, 4 of the 5 total cases of the PT fatigue in the SOC General disorders and administration site conditions occurred in Cohort 1. Events in the SOC Investigations that led to dose interruption occurred in 18.1% of all patients. Most of these events were classified under the PTs of Platelet count decreased (5 events [10.4%] in Cohort 1 and 2 events [5.7%] in Cohort 2) and Neutrophil count decreased (1 event [2.1%] in Cohort 1 and 4 events [11.4%] in Cohort 2). The number of events in the remaining SOCs were similar between the cohorts. Overall, anemia (26 events [31.3%]), thrombocytopenia (17 events [20.5%]), and neutropenia (12 events [14.5%]) were the 3 most common TEAEs by PT that led to dose interruption (Table 14.3.2.3.5.1). TEAEs leading to study drug dose reduction by descending frequency of PT are presented in Table 14.3.2.3.4.1. TEAEs leading to study drug dose reduction omitting events of PD by decreasing frequency of PT are presented in Table 14.3.2.3.4.1.1.

Deaths Deaths include those that occurred during the treatment-emergent safety reporting period that were recorded on the AE, treatment discontinuation, and death case report forms as well as deaths that occurred after the treatment-emergent safety reporting period that were recorded on the death CRF. This section will describe causes of death for all patients based on the death case report form as well as specific causes of death during the treatment-emergent period based on the AE CRF. A summary of all deaths in the ITT population since study start is provided in Table 25. A total of 69 deaths (82.1% of patients) occurred in this study; 40 (81.6%) occurred in Cohort 1 and 29 (82.9%) occurred in Cohort 2. Almost all deaths were attributed to PD (65 patients) or clinical PD (1 patient). The remaining 3 causes of death were: not stated (1 patient), patient died at home- no further information available (1 patient), and unknown (1 patient). No deaths occurred within 30 days after the first dose of study drug, and only 5 deaths (6.0%) occurred within 30 days of the last dose of study drug. The remaining 64 deaths (76.2%) occurred 30 days after the last dose of study drug. All deaths in the ITT population are listed by patient in Listing 16.3.5.1. Table 25.

Analysis and Discussion of Deaths, Other Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events In this advanced breast cancer population, TEAEs were most commonly observed in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain), General disorders and administration site conditions SOC (fatigue, asthenia), and Blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, platelet count decreased, dyspnea, and pleural effusion (Table 13). TESAEs were observed in 23 patients (27.7%) and were again primarily hematologic toxicity (anaemia, thrombocytopenia) or possibly related to underlying malignancy (pleural effusion, dyspnea, neoplasm progression, or breast cancer metastatic) (Table 28). Drug-related TESAEs were observed in 11 patients (13.3%), consisting of hematologic toxicity (anemia, thrombocytopenia, platelet count decreased), dyspnea, and neutropenic sepsis (Table 29). The majority of the deaths that occurred during this study (65 out of 69) resulted from disease progression; 4 deaths were attributed to other causes (1 each for clinical PD, not stated, patient died at home-no further information available, and unknown) (Table 25). Four (4) patients had at least 1 AE with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) severity Grade 5: 2 patients had progression of disease, 1 had dyspnea, and 1 had both breast cancer metastatic and pneumonia. None of the Grade 5 AEs were assessed as related to study drug by the investigator (Listing 16.3.2.1). Supporting the manageability of the observed toxicities, relative mean dose intensity was maintained in all patients at ≥80% (Table 7); only 3 patients permanently withdrew from study treatment due to a drug-related TEAE, and only 1 of these was due to hematologic toxicity (anemia) (Table 14.3.2.3.3.3). Most toxicities were managed by dose interruptions and/or dose reductions. Dose reduction most commonly occurred to the 0.75 mg/day level: 32.5% of patients required only a single dose reduction; 19.3% of patients had 2 dose reductions (from 1 to 0.75 to 0.5 mg) and 7.2% of patients had 3 (from 1 to 0.75 to 0.5 to 0.25 mg) dose reductions due to AEs (Table 8). Although hematologic toxicity was commonly observed, clinically significant clinical sequelae of hematologic toxicity were uncommon: there was 1 patient with neutropenic sepsis and 1 patient with Grade 3 hemorrhage (Table 19; Listing 16.3.2.1). Two (2) patients required colony stimulating factor: 1 patient required a platelet transfusion and 23 patients required RBC transfusions (Table 4.1.1). 12.4. Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Laboratory data collected and analyzed during the treatment-emergent period up to the PCD are summarized in Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Section 12.4. Laboratory data (not including hematology data) collected outside the treatment-emergent period are presented in listings. An updated summary of hematology data is presented in Section 12.4.2.1.1 as talazoparib is known to have hematological effects. 12.4.1. Listing of Individual Laboratory Values A by-patient listing of hematology laboratory evaluations is provided in Listing 16.3.6.1, and a by-patient value listing of the Grade 3 and 4 hematology laboratory evaluations is provided in Listing 16.3.6.2. No new clinically-significant changes in hematology laboratory values were identified. No additional chemistry laboratory evaluations were performed for this Supplemental Report, however by-patient listings of chemistry laboratory evaluations and Grade 3 and 4 chemistry laboratory evaluations from the analyses in Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008) are provided in Listing 16.3.7.1 and Listing 16.3.7.2, respectively. The following hematology laboratory parameters were graded using the CTCAE: hemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets. The following chemistry laboratory parameters were graded using the CTCAE: ALT, AST, albumin, ALP, bilirubin, calcium, creatinine, glucose, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, and sodium. Summary of hematology parameters by visit are presented in Tables 14.3.4.5.1 through 14.3.4.5.10. The mean and 95% CI for change from baseline by visit for hematology parameters are presented in Figures 14.3.4.5.1 through 14.3.4.5.10. 12.4.2.1. Laboratory Values over Time For summaries of hematology and chemistry laboratory data and changes from baseline by visit by cohort and overall in tables and changes from baseline by cohort in figures, please refer to Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), Section 12.4.2.1 and listings in this supplemental CSR. There were no clinically-significant differences in the hematology and chemistry laboratory data between the Full CSR and this sCSR. 12.4.2.1.1. Shifts in Hematology Parameters In Cohort 1, a higher proportion of patients demonstrated an increase of 2 CTCAE toxicity grades for lymphocytes and platelets (Table 30). A summary of increases in 2 or more CTCAE toxicity grades above baseline is presented for hematology parameters in Table 30. Grade 3 and 4 postbaseline hematology laboratory toxicities are presented in Table 14.3.4.3.1. Shifts from baseline for hematology parameters are presented in Tables 14.3.4.1.1 through 14.3.4.1.5.

Safety Conclusions In the conclusions presented below, “patients” refers to the safety population unless noted otherwise.  The median duration of treatment in Cohort 1 was 4.1 months (range of 1.0 to 41.8 months) and 6.0 months (range of 0.7 to 33.5 months) in Cohort 2.  Dose modifications for any cause occurred in 59.0% of all patients, and dose modifications due to AEs occurred in 59.0% of all patients.  Single dose reductions (from 1 to 0.75 mg) of talazoparib due to AEs were reported for 32.5% of patients; 19.3% and 7.2% of patients had 2 (from 1 to 0.75 to 0.5 mg) and 3 (from 1 to 0.75 to 0.5 to 0.25 mg) dose reductions for AEs, respectively. The median time to the first dose reduction due to AEs was 10.9 weeks in Cohort 1 and 13.3 weeks in Cohort 2.  Dose interruptions for any cause were reported in 67.5% of all patients and dose interruptions for AEs were reported in 61.4% of all patients. Gastrointestinal disorders SOC (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain), the General disorders and administration site conditions SOC (fatigue and asthenia), and the Blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia). In particular, hematologic toxicity was observed in 71.1% of all patients in this study.  Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported for 65.1% of all patients (64.6% of patients in Cohort 1 and 65.7% of patients in Cohort 2). Drug-related Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported for 57.8% of all patients (54.2% of patients in Cohort 1 and 62.9% of patients in Cohort 2). Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were primarily due to anaemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia. Anemia was the most frequent TEAE of Grade 3 or higher that was assessed as related to study drug, occurring in 32.5% of all patients.  Overall, TESAEs were reported for 27.7% of all patients (33.3% of patients in Cohort 1 and 20.0% of patients in Cohort 2). TESAEs related to study drug were reported for 13.3% of all patients (14.6% of patients in Cohort 1 and 11.4% of patients in Cohort 2). TESAEs that were assessed as not related to study drug occurred in 14.5% of all patients, and TESAEs that were assessed as related to study drug occurred in 13.3% of all patients. The most common TESAEs were in the SOC Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders, occurring in 12.0% of all patients. Events in this SOC were primarily from the PTs of pleural effusion or dyspnea. TESAEs with events in the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders were the second-most frequent, occurring in 10.8% of all patients and were mostly due to anemia. Anemia, pleural effusion, and dyspnea were the most frequent TESAEs by PT.  TEAEs leading to death were reported for 8.3% of patients in Cohort 1 and no patients in Cohort 2. TEAEs leading to death occurred in the PTs of neoplasm progression (2 patients), breast cancer metastatic (1 patient), dyspnea (1 patient), and pneumonia (1 patient). There were no drug-related deaths.  TEAEs led to study drug discontinuation in 6.0% of all patients (8.3% of patients in Cohort 1 and 2.9% of patients in Cohort 2). Drug-related TEAEs that led to study drug discontinuation were reported in 3 patients (Cohort 1: 1 patient with anemia and 1 patient with ALT increased; Cohort 2: 1 patient with both AST and blood ALP increased) (Listing 16.3.1.1). hematologic toxicity. The most frequent PTs for hematologic toxicity were anemia (51.8% of all patients), thrombocytopenia (32.5% of all patients), and neutropenia (26.5% of all patients). Hepatic impairment was observed in 15.7% of all patients. The most frequent PTs for hepatic impairment were AST increased (7.2% of all patients), ALT increased (4.8% of all patients), and blood ALP increased (3.6% of all patients). Mild alopecia was observed in 20.5% of all patients. No patients experienced AML/MDS events.  In the ITT population, a total of 69 deaths (82.1% of all patients) occurred. Almost all (65 of 69) of these deaths were attributed to PD; for the remaining 4 deaths not attributed to PD, the cause of death was listed as “other” (clinical PD, not stated, patient died at home-no further information available, and unknown). Of the 69 deaths, 5 occurred within 30 days after the last dose of study drug and were considered secondary to PD (Table 14.3.2.1.3). Four (4) patients were listed as having at least 1 TEAE with a fatal outcome, all of which were in Cohort 1. These TEAEs were considered unrelated to study drug (reported as PTs of neoplasm progression, breast cancer metastatic, pneumonia, and dyspnea). 13. DISCUSSION AND OVERALL CONCLUSIONS 13.1. Discussion At the data cutoff for this sCSR (31 October 2018), among the 9 patients who were either undergoing active treatment or in long-term follow-up, none had a treatment-emergent AE with an action taken of permanent discontinuation from study treatment, but all 9 patients were withdrawn from the study due to study termination by Sponsor. Of these 9 patients, 7 patients were in long-term follow-up and 2 patients were transited to Study C3441010 (MDV3800-13). Study 673-201 was undertaken to test the hypothesis that treatment with a potent PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, would result in clinical benefit as demonstrated by a significant overall response rate in patients with BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer. The study enrolled 2 distinct cohorts of patients with BRCA-mutant advanced breast cancer: patients who responded to prior platinum therapy (Cohort 1) and patients who had received at least 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for advanced breast cancer (Cohort 2). As noted in Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008), talazoparib demonstrated promising efficacy in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations with response to prior platinum therapy (Cohort 1) and in patients with at least 3 prior chemotherapy regimens (Cohort 2). Primary and secondary endpoints for Study 673-201 are discussed in Full CSR 673-201 (C3441008). At the data cutoff date for the Full CSR, 35 patients remained on study with 26 patients in long-term follow-up (off treatment) and 9 patients in study drug treatment (on treatment). Additional safety data from these patients was collected until they discontinued from the study or until the data cutoff for this sCSR, whichever occurred first. This additional data did (Full CSR 673-201 [C3441008]). No new safety signals were identified. 13.2. Conclusion On the basis of the results from this study, talazoparib has a manageable safety profile for the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer carrying a germline BRCA1/2 mutation. NOTE: Since this is a supplemental study report, not all of the tables applicable to a full study report are necessarily included. Therefore, there may be gaps in the sequences of table numbers. The report has been carefully reviewed to ensure that all relevant tables are present.          15. REFERENCES 1 Turner NC, Telli ML, Hope S. Rugo HS, et al.
