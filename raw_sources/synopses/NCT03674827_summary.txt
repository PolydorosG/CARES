METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose, safety, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity study to evaluate the components of VBIR-2 (PF-06936308) in participants with advanced NSCLC and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The VBIR-2 regimen consisted of 4 components: chimpanzee adenovirus 68 (AdC68; PF-06871923), plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (pDNA; PF-06871925), tremelimumab (PF-06753388), and sasanlimab (PF-06801591). The study included 2 parts, ie, Dose Escalation (Part 1) followed by Dose Expansion (Part 2) (Figure S1). Figure S1. Overall Study Design Part 1 was planned with 7 cohorts; Dose Escalation was completed after enrollment into 6 of them. Part 1 consisted of 2 cycles in the treatment period. Each cycle started with an AdC68 priming vaccination accompanied by administration of tremelimumab and sasanlimab (if applicable), followed by 3 monthly pDNA administration accompanied by administration of tremelimumab and sasanlimab (if applicable). After the treatment period, the maintenance treatment phase was to follow consisting of monthly doses of sasanlimab, with pDNA and tremelimumab given every 2 months. Participants were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal of consent. Part 2 was planned to have 1 cohort, where participants first entered an active treatment phase (includes 2 cycles of vaccine treatment, 4 months for each cycle), followed by a maintenance treatment phase. The active treatment phase was to include 2 cycles of VBIR-2 treatment. Each VBIR-2 cycle was to start with an AdC68 priming vaccination accompanied by administrations of tremelimumab and sasanlimab. Three monthly pDNA boost vaccinations along with concomitant administrations of tremelimumab and sasanlimab were planned to follow the AdC68 vaccination. The single AdC68 priming vaccination followed by 3 monthly pDNA boost vaccinations would have concluded 1 treatment cycle. The maintenance treatment phase was to consist of monthly doses of sasanlimab, with pDNA and tremelimumab given every 2 months. However, Part 2 was never opened to enrollment per the Sponsor’s decision. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Part 1: 1) adult participants (18 years) with histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced NSCLC or metastatic TNBC who have progressed (resistant to current therapy/no current therapy available/current therapy refused by participant); 2) a mandatory archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block or fresh tumor sample must be provided; 3) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1; 4) measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1; 5) adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver function. Part 2: 1) adult participants (18 years) with histological or cytological diagnosis of locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC; 2) ≤2 prior treatment regimens in the advanced disease setting, including targeted therapies and no more than 1 line of an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) as the most recent treatment.

AdC68 was administered on pDNA intramuscular injections were given bilaterally. pDNA injections were administered beginning on Day 29 of Cycles 1 and 2 and were then given at 4-week intervals. After Cycle 2, pDNA was administered every 2 months in the Maintenance Treatment Period. Tremelimumab was administered bilaterally subcutaneously (in close proximity to the vaccination site) at 4-week intervals during Cycles 1 and 2 on the same day as the AdC68 or pDNA dosing. Both AdC68 and pDNA injections were given prior to tremelimumab administration. After Cycle 2, tremelimumab was administered every 2 months in the Maintenance Treatment Period. Sasanlimab was administered bilaterally subcutaneously (in close proximity to the vaccination site) at 4-week intervals on the same day as the AdC68 or pDNA and tremelimumab during Cycles 1 and 2. The AdC68, pDNA, and tremelimumab (if applicable) were given prior to sasanlimab administration. During the Maintenance Treatment Period, participants were treated with sasanlimab. Participants were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal of consent. Efficacy Evaluations: Tumor assessments included all known or suspected sites of disease. Imaging included (a) computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of these same areas, and (b) bone scan, for participants with known or suspected bone metastases. Anti-tumor activity was to be assessed at baseline; postbaseline every 12 weeks for Part 1 and every 8 weeks for Part 2, up to Week 32; whenever disease progression was suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration); and at the time of withdrawal from treatment (if not done in the previous 6 weeks). Assessments of response were made using RECIST version 1.1. Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Evaluations: Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Blood samples were collected from participants receiving tremelimumab and sasanlimab to evaluate their serum concentration. PK samples were assayed using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively, in compliance with Sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs). Immunogenicity Evaluations: Blood samples were collected from participants receiving tremelimumab and sasanlimab to detect ADA and NAb against these compounds. Samples were analyzed using ECL in compliance with Sponsor’s SOPs. Only those samples tested positive for ADA were further tested for NAb. Safety Evaluations: Safety assessments included DLTs, AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), vital signs and physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG [12-lead]), laboratory assessments. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: The main efficacy analysis populations were based on modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and evaluable population. mITT analysis set was defined as all enrolled participants who received at least one dose of all regimen components administered on Cycle 1 Day 1. Disease response was presented in the form of participant data listings. Summary of ORR and CBR were to be provided by descriptive statistics. The Kaplan-Meier methods were used to analyze all time to event endpoints. Pharmacokinetics: The concentration-time data for tremelimumab and sasanlimab were summarized descriptively by dose and nominal time, respectively. The concentration-time data of tremelimumab and sasanlimab after the first dose were analyzed individually by non-compartmental methods to determine the PK parameters. Immunogenicity: For participants receiving tremelimumab or sasanlimab, the percentage of participants with positive ADA and NAb was summarized by dosing cohort, respectively. For participants with positive ADA, the magnitude (titer), time of onset, and duration of ADA response (in weeks and months) were described respectively for each compound, if data permitted. Time of onset was calculated as (date of first positive ADA result - date of first dose of tremelimumab/sasanlimab + 1). The duration of ADA response was calculated as (Date of last positive ADA result - date of first positive ADA result + 1). Relevant descriptive statistics (namely mean, median, standard deviation [SD], min, max) was summarized for the magnitude (titer), time of onset, and duration of ADA response in weeks and months. Safety: DLT was analyzed based on the Per Protocol (PP) analysis set. The PP analysis set included all enrolled participants who received at least one dose of all regimen components administered on Cycle 1 Day 1 of study medication and who did not have major protocol deviations during the 28 days after the first vaccination. For the purpose of dose escalation, any of the following AEs occurring in the first 28 days following the first AdC68 vaccination that were considered possibly related to study treatment and were not considered related to disease/progression were classified as DLTs: Hematologic: Grade ≥3 neutropenia lasting >7 days; Febrile neutropenia (febrile neutropenia >38.3C, or 101F, or a sustained temperature of 38C, or 100.4F, for more than one hour); Grade 3 neutropenic infection; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with ≥ Grade 2 clinically significant bleeding (for bleeding events with no grading available, clinically significant bleeding was defined as requiring hospitalization or urgent medical intervention); Grade 3 anemia lasting more than 7 days; Grade 3 lymphopenia lasting more than 14 days. Nonhematologic: Grade ≥3 AEs that were considered non-hematologic, non-hepatic major organ toxicity (excluding alopecia of any grade; Grade 3 nausea/vomiting or diarrhea <72 hours with adequate antiemetic and other supportive care; ≥ Grade 3 electrolyte abnormality that lasted <24 to 72 hours, was not clinically complicated, and resolved spontaneously or responded to conventional medical interventions); Grade 3 flu-like symptoms lasting greater than 3 days with adequate treatment; Fever of >40.0°C, or 104.0°F, lasting for more than 3 days with adequate treatment; Concurrent aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3× upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin >2× ULN (potential Hy’s law case); Nonhematologic laboratory abnormalities: Grade ≥3 laboratory abnormalities either associated with symptoms or associated with worsening of an existing condition or that suggested a new disease process or that required additional active management (eg, discontinuation of the drug, close observation, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation or specific treatment). In addition, clinically important or persistent toxicities that were not included in the above criteria might be considered a DLT following review by the Sponsor and the investigators. All DLTs needed to represent a clinically significant shift from baseline. The following AEs were not adjudicated as DLTs: Isolated Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities that were not associated with clinical sequelae and were corrected with supplementation/appropriate management within 72 hours of onset. AEs constituting DLTs were listed per dose level. Safety parameters other than DLTs were assessed based on the safety analysis set. The safety analysis set included all enrolled participants who received at least one dose of one of the components of the regimen. AEs were graded by the investigator according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries was on TEAEs, those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study treatment. The number and percentage of participants who experienced any AE, SAE, treatment-related AE, and treatment-related SAE were summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The summaries presented AEs both on the entire study period by dose and by cycle. Laboratory assessments included hematology, coagulation, chemistry, and urinalysis. The number and percentage of participants who experienced laboratory test abnormalities were summarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assay. The analyses Cycles beyond 1). Shift tables were provided to examine the distribution of laboratory toxicities. ECG results were analyzed based on baseline and on-treatment ECG data. Baseline was defined as the pre-dose ECG collected before the first dose of any component of the study treatment. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate measurements) were used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Shift tables were provided for baseline versus worst on treatment corrected QT using Maximum CTCAE Grade. Shift tables were also provided for ECG abnormality at baseline versus on treatment (yes, no, not done: [n, %]). Participants experiencing clinically-relevant morphological ECG changes were summarized (including frequency and percentage). Vital signs included measurements of blood pressure (BP), pulse, and temperature (oral, temporal, ear). Absolute values and changes from baseline for systolic and diastolic BP and pulse rate were summarized by cohort, treatment and time post dose, according to the Sponsor’s reporting standards. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: Thirty-six participants were enrolled and treated in Part 1 of the study.  3 participants were treated with AdC68 2 × 1011 VP and pDNA 5 mg in Cohort 1A;  5 participants were treated with AdC68 6 × 1011 VP and pDNA 5 mg in Cohort 2A;  3 participants were treated with AdC68 6 × 1011 VP, pDNA 5 mg, and tremelimumab 40 mg in Cohort 3A;  4 participants were treated with AdC68 6 × 1011 VP, pDNA 5 mg, tremelimumab 40 mg, and sasanlimab 130 mg in Cohort 4A;  5 participants were treated with AdC68 6 × 1011 VP, pDNA 5 mg, tremelimumab 40 mg, and sasanlimab 300 mg in Cohort 5A;  16 participants were treated with AdC68 6 × 1011 VP, pDNA 5 mg, tremelimumab 80 mg, and sasanlimab 300 mg in Cohort 6A. The most frequent reason for treatment discontinuation was progressive disease (24 participants, 66.7%); only 2 patients (5.6%) discontinued due to adverse events (Table S4). CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS The mean age of the participants was 60.39 years (SD: 11.33). Twenty-four (66.7%) participants were female. Most (32, 88.9%) of the participants were White. Seventeen of the participants had a diagnosis of TNBC, and 19 of them had a diagnosis of NSCLC. Efficacy Results: Objective Response Rate: No objective responders (CR or PR per RECIST v1.1) were observed. Progression Free Survival: Median PFS was 1.8 months for NSCLC and 1.7 months for TNBC. Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Results: Pharmacokinetic: Serum sasanlimab PK parameters for Cohort 4A and 5A are summarized in Table S5. AUC , CL/F and t could not be reported due to the lack of a well-characterized terminal inf ½ phase for all profiles. R was not calculated because trough concentration prior to the ac,Ctrough fifth dose (on Cycle 2 Day 1) were not collected for any participants in Cohort 4A or 5A. Serum tremelimumab PK parameters for Cohort 3A and 6A are summarized in Table S6. AUC , CL/F and t could not be reported due to the lack of a well-characterized terminal inf ½ phase for all profiles. Immunogenicity: Sasanlimab : Two (9.1%) participants tested positive for ADA against sasanlimab at baseline and no one had treatment boosted ADA (N=22 evaluable participants). Therefore, the overall incident rate for ADA against sasanlimab was 0. Nab to sasanlimab was examined only for the 4 ADA positive samples and no sample was found to be positive for NAb. Tremelimumab: No participant had positive ADA against tremelimumab at baseline (N=25 evaluable participants). Treatment-induced ADA was found in only 1 participant, therefore, the overall incidence was 4%. For that participant, the ADA was first found at Day 61 post dose after the administration of AdC68 6 × 1011 VP + pDNA 5 mg + tremelimumab 80 mg and sasanlimab 300 mg. The titer of ADA was 59.30. NAb to tremelimumab was not examined. Safety Results: Extent of Exposure: The median duration of treatment in the 36 participants was 29 days (range: 1-394). Dose Limiting Toxicity: No DLTs were reported in this study. Adverse Events: All 36 participants were reported with all-causality TEAEs. The most commonly reported all-causality TEAEs by preferred term (PT) were injection site pain (14 participants, 38.9%), dyspnoea (12 participants, 33.3%), and nausea (11 participants, 30.6%). Twenty-eight (77.8%) participants were reported with treatment-related TEAEs. The most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs were injection site pain (12 participants, 33.3%) and influenza like illness (9 participants, 25.0%). Eighteen (50%) participants were reported with all-causality SAEs, none of which were treatment-related. The most frequently reported all-causality SAEs were neoplasm progression (5 participants, 13.9%) and disease progression (4 participants, 11.1%). Sixteen (44.4%) participants died in this study. TEAEs with fatal outcome (Grade 5 TEAEs) were reported for 16 (44.4%) participants, none of which were treatment-related. The most frequent Grade 5 TEAEs were neoplasm progression (5 participants, 13.9%), disease progression (4 participants, 11.1%), and respiratory failure (3 participants, 8.3%). No participants were reported with dose reduction due to TEAEs. Two (5.6%) participants temporarily discontinued due to all-causality TEAEs, 1 of which were treatment-related. Eight (22.2%) participants permanently discontinued due to all-causality TEAEs, 1 of which were treatment-related. One (2.8%) participant had both permanent discontinuation and temporary discontinuation due to treatment-related TEAEs of aspartate aminotransferase increased and alanine aminotransferase increased. Laboratory Tests: The most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities experienced by ≥3 (8.3%) participants with shifts from less than or equal to Grade 2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline are listed below:  Lymphocyte count decreased was reported for 3 participants.  Aspartate aminotransferase increased was reported for 3 participants.  Hyperglycemia was reported for 3 participants.  Hyponatremia was reported for 3 participants.  Hypophosphatemia was reported for 3 participants. Vital Signs: No participants were reported with sitting systolic BP <90 mmHg. Three (8.3%) participants were reported with sitting diastolic BP value <50 mmHg. Two (5.6%) participants were reported with sitting systolic BP maximum increase from baseline ≥30 mmHg; 5 (13.9%) participants were reported with sitting diastolic BP maximum increase from baseline ≥20 mmHg. Four (11.1%) participants were reported with sitting systolic BP maximum decrease from baseline ≥30 mmHg, and 5 (13.9%) participants were reported with sitting diastolic BP maximum decrease from baseline ≥20 mmHg. Electrocardiogram: None of the participants had a QTcF interval ≥480 msec or maximum increase in QTcF interval ≥30 msec from baseline. Conclusions: Efficacy  None of the participants with NSCLC or TNBC achieved a CR or PR (ORR: 0%). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of median PFS were 1.8 and 1.7 months for participants with NSCLC and TNBC, respectively. Safety  VBIR-2 administration was generally safe with manageable toxicities in participants with NSCLC or TNBC.  No DLTs were reported.  Twenty-eight (77.8%) participants were reported with treatment-related TEAEs, the most commonly reported being injection site pain (12 participants, 33.3%) and influenza like illness (9 participants, 25.0%). The majority (26 participants, 72.2%) of participants experienced Grade 1 or 2 treatment-related TEAEs. Two (5.6%) participants experienced Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related TEAEs (1 for each grade, 2.8%), and no Grade 5 treatment-related TEAEs were reported. Pharmacokinetics  Following the combination therapy in Cohort 4A and 5A, in which 130 and 300 mg sasanlimab were SC administered, median T of sasanlimab was 165.0 and max 251.5 hours and geometric mean AUC for sasanlimab was 5022000 and 672 7517000 ng•hr/mL, respectively. After 130 mg to 300 mg SC administration, the Cmax and AUC increase did not appeared linear. 672  Following combination therapy in Cohort 3A and 6A in which 40 and 80 mg tremelimumab were SC administered, median T of tremelimumab was 284.0 and max 166.0 hours and geometric mean AUC for tremelimumab was 904000 and 672 2373000 ng•hr/mL, respectively. R was determined for 1 participant in ac,Ctrough Cohort 3A which was 1.18 and 2 participants in Cohort 6A which were 1.29 and 2.11. After 40 mg to 80 mg SC administration, the C and AUC increase appeared max 672 approximately linear. Immunogenicity  Due to the limited immunogenicity data that were available from this study, the immunogenicity assessment was inconclusive.
