GENERIC DRUG NAME: Trastuzumab COMPOUND NUMBER: PF-05280014 PROTOCOL NO.: B3271002 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-Blind Study of PF-05280014 Plus Paclitaxel Versus Trastuzumab Plus Paclitaxel for the First-Line Treatment of Patients with HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer STUDY CENTERS: There were 168 sites in 25 countries which received study drug (across the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe), of which 12 sites did not screen or randomize patients (4 sites in Greece, 2 in Portugal, 1 in Puerto Rico, and 5 in the United States [US]). The remaining 156 sites in 24 countries screened at least 1 patient. Of the 156 sites, 143 sites in 24 countries randomized patients; 2 were in Argentina, 10 in Brazil, 3 in Chile, 1 in the Czech Republic, 3 in Greece, 2 in Hungary, 9 in India, 14 in Japan, 8 in the Republic of Korea, 1 in Latvia, 3 in Mexico, 3 in Peru, 8 in Philippines, 5 in Poland, 2 in Portugal, 7 in Romania, 29 in the Russian Federation, 3 in Serbia, 2 in Slovakia, 8 in South Africa, 2 in Thailand, 6 in Turkey, 11 in Ukraine, and 1 in the US. Study Initiation Date and Primary Completion or Final Completion Dates: First Patient First Visit: 24 February 2014; Data Cutoff Date (Week 33 Analysis): 24 August 2016; Data Snapshot Date (Week 33 Analysis): 12 October 2016 Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Primary Objective To compare the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer who received PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel to those who received trastuzumab-EU in combination with paclitaxel. Secondary Objectives • To evaluate the safety of PF-05280014 plus paclitaxel versus trastuzumab-EU plus paclitaxel; • To evaluate secondary measures of tumor control; • To evaluate the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU; Study Design: This was an international, double-blind, randomized, Phase 3 clinical study evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel versus trastuzumab-EU with paclitaxel in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in the first-line treatment setting. The primary endpoint was ORR. Central radiology review was the basis for the primary analysis. Secondary endpoints included safety, duration of response (DOR), 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate, 1-year survival rate, selected peak and trough drug concentrations, and immunogenicity. The hypothesis to be tested in this study was that the risk ratio of ORR of PF-05280014 versus that of trastuzumab-EU by Week 25 (and subsequently confirmed at Week 33) was within a pre-specified equivalence margin of 0.80 to 1.25. At study entry, patients were required to have evidence of HER2-positive breast cancer. The requirement for HER2-positive tumor status at study entry was updated in protocol Amendment 2 (dated 10 July 2014) and was based on: • Local testing that was documented to have used a sponsor-approved analytical method; or • Central testing during the Screening period performed by the sponsor-provided central laboratory; or • Local testing using both immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization analytical test kits, neither of which were considered sponsor-approved, for which both results were unequivocal. Tumor tissue blocks or unstained slides were required to be collected and sent to the sponsor-provided central laboratory for all patients for standardized, retrospective evaluation of HER2 status. The primary analysis for study outcome was based on all patients irrespective of HER2 status, as documented at the time of randomization. Patients determined not to be HER2 positive by central laboratory evaluation were excluded from the per protocol (PP) population. Patients were randomized (1:1) using an automated interactive web based response system to receive PF-05280014 plus paclitaxel or trastuzumab-EU plus paclitaxel. Randomization was stratified by: • Prior trastuzumab exposure (Yes/No); • Estrogen receptor (ER) status (ER positive versus ER negative). The most recent protocol (Amendment 4, dated 16 March 2017) and protocol Amendment 3 (dated 27 September 2016) were both implemented after the data cutoff date for this public an overview of the protocol visits and procedures. A schedule of events during continuation treatment with trastuzumab monotherapy and a tumor assessment workflow are provided in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. Table 1.

Schedule of Activities Abbreviations: ADA=anti-drug antibodies; CT=computed tomography; ECG=electrocardiogram; ECOG=Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; ECHO=echocardiogram; eCRF=electronic Case Report Form; EOT=End of Treatment; ER=estrogen receptor; HBsAg=hepatitis B surface antigen; HBcAb=hepatitis B core antibody; HCVAb=hepatitis C virus antibody; HER2=human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; HIV=human immunodeficiency virus; LVEF=left ventricular ejection fraction; mAb=monoclonal antibody; MRI=magnetic resonance imaging; MUGA=multi-gated acquisition scan; NAb=neutralizing antibody; PK=pharmacokinetic. a. End of Treatment: Evaluation performed at least 28 days after last dose. b. Follow-up: After discontinuation of treatment, patient survival status was collected by telephone contact every 2 months (±14 days) until death or 1 year from patient randomization and at least 6 months following receipt of last study drug, whichever was longer. c. Informed Consent: Was required to be obtained prior to undergoing any study specific procedure and could occur prior to the 28-day Screening period. d. Medical History and Demographics: Information on prior anti-tumor regimens and last relapse date. e. Physical Examination: A complete physical examination was conducted at Screening and End of Treatment only. All other evaluations were symptom-directed evaluations. Height was recorded at Screening only. f. Vital Signs: Temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate were recorded at all indicated time points. Height was recorded at Screening only. Weight was recorded at Screening, Day 1 of each cycle, and as clinically indicated. The weight from Day 1 of each cycle was used to calculate the dosage of trastuzumab to be administered on Day 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle provided there had not been, in the opinion of the investigator, a clinically significant change in body weight. Of note, if it was a site’s standard practice to measure weight weekly, the weight obtained at the previous week/visit could be used to calculate the dosage of trastuzumab to be administered at the current week/visit (eg, the Day 22 weight could be used to calculate the dosage for the subsequent cycle Day 1) provided there had not been, in the opinion of the investigator, a clinically significant change in body weight. If the Table 1. Schedule of Activities ±2 ±2 ±2 ±4 ±2 ±2 ±2 ±14 patient had experienced a weight change that was considered clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator, the patient was required to be weighed prior to dosing and that weight was used to calculate the dosage. If the dosage of trastuzumab was calculated using a weight that was NOT collected on Day 1 of a cycle, that weight was required to be recorded on an Unplanned vital signs eCRF. Vital signs were taken as follows around trastuzumab infusions: - Cycle 1, Day 1 before, within 10 minutes post-trastuzumab infusion, and within 1 to 2 hours post-trastuzumab infusion, and - On subsequent treatment days – before and within 10 minutes post-trastuzumab infusion. g. HER2 Status: Required documentation of HER2 gene amplification or HER2 overexpression. Sponsor-provided central laboratory was available for screen testing for patients with unknown status. h. ER Testing: Only for patients with unknown status. Required documentation of ER status. i. Hematology and Chemistry: Hematology and chemistry assessments were performed using local laboratories. Additional hematology or chemistry assessments could be performed according to standard of care or as clinically indicated. A visit window of -1 day was allowed for the hematology and chemistry assessments required prior to dosing on Cycle 1, Day 1. Note: the hematology and chemistry labs needed to be performed once within the Screening period and again prior to dosing on Cycle 1, Day 1. If the site was able to have the hematology and chemistry results turned around on the same day such that they could confirm the patient’s eligibility and dose on the same day, the same draw could be used for Screening and Cycle 1, Day 1; however it should be noted that adopting such a strategy could be problematic for a patient if the lab results were not favorable on the intended Cycle 1, Day 1. j. Pregnancy Test: For patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test with sensitivity of at least 10 mIU/mL was to be performed by the local laboratory at Screening, within 1 week before study drug administration. A negative pregnancy result was required before the patient could receive the study drug. Pregnancy tests were also done whenever 1 menstrual cycle was missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy was otherwise suspected), on Day 1 of each cycle, and at the End of Treatment visit to confirm the patient had not become pregnant during the study. Additional pregnancy testing may have been necessary if required by local practices or regulations. k. Contraception Check: At each study visit, for patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, were biologically capable of having children and were sexually active, the investigator confirmed and documented consistent and correct use of 2 highly effective methods of contraception. l. Viral disease screening tests: HBsAg, HBcAb, HCVAb, and HIV were to be conducted by local laboratory where required by local regulations or if warranted by patient history. m. Randomization: All Screening procedures, laboratory results and repeat laboratory results were required to be completed and reviewed within the Screening period prior to randomization. Randomization of eligible patients was preferred to be no more than 4 business days before administration of first dose of study drug. n. Tumor Assessments: CT or MRI of chest and abdomen and any other site of disease clinically indicated, were required at Screening for all patients, Table 1. Schedule of Activities ±2 ±2 ±2 ±4 ±2 ±2 ±2 ±14 within 6 weeks prior to randomization. Assessments during treatment were required every 8 weeks from randomization through Week 41, at Week 53 and then every 12 weeks until discontinuation from study. Assessments were NOT to be scheduled based on the previous imaging time point, but rather based on the calendar from date of randomization. The allowable window for disease assessments was ±14 days. o. Bone Scans: Required at Screening for all patients, within 12 weeks prior to randomization. If positive for breast cancer bone lesions at Baseline, subsequent assessments were to be performed to confirm partial or complete response by Week 33 if not performed earlier, or at any time if patients described increased bone pain or a new bone pain, or other signs/symptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggesting progressive bone disease. p. Adverse Events: Serious adverse events were to be monitored and recorded from the time that the patient provided informed consent through and including 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Patients were to be followed for adverse events from the first day of study drug through and including 6 months after the last dose of study drug. q. Prior and Concomitant Medication/Non-Drug Treatments: Medications and non-drug treatments were verified at Screening and monitored continuously by the investigator. Table 2. Schedule of Activities for Pharmacokinetic, Anti-Drug Antibodies, and Serum HER2 Assessments HER2 level Abbreviations: ADA=anti-drug antibodies; eCRF=electronic Case Report Form; FU=follow-up; HER2=human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; hr/hrs=hour/hours; min=minutes; NAb=neutralizing antibodies; PK=pharmacokinetic. a. Sampling at pre-trastuzumab dose for every 3 cycles continued as long as treatment with trastuzumab continued. b. If it was suspected during the safety evaluation that adverse events were immunogenicity-related (per judgment of the investigator), ADA/NAb and drug concentration samples at approximately 12-week intervals were collected until resolution of the adverse event. c. For patients who received any trastuzumab-containing product after discontinuation of study drug, every effort was made to collect samples for ADA/NAb and drug concentration prior to beginning treatment with the subsequent trastuzumab product (not necessary if fewer than 4 weeks had elapsed since end of study drug) and again between 2 and 4 months after the start of the subsequent therapy. d. If the duration of infusion differed from the planned duration, the sampling time was adjusted accordingly to occur at 1 hour post the end of the trastuzumab infusion. e. Every effort was made to collect these PK samples at the exact nominal times relative to the infusions of trastuzumab, while a variation window was allowed for each sampling time point. The actual time of each sample collection was recorded on the source document (eg, eCRF). In the event that a patient missed a trastuzumab dose but planned to remain on subsequent treatment, efforts were made to collect the pre-dose PK sample scheduled on the planned dosing day; however, if applicable, any 1-hour post-infusion PK sample was not needed.

End of Treatment: Evaluation performed at least 28 days after last dose. b. Follow-up: After discontinuation of treatment, patient survival status was collected by telephone contact every 2 months (±14 days) until death or 1 year from patient randomization and at least 6 months following receipt of last study drug, whichever was longer. c. Physical Examination: A complete physical examination was to be conducted at End of Treatment. All other evaluations were symptom-directed evaluations. d. Vital Signs: Temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate were recorded at all indicated time points. Weight was recorded at Day 1 of each cycle, and as clinically indicated. The weight from Day 1 of each cycle was used to calculate the dosage of trastuzumab to be administered on Day 1 of each cycle. Vital signs were taken before and within 10 minutes post-trastuzumab infusions. e. Hematology and Chemistry: Hematology and chemistry assessments were performed using local laboratories. Additional hematology or chemistry assessments could be performed according to standard of care or as clinically indicated. Table 3.

Pregnancy Test: For patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 10 mIU/mL, was performed by the local laboratory whenever 1 menstrual cycle was missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy was otherwise suspected), on Day 1 of each cycle, and at the End of Treatment visit to confirm the patient had not become pregnant during the study. Additional pregnancy testing may have been necessary if required by local practices or regulations. g. Contraception Check: At each study visit, for patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, were biologically capable of having children and were sexually active, the investigator confirmed and documented consistent and correct use of 2 highly effective methods of contraception consistently and correctly. h. Tumor Assessments: CT or MRI of chest, abdomen and any other site of disease clinically indicated, required every 8 weeks through Week 41, at Week 53 and then every 12 weeks. Assessments were not to be scheduled based on the previous imaging time point. The allowable window for disease assessments was ±14 days. i. Bone Scans: Assessments were to be performed if patients described increased bone pain or a new bone pain, or other signs/symptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggested progressive bone disease. j. Adverse Events: Serious adverse events should have been monitored and recorded from the time that the patient provided informed consent through and including 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Patients were required to be followed for adverse events from the first day of study drug through and including 6 months after the last dose of study drug. k. Concomitant Medication and Non-Drug Treatments: Medications and non-drug treatments were required to be monitored continuously by the investigator. Table 4.

Screening CT/MRI scans must have occurred within 6 weeks prior to randomization. Bone scans must have occurred within 12 weeks prior to randomization. b. Tumor assessment was done during the treatment period, every 8 weeks through Week 41, at Week 53 and then every 12 weeks (±14 days) until radiographically documented PD as per RECIST 1.1, study drug discontinuation, initiation of new anticancer therapy or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation (eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow-up), whichever occurred first. The Schedule of Assessments was fixed according to the calendar, regardless of treatment delays/interruptions. Imaging assessments were to be scheduled using the randomization date as the reference date for all time points and were NOT to be scheduled based on the date of the previous imaging time point. Imaging assessment delays to conform to treatment delay was not permitted. The same tumor assessment technique was used throughout the study for a given lesion/patient unless contraindicated. c. Patients who had already demonstrated objective disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 did not need to have scans repeated at the End of Treatment visit or during the post treatment follow-up. For patients who did not have documented objective disease progression at time of study drug discontinuation, tumor assessment continued to be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments until documented objective disease progression, initiation of new anticancer therapy, or discontinuation of patient from overall study participation (eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow-up). d. The CT scans were required to be performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons. If IV contrast was medically contraindicated, the imaging modality to be used to follow the disease (either CT without contrast or MRI) was the modality which best evaluated the disease, and the choice was determined by the investigator in conjunction with the local radiologist. Depending on the adequacy for evaluation of disease, a combination of CT without contrast and MRI should most often have been used. CT without contrast was preferred for evaluation of lesions in lung parenchyma. MRI was not adequate for evaluation of lung parenchyma but could also be performed to evaluate all other aspects of the chest. MRI of the abdomen and pelvis could substitute for CT with contrast unless the method did not adequately depict the individual’s disease, in which case CT without contrast was preferred. e. Radiographic assessments obtained per the patient’s standard of care prior to randomization into the study did not need to be repeated and were Table 4. Tumor Assessment Flowchart Screeninga Treatment Period b Confirmation of Response End of Treatment Visitc acceptable to use as Baseline evaluations, if (1) obtained within 6 weeks before randomization, (2) they were performed using the method requirements outlined in RECIST 1.1 (3) the same technique/modality could be used to follow identified lesions throughout the study for a given patient, and (4) appropriate documentation indicating that these radiographic tumor assessments were performed as standard of care was available in the patient’s source notes. f. Bone scans were carried out at Baseline for all patients within 12 weeks prior to randomization in order to detect bony sites of disease. Bone scans performed before the signing of informed consent as routine procedures (but within 12 weeks before randomization) did not need to be repeated and could be used as Baseline assessments as long as (1) tests were performed using the method requirements outlined in RECIST 1.1 (2) the same technique/modality could be used to follow identified lesions throughout the study for a given patient (3) appropriate documentation indicating that these radiographic tumor assessments were performed as standard of care was available in the patient’s source notes. g. Bone scans were repeated during the active treatment phase when clinically indicated (ie, patient described new or worsening bone pain, or had increasing alkaline phosphatase level, or other signs and symptoms of new/progressing bone metastases) and were required to confirm disease response if bone lesions were identified at Baseline. h. Clinical assessment of superficial disease was to be carried out within the window of time for each assessment and was required to be recorded in the patient’s source document. A sample size of 630 patients (315 per treatment group) was estimated to provide approximately 85% power for achieving equivalence under the specified margin with 2.5% type I error rate assuming an ORR of 60% in both treatment groups. Considering a possible 10% attrition rate for patients reaching evaluation for ORR, a total sample size of approximately 690 patients (345 per treatment group) was required to be randomized to achieve the target sample size of 630. Overall, 707 patients were randomized to the double-blind treatment. Of these, 5 patients were randomized but did not receive study drug. Of the 702 treated patients, 127 had discontinued from the study at the time of the data cutoff (59 patients in the PF-05280014 group and 68 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group). A total of 17 patients (11 patients in the PF-05280014 group and 6 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) completed the study at the time of the data cutoff (including all follow-up as required according to the protocol). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Study participants had to be females over the age of 18 years with histologically confirmed HER2-overexpressing invasive breast cancer with the presence of metastatic disease. Patients were required to have at least 1 measurable lesion (outside prior radiation fields) as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and known ER status at study entry. Documentation of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression was required. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer were excluded from the study. Patients were excluded if they had received prior treatment, including systemic therapy for metastatic disease (except endocrine therapy), major surgery, or radiation. Study Treatment: Trastuzumab Regimen On treatment days when both trastuzumab and paclitaxel were administered, the order of administration according to study protocol was trastuzumab infusion, followed by paclitaxel infusion. During the period in which trastuzumab was administered in combination with paclitaxel, and until at least Week 33 of the study, trastuzumab was administered in a weekly regimen on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. The first administration on Cycle 1, Day 1, was a loading dose of 4 mg/kg infused over 90 minutes (which could be lengthened according to local standard of care or tolerability). Subsequent weekly infusions were 2 mg/kg administered over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability. Following completion of the paclitaxel administration period and beginning no earlier than Week 33 of the study, the trastuzumab regimen could be changed at the discretion of the investigator to every 3 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg infused over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability. No dose reductions were planned for trastuzumab. In the event of toxicity attributed to trastuzumab, treatment could be either temporarily or permanently discontinued. Following a temporary discontinuation, treatment was to resume with the administration of a loading required to be discontinued from the study drug phase of the study and moved into the long-term follow-up phase. Paclitaxel Regimen Paclitaxel was considered background therapy. To prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions, all patients were to receive premedication for paclitaxel administration in accordance with local paclitaxel product information and standard of care. Such premedication could consist of corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), diphenhydramine, and histamine antagonist. Paclitaxel was administered in a “weekly” regimen, on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (ie, no paclitaxel was administered on Day 22 of each cycle). The starting dose of paclitaxel was 80 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes; however, the duration of infusion could be altered according to local standard of care. In the absence of disease progression in the judgment of the investigator, or prohibitive toxicity, patients were to receive treatment with paclitaxel for at least 6 cycles or until maximal benefit of response was obtained. If toxicity occurred, proposed dose adjustments for paclitaxel by 1 level (70 mg/m2) and 2 levels (60 mg/m2) were provided as a guide to investigators. Additional measures could be taken as necessary per the investigator’s medical judgment. Missed dose(s) of paclitaxel were not to be made up. If paclitaxel dosing was held at any point, study procedures were required to proceed on schedule without any delay, including tumor assessments. Once the paclitaxel dose had been reduced for a patient, all subsequent cycles were required to be administered at the lower dose, unless further dose reduction was required. Dose re-escalation was not permitted. Patients were to be discontinued from paclitaxel if they required more than 2 dose reductions or if they had not recovered from a toxicity related to paclitaxel within 3 weeks. A complete blood count was required to be obtained prior to each paclitaxel dose. Absolute neutrophil count was required to have been ≥1000/mm3 (1.0 × 109/L) and platelet count was required to have been ≥75,000/mm3 (75 × 109/L) to administer paclitaxel. Administration of the next dose was held until recovery to these levels, but not more than 3 weeks. Liver function tests, including aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin were also required to be obtained prior to the start of each cycle of therapy. Patients requiring a delay in paclitaxel therapy due to hepatic toxicity were evaluated for possible progressive hepatic disease. Paclitaxel was also required to be discontinued for infusion reactions manifesting as anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by dyspnea or hypotension requiring treatment, angioedema, or generalized urticaria. Dose modifications for a patient experiencing acute hypersensitivity reaction despite premedication, neutropenia, liver function abnormalities, or severe peripheral neuropathy during paclitaxel therapy are provided in the dose adjustment guidelines below in Table 5. 80 mg/m , the -1 level of 70 mg/m , and the -2 level of 60 mg/m . Table 5. Paclitaxel Dose Adjustment Guidelines according to the investigator’s medical judgment. Abbreviations: ANC= absolute neutrophil count; G-CSF=granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was ORR defined as the percent of patients within each treatment group that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Week 25 of the study (window ±14 days) and confirmed on a follow-up assessment (Week 33 ±14 days), based on the assessments of the central radiology review in accordance with RECIST 1.1. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints • DOR: DOR was defined as the time from date of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of Progressive Disease (PD), or to death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, based on the assessments of the central radiology review in accordance with RECIST 1.1. • 1-Year PFS Rate: One (1)-year PFS rate was analyzed based on the time from date of randomization to first documentation of PD, or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, based on the assessments of the central radiology review in accordance with RECIST 1.1. • 1-Year Survival Rate: Time to death was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause while the patient was on the study. • Peak and trough PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU concentrations at selected cycles. Human serum samples were analyzed for concentrations of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU at Quest Pharmaceutical Services, using a validated, sensitive, and specific enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay. • Incidence of ADA, including NAb. Two sensitive, specific, and semi-quantitative electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassays, 1 for detecting antibodies against PF-05280014 and the other for detecting antibodies against trastuzumab, were used to analyze ADA samples. Human serum samples testing positive for the presence of ADA (anti-trastuzumab-EU and anti-PF-05280014) were analyzed for the presence or absence of neutralizing antibody (NAb [anti-trastuzumab-EU Nab and anti-PF-05280014 NAb]), whereas those samples tested negative for ADA were assigned NAb negative. Safety Evaluations: Safety was characterized by type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness, and relationship to study drug of adverse events (AEs), including cardiotoxicity, signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, infusion-related reactions (IRRs), and laboratory abnormalities. Hematology and blood chemistry tests were performed at protocol specified time points by local laboratories. Viral disease screening was performed at the Screening visit only by local laboratories to demonstrate eligibility, and was required only in countries where regulations considered only if a patient was at risk for having undiagnosed infection. In accordance with protocol Amendment 2, patients of childbearing potential were required to have a serum or urine pregnancy test at Screening, with sensitivity of at least 10 mIU/mL, within 1 week before study drug administration. A negative pregnancy result was required before the patient could receive the study drug. Pregnancy tests were also required whenever 1 menstrual cycle was missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy was otherwise suspected) on Day 1 of each cycle, and at the End of Treatment (EOT) visit to confirm the patient had not become pregnant during the study. Tumor HER2 status and tumor ER testing (for patients with unknown status) was also performed at Screening only. A physical examination including an examination of all major body systems was required at Screening and EOT visits only. During study drug treatment, symptom-directed physical examinations were performed. Vital signs assessed included weight, temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate. Statistical Methods: The hypothesis to be tested in this study was that the risk ratio of ORR of PF-05280014 versus that of trastuzumab-EU by Week 25 was within a pre-specified margin of 0.80 to 1.25. Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) for CR and PR were presented by treatment group and visit during the period when central radiology review tumor assessment data were available. The 95% CI of these response rates was constructed. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which was defined as all patients who were randomized to study drug. The ITT population was used as the primary analysis population. This population was used for patient accountability and all efficacy analyses. The primary efficacy analysis for equivalence was performed after all randomized patients had the opportunity to receive treatment through Week 25 and undergo assessment for confirmation of response. The estimated risk ratio in ORR between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was computed, and the asymptotic 95% CI of the risk ratio, as proposed by Miettinen and Nurminen, was constructed. The primary analysis was repeated with the additional stratification variables, to assess whether prior adjuvant trastuzumab exposure and/or ER status would affect the risk ratio of ORR between the 2 treatment groups. A descriptive summary table for CR and PR based on the investigator’s assessment was also provided. These analyses were performed using the ITT population. The secondary efficacy endpoints included DOR, 1-year PFS rate, and 1-year survival rate and were based on the assessments of the central radiology review using data collected up to covariates of interest. The models included treatment and the stratification factors at randomization. The hazard ratios and the 95% CI of the hazard ratios were presented. These analyses were primarily performed with the ITT population. As the study is ongoing, additional secondary endpoint data will be available after the data cutoff date for this public disclosure synopsis; thus some secondary analyses represent a subset of the final study data and may be repeated in subsequent Clinical Study Reports. Analyses were primarily conducted using central radiology assessments in accordance with RECIST 1.1. A concordance analysis of the tumor response data assessed by the central radiology vendor and the investigators was performed. A summary was provided to compare CR, PR, PD, Stable Disease, Not Done (or Not Assessed), Not Evaluable/Indeterminate between the 2 sources of assessment, presented by treatment group. The percentage of patients with positive ADA and NAb was summarized for each treatment using the Safety Population. For patients with positive ADA, the magnitude (titer), time of onset, and duration of ADA response based on available data was also described. The PK data summary and analyses were carried out using the PK population, defined as all patients who were treated with PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU, had no major protocol deviations that influenced the PK assessments, and had at least 1 post-dose concentration measurement. The concentration-time data were summarized descriptively by treatment group. A listing of all concentrations sorted by treatment, patient number and nominal time post dose was generated. The concentration listing also included the actual sampling times. Deviations from the nominal time were provided in a separate listing. The safety analyses were carried out using the Safety Population, defined as all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Population was used for the safety analyses including ADA and NAb analyses. Patient listings were produced for all safety endpoints. The following safety endpoints were summarized descriptively: • Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), treatment-related AEs (ie, related to trastuzumab and/or paclitaxel), trastuzumab-related AEs (ie, related to trastuzumab only), and serious adverse events (SAEs) (signs and symptoms of IRRs are presented separately); • Signs and symptoms of IRRs. These are summarized separately from the TEAEs and not included in the overall TEAE summaries. Note, the TEAE for IRR as recorded by the investigator and coded as Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Term (PT), IRR is included in the TEAE overall summaries; • Withdrawals from active treatment due to AEs; • Electrocardiogram (ECG); • Echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA). RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: There were 707 patients randomized to the double-blind treatment (Table 6). Of these, 5 patients were randomized but did not receive study drug. Of the 702 treated patients, 144 patients were discontinued from the study or had completed the study at the time of the data cutoff and 558 patients remained ongoing in the study at the data cutoff date, with a comparable percentage in each treatment group. All randomized patients (n=707) were included in the ITT population. For the Safety Population, 702 patients (349 patients in the PF-05280014 group and 353 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) were included. Table 6.

Abbreviations: eCRF=electronic Case Report Form; EU=European Union; ITT=intent-to-treat; PK=pharmacokinetic; PP=per protocol. There were 132 (18.7%) patients who discontinued from the study (62 [17.6%] patients and 38 [10.7%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively). Table 7.

Status at time of data cutoff (collection date within [365 + 14 – 1] days post-randomization, ie, 378 days post the date of randomization). A total of 338 (47.8%) patients discontinued trastuzumab treatment; 165 (46.9%) patients in the PF-05280014 group, and 173 (48.7%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group. The primary reason for discontinuation of trastuzumab in both treatment groups was objective disease progression or relapse (Table 8). Patients discontinued from trastuzumab were also required to discontinue paclitaxel. The number of patients discontinued from paclitaxel was lower than the number discontinued from trastuzumab in Table 8, because some patients completed treatment with paclitaxel before discontinuation of trastuzumab. There were 287 (40.6%) patients who discontinued from paclitaxel treatment (147 [41.8%] in the PF-05280014 group and 140 [39.4%] in the trastuzumab-EU group). A patient’s primary reason for discontinuation could be counted in both the trastuzumab and the paclitaxel categories. Table 8.

For all patients, with the exception of those from Hungary, age was calculated as [Date of Informed Consent-Date of Birth]/365.25. For Hungarian patients, as only the year of birth was reported, age was calculated as Year of Informed Consent - Year of Birth. All patients randomized (n=707) had a diagnosis of breast cancer. Characteristics of breast cancer were comparable across treatment groups; the most frequently reported histology classification was ductal (278 [79.0] and 277 [78.0] patients for the PF-05280014 and the trastuzumab-EU group, respectively), and the mean (SD) duration since diagnosis of breast cancer was 23.6 (34.02) months, with a range of 0 to 284 months. Efficacy, Immunogenicity, and Pharmacokinetic Results: Primary Efficacy Endpoint Similarity between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was statistically demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint. The analysis of ORR derived from central radiology assessments showed a risk ratio of 0.940 (PF-05280014 over trastuzumab-EU), with a 95% CI of (0.842, 1.049), which fell entirely within the 0.80 to 1.25 equivalence margin (Table 13).

Risk Ratio and associated 95% CI were based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 1-Year Progression-Free Survival Rate The median time to PFS and the percentage of patients who progressed/died or were censored were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. Using all available data in the data snapshot up to 1-year post randomization, there were 121 (34.4%) and 120 (33.8%) patients who had disease progression or had died in the PF-05280014 group and (231 [65.6%] patients in the PF-05280014 and 235 [66.2%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU treatment groups) were censored. The median time to PFS was 12.16 months in the PF-05280014 group and 12.22 months in the trastuzumab-EU group. Using a Cox Proportional Hazards model with prior trastuzumab exposure (Yes/No) and ER status (ER positive versus ER negative) as strata, the hazard ratio when comparing PFS between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was 1.07, with a 95% CI of (0.83, 1.37). The stratified log-rank test resulted in a 1-sided p-value of 0.691. Table 14.

Duration of Response The percentage of all patients who achieved confirmed response (CR or PR, with or without subsequent progression or death) was comparable between the 2 treatment groups (223 [63.4%] patients in the PF-05280014 group compared with 238 [67.0%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group). There were 166 (74.4%) and 180 (75.6%) patients who had confirmed response without subsequent progression or death up to Week 53 in the follow-up), and was observed as 10.61 months in the trastuzumab-EU group. Using a Cox Proportional Hazards model with prior trastuzumab exposure (Yes/No) and ER status (ER positive versus ER negative) as strata, the hazard ratio when comparing DOR between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was 1.08, with 95% CI of (0.75, 1.56).

The percentage of patients who died was comparable across the 2 treatment groups. There were 39 (11.1%) and 38 (10.7%) patients who died in the PF-05280014 group and the trastuzumab-EU group, respectively (up to 378 days post-randomization); (Table 16). The median time to death could not be estimated in either treatment group due to the small proportion of deaths observed. Using a Cox Proportional Hazards model with prior trastuzumab exposure (Yes/No) and ER status (ER positive versus ER negative) as strata, the hazard ratio when comparing OS between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab EU, was 1.048, with 95% CI of (0.669, 1.642).

For PK assessments, all available samples up to Cycle 17, Day 1, with the exception of EOT visit and unplanned samples were included in this data snapshot. All the EOT or unplanned sample results will be presented in a subsequent study report. For some patients Cycle 17, Day 1 was beyond 1-year post randomization (Week 53 assessment) due to the option to change to a 3-weekly dosing regimen for trastuzumab post Week 33. A summary of serum concentrations of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU versus time is provided for patients in the PK population in Table 17. Mean concentrations were comparable across the 2 treatment groups for all time points measured from Baseline (defined as Cycle 1, Day 1) through Cycle 5, Day 8. From Cycle 7, Day 1 through Cycle 17, patients could be on different treatment regimens (2 mg/kg administered weekly, or 6 mg/kg administered every 3 weeks). This is due to the protocol allowance for a regimen switch after Cycle 5 (applicable in a few subjects) or starting at Cycle 9, Day 1. Therefore, comparisons of summary statistics of serum concentrations of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU after Cycle 7, Day 1 across or within the treatment groups could be confounded by the different treatment regimens and not described.

Summaries of ADA and NAb incidences for patients in the Safety Population are provided in Table 18. For immunology assessments, all available samples up to Cycle 17, Day 1, with the exception of EOT visit and unplanned samples were included in this data snapshot. All the EOT or unplanned sample results will be presented in a subsequent study report. Cycle 17, Day 1 occurred beyond 1-year post randomization (Week 53 assessment) for some patients because of the optional change to a 3-weekly dosing regimen for trastuzumab post Week 33. For patients in the Safety Population, there were 30 (8.6%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 14 (4.0%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group who had a positive ADA test (titer ≥1.00) at Baseline, prior to initiation of study drug (Cycle 1, Day 1, Table 18). The highest titer was 2.62 in the PF-05280014 group and 2.39 in the trastuzumab-EU group. Following initiation of study drug, all patients with the exception of 1 patient in the trastuzumab-EU group tested negative for ADA (titer <1.00) from Cycle 1, Day 1 through Cycle 17, Day 1. This patient tested positive for a low titer (1.00) of ADA at Cycle 17, Day 1. The patient had Stable Disease (as assessed by the investigator) throughout the data cutoff point (Week 53), had no IRRs, and had PK trough concentration at Cycle 17, Day 1 within the range of observed Cycle 17, Day 1 concentrations in the group. NAb sample analysis was only conducted for those study samples that tested positive for ADA whereas samples reported negative for ADA were assigned to be NAb negative. At Baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) currently there were 26 patients in the PF-05280014 group and 13 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group with a sample analyzed for NAb. A positive NAb test (titer ≥1.48) was reported for 16 patients (4.6%) in the PF-05280014 group and 8 patients (2.3%) in the trastuzumab-EU group at Baseline. The ADA-positive sample at Cycle 17, Day 1 from the 1 patient will be analyzed for Nab and the result will be presented in a subsequent report.

For the Overall rows, n=number of patients tested for at least one sample post Cycle 1 Day 1 dose during the specified period; patients with a positive ADA status at any time post Cycle 1 Day 1 dose during the specified period is defined as having an overall positive ADA status for the period; while patients with none of the samples tested positive post Cycle 1 Day 1 dose during the specified period is defined as having an overall negative ADA status for the period. Abbreviations: ADA=anti-drug antibodies; NAb=neutralizing antibodies. A summary of SAEs is provided in Table 19. There were 51 (14.61%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 54 (15.30%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group who experienced at least 1 SAE. The most common SAE in both groups was disease progression (12 [3.44%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 12 [3.40%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group). Table 19.

Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation and Completion Dates: First Subject First Visit: 24 February 2014 Data cutoff date (Week 33 Analysis): 24 August 2016 Data cutoff date (Week 53 Analysis): 11 January 2017 Data snapshot date (Week 53 Analysis): 17 February 2017 Report Date: 21 July 2017 Previous Report Date(s): 16 February 2017 (Week 33 Analysis, administrative update on 19 April 2017) Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objective(s): The primary objective was to compare the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer who received PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel to those who received trastuzumab-European Union (EU) in combination with paclitaxel. Secondary objectives included:  To evaluate the safety of PF-05280014 plus paclitaxel versus trastuzumab-EU plus paclitaxel;  To evaluate secondary measures of tumor control;  To evaluate the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU;  To evaluate the immunogenicity of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU. METHODS Study Design: This was an international, double-blind, randomized, Phase 3 clinical study evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK and immunogenicity of PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel versus trastuzumab-EU with paclitaxel in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in the first-line treatment setting. The primary endpoint was ORR, evaluating responses achieved by Week 25 (and subsequently confirmed at Week 33, in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST Version 1.1]). Central radiology review was the basis for the primary analysis. Secondary endpoints included safety, 1-year progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), 1-year survival rate, selected peak and trough drug concentrations, and immunogenicity. The hypothesis to be tested in this study was that the risk ratio of ORR of PF-05280014 versus that of trastuzumab-EU by Week 25 (and subsequently confirmed at Week 33) was within a pre-specified margin of 0.80 to 1.25. A sample size of 630 patients (315 per treatment arm) was estimated to provide approximately 85% power for achieving equivalence under the specified margin with 2.5% Type I error rate, assuming an ORR of 60% in both treatment arms. Considering a possible 10% attrition rate for patients reaching evaluation for ORR, a total sample size of approximately 690 patients (345 per treatment arm) was required to be randomized to achieve the target sample size of 630. Tumor tissue blocks or unstained slides were required to be collected and sent to the sponsor-provided central laboratory for all patients for standardized, retrospective evaluation of HER2 status. The primary analysis for study outcome was based on all patients irrespective of HER2 status, as documented at the time of randomization. Patients found to have a negative HER2 status by retrospective central evaluation were excluded from the per protocol (PP) population. Patients were randomized (1:1) using an automated interactive web based response system to receive PF-05280014 plus paclitaxel or trastuzumab-EU plus paclitaxel. Randomization was stratified by:  Prior trastuzumab exposure (Yes/No);  Estrogen receptor (ER) status (ER positive versus ER negative). The treatment approach balanced the need for consistent study drug through the evaluation period for the primary efficacy endpoint (Week 25 assessment for ORR with provision for confirmation of response at Week 33) while allowing use of a less frequent treatment schedule after completion of the primary efficacy endpoint. Dose reductions for trastuzumab were not permitted in accordance with the protocol. Treatment with trastuzumab could continue until objective disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1 in the judgment of the investigator. Patients experiencing disease progression were expected to discontinue study drug and begin the long-term follow-up (LTFU) phase of the study. Patients were required to have at least 1 measurable lesion (outside prior radiation fields) as defined by RECIST 1.1. Independent central radiology review was required to confirm presence of measurable disease prior to randomization, and for all subsequent disease assessments. The following kinds of lesions were not measurable according to RECIST 1.1: ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, osteoblastic or osteolytic bone metastases, and carcinomatous lymphangitis of the lung. For patients assessed by the central radiology review to have achieved an objective disease response as defined in the primary endpoint (ie, by Week 25 and subsequently confirmed by Week 33), central review continued up to Week 53 assessments to characterize DOR. Analyses of the primary endpoint ORR achieved by Week 25 (subsequently confirmed by Week 33) and the secondary endpoint of DOR were based on assessments of the central radiology review. Serum samples for determination of trough (pre-dose) and peak (1-hour post-dose) drug concentrations were collected for selected doses in this study. The concentration-time data was used for the population PK analysis using a nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach. The PK modeling and analysis is reported separately. Safety data were reviewed throughout the study in a blinded manner by the study team and in an unblinded manner by an external Data Monitoring Committee.  The primary efficacy analysis (as reported in a previous CSR, dated 16 February 2017), for which all available central radiology data as of the cutoff date of 24 August 2016, when all patients had either completed the Week 33 tumor assessment or discontinued study drug earlier than the Week 33 visit. All patients had data available for the primary analysis. The data snapshot for the primary analysis was taken on 12 Oct 2016.  The primary efficacy analysis at Week 33 was reproduced on all available central radiology data as of the cutoff date of 11 January 2017.  All secondary analyses (including efficacy, safety, PK, immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics ([serum HER2]), for which all clinical data up to 378 days post-randomization (ie, randomization date + 365 + 14 day window -1), as of the cutoff date of 11 January 2017. All patients had data up to and including Week 53 for the secondary analyses. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Female patients aged 18 years or older with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer and presence of metastatic disease were eligible for inclusion in the study. Documentation of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression, ER status (positive or negative) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0 to 2 was also required for study eligibility. Tumor tissue for central review of HER2 status and at least 1 measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1 were required attributes. Recovery (Grade 1 or Baseline) from all clinically significant adverse effects from prior therapies (excluding alopecia) was required. With the exception of endocrine therapy, prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease was not permitted. In addition, all Screening laboratory values were to be within specified limits and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was required to be within institutional range of normal as measured by either a 2-dimensional echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA). Study Treatment: Trastuzumab (PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU) was administered in a weekly regimen on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle. The first administration on Cycle 1, Day 1, was a loading dose of 4 mg/kg infused over 90 minutes. Subsequent weekly infusions were 2 mg/kg administered over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability. Following completion of the paclitaxel administration period and beginning no earlier than Week 33 of the study, the trastuzumab regimen could be changed at the discretion of the investigator to every 3 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg infused over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability. Dose reductions for trastuzumab were not permitted. Paclitaxel was administered on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (ie, no paclitaxel was administered on Day 22 of each cycle). The starting dose of paclitaxel was 80 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes; however the duration of infusion could be altered provision was made for dose reduction to 70 mg/m2 and then 60 mg/m2 as needed. In the absence of disease progression in the judgment of the investigator or prohibitive toxicity, patients received treatment with paclitaxel for at least 6 cycles or until maximal benefit of response was obtained. On treatment days when both trastuzumab and paclitaxel were administered, the order of administration recommended per study protocol, was trastuzumab infusion followed by paclitaxel infusion.

Efficacy Evaluations: The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR defined as the percent of patients within each treatment group that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Week 25 of the study (window  14 days) and confirmed on a follow-up assessment (Week 33  14 days) or early discontinuation, in accordance with RECIST 1.1. Secondary efficacy evaluations included:  1-year PFS rate, analyzed based on the time from date of randomization to first documentation of progressive disease (PD), or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD;  DOR (defined as the time from date of the first documentation of objective tumor response [CR or PR] to the first documentation of PD, or to death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD);  1-year survival rate where time to death was defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause while the patient was on the study. Other evaluations included immunogenicity endpoints (anti-drug antibodies [ADA] and neutralizing antibodies [NAb] based on human serum samples), and concordance for tumor HER2 status (investigator assessment versus central review). Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Evaluations: The PK of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU was determined using serum samples collected at Cycle 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and subsequently every 3 cycles until the End of Treatment visit (EOT; 28 days post last study drug administration). Samples were collected pre-dose at each scheduled cycle (Week 1, Day 1). Additional samples were collected during Cycle 1 and Cycle 5 only, at 1 hour post end of infusion (Week 1, Day 1) and pre-dose at Week 2, Day 8. Samples were analyzed for concentrations of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU using a validated, sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). There was no calculation of PK parameters for this study. The serum concentration-time data was summarized using descriptive statistics. Blood samples for assessment of ADA and NAb were collected at Cycle 1, 3, 5, 8 and subsequently every 3 cycles until EOT. All samples were analyzed by a designated analytical laboratory using validated analytical methods in compliance with Standard Operating Procedures. The serum specimens were stored at approximately -70C until assay. Two (2) sensitive, specific, and semi-quantitative electrochemiluminescent immunoassays, 1 for detecting antibodies against PF-05280014 and 1 for detecting antibodies against trastuzumab, were used to analyze ADA samples. For patients who received any trastuzumab-containing product after discontinuation of study drug, every effort was made to collect samples for ADA/NAb and drug concentration prior to beginning treatment with the subsequent trastuzumab product, and again between 2 and 4 months after the start of the subsequent therapy. Human serum samples testing positive for the presence of ADA (anti-trastuzumab-EU and anti-PF-05280014) were required to be analyzed for the presence or absence of NAb (neutralizing anti-trastuzumab-EU and neutralizing anti-PF-05280014 antibodies). Human serum samples were collected pre-dose at Cycle 1 (Week 1 Day 1, and Week 2 Day 8), 3, 5, 8, and EOT (28 days post last study drug administration), and analyzed for HER2 concentrations using a HER2 ELISA development kit. The serum HER2 concentration-time data was summarized by descriptive statistics, and the percent change from individual Baseline at each sampling point was calculated for each patient. Safety Evaluations: Safety was characterized by type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness, and relationship to study drug of adverse events (AEs), including cardiotoxicity and infusion related reactions (IRRs), and laboratory abnormalities. In addition, vital signs (including heart rate, blood pressure), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and LVEF assessments (by ECHO or MUGA) were performed. Statistical Methods: The primary efficacy analysis for equivalence was performed after all randomized patients had the opportunity to receive treatment through Week 25 and undergo assessment for confirmation of response by Week 33. The estimated risk ratio in ORR between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population was computed, and the asymptotic 95% confidence interval (CI) of the ratio was constructed. The primary analysis was repeated with the additional stratification variables, to assess whether prior adjuvant trastuzumab exposure and/or ER status would affect the risk ratio of ORR between the 2 treatment groups. As a sensitivity analysis, the method was repeated using the PP population. The secondary efficacy time-to-event endpoints of 1-year PFS rate and DOR were based on the assessments of the central radiology review using data collected up to 378 days post-randomization. A Cox proportional hazard model, using the ITT population, was used to assess covariates of interest. The models used treatment and the stratification factors at randomization. The hazard ratios and the 95% CI of the hazard ratios were presented. As a confirmatory analysis, these analyses were repeated with the PP population. A concordance analysis of the tumor response data assessed by the 2 methods (central radiology vendor and the investigator assessment) was performed for the ITT population, and presented descriptively for each scheduled visit. The percentage of patients with positive ADA and NAb was summarized for each treatment group using the safety population. Safety data were described using descriptive statistics. A 95% CI of the risk difference for patients with Tier-1 and Tier-2 AEs (those identified by the medical team to be of special interest, and those occurring in 5% patients in at least 1 treatment group) was calculated. Signs and symptoms of IRR were defined as such by the investigator on the electronic Case Report Form, in addition to the investigator recording a separate AE of IRR. Signs and symptoms of IRR were required to be collected only for those events related to trastuzumab and were reported separately from the AEs. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: There were 707 patients randomized to the double-blind treatment (Table S2). Of these, 5 patients were randomized but did not receive study drug; 3 patients in the PF-05280014 group (1 patient was withdrawn by the investigator following diagnosis of leucoerythroblastic syndrome, 1 patient had thrombocytopenia, and 1 patient was found to not meet study criteria at Cycle 1, Day 1 based on further review of chemistry tests), and 2 patients in the trastuzumab-EU group (1 patient was no longer willing to participate and 1 patient was found not to meet study criteria based on HER2 status). There were 336 (47.5%) patients who were still actively being treated with trastuzumab at the time of the data cutoff, with a comparable percentage in each treatment group (171 [48.6%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 165 [46.5%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group). The remaining 371 (52.5%) patients had discontinued trastuzumab treatment at the time of the data cutoff; 181 (51.4%) patients in the PF-05280014 group, and 190 (53.5%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group. Overall, 281 (39.7%) patients were discontinued from treatment due to progression or relapse and 90 (12.7%) patients were discontinued from treatment prior to progression or relapse. At the time of the data cutoff, there were 200 (28.3%) patients no longer receiving trastuzumab but remaining in the LTFU phase of the study. There were 536 (75.8%) patients who remained ongoing in the study at the data cutoff date, with a comparable percentage in each treatment group. Overall, 166 patients were discontinued from the study or had completed the study at the time of the data cutoff. A total of 32 (4.5%) patients (20 [5.7%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 12 [3.4%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) had completed the study at the time of the data cutoff (including all follow-up as required according to the protocol), 42 (5.9%) patients discontinued the study prior to LTFU (ie, never entered LTFU: 18 [5.1%] patients on PF-05280014 and 24 [6.8%] patients on trastuzumab-EU), and 92 (13.0%) patients discontinued during LTFU; 43 (12.2%) patients on PF-05280014 and 49 (13.8%) patients on trastuzumab-EU. The ITT population (707 [100%] patients) was used for the efficacy analysis and the safety population was used for the analyses of AEs (702 [99.3%] patients) and laboratory data (699 [98.9%] patients), including ADA and NAb analyses. The PP population (565 [79.9%] patients) was used for sensitivity analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy and biomarker endpoints. The PK population (702 [99.3%] patients) was used for analysis of the PK endpoints. The proportion of patients in each population was comparable across treatment groups. Demographic and Baseline characteristics were comparable across the 2 treatment groups. Table S2.

Efficacy Results:  The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, ORR, demonstrated similarity between the 2 treatment groups. This result was determined in the previous CSR (data cutoff on 24 August 2016). The risk ratio was 0.940 (PF-05280014 over trastuzumab-EU) with a 95% CI of (0.842, 1.049), which fell within the pre-specified equivalence margin of 0.80 to 1.25.  Following the most recent data cutoff on 11 January 2017, and new information that resulted in updates to the central radiology assessments, the primary efficacy endpoint was re-analyzed, yielding results that were consistent with the previous CSR.  The secondary endpoint results for 1-year PFS rate, DOR, and 1-year survival rate were also comparable between the 2 treatment groups, in the ITT population:  The 1-year (95% CI) PFS rate was 54% (48%, 60%) compared with 51% (45%, 57%), with a median (95% CI]) time to PFS of 12.16 (11.93, 12.48) months and 12.06 (11.79, not estimable) months for the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively.  The 9-month (95% CI) DOR rate was 71% (64%, 76%) compared with 68% (61%, 74%), with a median (95% CI) DOR of 11.27 (10.41, 11.27) months and 10.58 (10.22, not estimable) months for the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively.  The median time to death was not estimable due to too few deaths. The 1-year (95% CI) survival rate was 89.31% (85.48%, 92.17%) compared with 87.36% (83.27%, 90.51%) for the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively.  There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment groups for any of these secondary endpoints. Sensitivity analyses in the PP population supported these results. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, Immunogenicity and/or Other Results:  Mean serum concentrations of PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU were comparable across the 2 treatment groups at respective time points from Baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) through Cycle 5, Day 8.  The percent change from Baseline in serum HER2 results was comparable for the 2 treatment groups at respective time points through Cycle 8.  The observed rate of immunogenicity was low, with comparable treatment-emergent immunogenicity observed for the 2 treatment groups. Treatment-emergent ADA or NAb were not associated with IRRs. Safety Results:  The incidence for all categories of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious TEAEs was comparable across the 2 treatment groups.  The percentage of patients who died was comparable in both treatment groups. Of the total of 85 deaths, the majority were due to the disease under study (70 [10.0%] patients, with 38 [10.9%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 32 [9.1%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group).  The percentage of patients reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) was comparable in both treatment groups. Overall, there were 70 (20.1%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 73 (20.7%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group who experienced at least 1 SAE. The most frequently reported SAE was disease progression with a comparable incidence in both groups.  There were no statistically significant differences in the incidences of any of the events of special interest (Tier-1) between the 2 treatment groups, including IRRs and cardiac disorders.  There were no clinically significant differences in laboratory values between the 2 treatment groups.  No clinically significant differences were observed for ECGs or LVEF between the 2 treatment groups. Conclusion(s):  The study met its primary objective.  The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, ORR, demonstrated similarity between the 2 treatment groups as presented in the previous CSR (data cutoff on 24 August 2016). The risk ratio was 0.940 (PF-05280014 over trastuzumab-EU) with a 95% CI of (0.842, 1.049), which fell within the pre-specified equivalence margin of 0.80 to 1.25.  A reanalysis of the ORR endpoint incorporating new information that resulted in updates to the central radiology assessments, for the data cutoff of 11 January 2017, provided results that were consistent with the primary analysis from the previous CSR.  No statistically significant differences were observed for the secondary efficacy  Both treatments showed a comparable safety profile.  The PK results in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups were also comparable.  The observed rate of immunogenicity was low, with comparable treatment-emergent immunogenicity observed for the 2 treatment groups. Treatment-emergent ADA was not associated with IRR.

The IRBs and IECs are listed in Appendix 16.1.3.1. Ethical Conduct of the Study This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Patients (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 and 2008), and in compliance with International Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines 1996. In addition, all local regulatory requirements were followed, in particular those affording greater protection to the safety of trial participants. INTRODUCTION PF-05280014 has been developed as a biosimilar to Herceptin® (trastuzumab). Similar to Herceptin, PF-05280014 is a recombinant humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab is approved for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and gastric cancer. Results at Week 33 and Week 53 have been reported in 2 previous clinical study reports (CSRs). The Week 33 CSR (dated 16 February 2017) presented the data as of the cutoff date of 24 August 2016, when all patients had either completed the Week 33 tumor assessment (for the primary efficacy analysis) or discontinued study drug earlier than the Week 33 visit, and included data for up to 378 days post-randomization for some patients. The Week 53 CSR (dated 21 July 2017) presented data from the study with a cutoff date of 11 January 2017 when all patients had either completed the Week 53 tumor assessment or discontinued study drug earlier than the Week 53 visit. After the data cutoff for the Week 53 analysis, the study protocol was amended to delineate 2 treatment periods (Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2). The study elements required to achieve study objectives and endpoints (ie, through Week 53 visit assessments) (Table 1) were contained within Treatment Period 1. Treatment Period 2 was intended solely to provide access to study treatment for patients who continued to receive clinical benefit beyond Treatment Period 1, with limited protocol-required assessments. The results reported in this synopsis study report are limited to a summary of the study population, treatment exposure, cumulative safety (adverse events [AEs], left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]) and overall survival (OS). Table 1. Study Objectives and Endpoints Type Objective Endpoint PrimaryEfficacy To compare the objective ORR, evaluating responses response rate (ORR) in patients achieved by Week 25 and with metastatic human epidermal subsequently confirmed, based on growth factor receptor 2 the assessments of the central (HER2)-positive breast cancer radiology review in accordance who received PF-05280014 to with Response Evaluation Criteria those who received In Solid Tumors, version 1.1 trastuzumab-EU, each in (RECIST 1.1) combination with paclitaxel SecondarySafety To evaluate the safety of Safety characterized by type, PF-05280014 plus paclitaxel incidence, severity, timing, versus trastuzumab-EU plus seriousness, and relationship to paclitaxel study therapy of AEs, including cardiotoxicity and infusion related reactions, and laboratory abnormalities Efficacy To evaluate secondary measures Duration of response (DOR), of tumor control 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate and 1-year survival rate Pharmacokinetic (PK) To evaluate the population PK of Peak and trough PF-05280014 and PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU concentrations at trastuzumab-EU selected cycles Immunogenicity To evaluate the immunogenicity Incidence of anti-trastuzumab of PF-05280014 and antibodies, including neutralizing trastuzumab-EU antibodies INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN Study Design Refer to Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 3 for the study design. This was an international, double-blind, randomized, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK and immunogenicity of PF-05280014 in combination with paclitaxel versus trastuzumab-EU with paclitaxel in patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer in the first-line treatment setting. The primary endpoint was ORR, evaluating responses achieved by Week 25 (and subsequently confirmed at Week 33), in accordance with RECIST 1.1. The hypothesis tested was that the risk ratio of ORR of PF-05280014 versus that of trastuzumab-EU by Week 25 (and subsequently confirmed by Week 33) was within a pre-specified margin of 0.80 to 1.25. Patients were randomized (1:1) to either PF-05280014 plus paclitaxel or trastuzumab-EU plus paclitaxel. Randomization was stratified by prior trastuzumab exposure (yes versus no), and estrogen receptor (ER) status (ER positive versus ER negative). delineate 2 treatment periods (Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2). Treatment Period 1 for a patient began with the first dose of study treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1 and ended with the completion of the Week 53 visit assessments and upon providing written, signed and dated informed consent for protocol amendment 4. Efficacy and safety assessments and procedures were undertaken as described in Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Schedule of Activities, Flowcharts 1 to 4. Patients were treated in a blinded manner with the same trastuzumab product to which they were randomized (PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU) throughout Treatment Period 1. Treatment Period 2 for a patient began upon providing written, signed and dated informed consent for protocol amendment 4. Patients receiving study treatment beyond Week 53 at the time of amendment 4 approval were consented for and entered Treatment Period 2 as soon as possible and no later than 28 days following approval. Minimal required assessments and procedures were undertaken as described in Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Schedule of Activities, Flowcharts 3 to 4. All other routine patient care assessments were at the discretion of the investigator based on local practice/standard of care (SoC). It was the responsibility of the investigator to perform tests and procedures necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the patient. Continued treatment in the study was based on documented evidence of clinical benefit provided to the Sponsor at regular intervals as determined by local SoC disease assessment frequency. Patients were treated in a blinded manner with the same trastuzumab product to which they were initially randomized (PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU) until discontinuation from treatment. A decision was made by the Sponsor to end the study following receipt of PF-05280014 marketing authorization approvals in several countries globally. Patients who continued to show clinical benefit were transferred to access programs as per regional regulations. The last dose of study treatment was administered on 30 May 2020. Selection of Study Population Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Key inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. For a full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, refer to Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Sections 4.1 and 4.2. Key inclusion criteria:  Female, aged 18 years or older.  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer.  Presence of metastatic disease.  Documentation of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression by one of the following: hybridization (CISH), or dual in-situ hybridization (DISH) (as defined by the manufacturer’s kit instruction); OR b. Overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) categorized as IHC3+; OR c. Overexpression by IHC categorized as IHC2+ with FISH, CISH, or DISH confirmation.  Available tumor tissue (ie, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks or unstained slides) for central review of HER2 status. Tumor tissue should have been from metastatic disease or, if not obtainable, could have been from the primary tumor at the time of initial or current diagnosis.  At least 1 measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1; measurable lesions must have been outside prior radiation fields. The following kinds of lesions were not measurable according to RECIST 1.1: ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, osteoblastic or osteolytic bone metastases, and carcinomatous lymphangitis of the lung. The site must have forwarded the radiographs to the independent central review laboratory to obtain confirmation of the presence of measurable disease prior to patient randomization.  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0 to 2.  LVEF within institutional range of normal, measured by either 2-dimensional echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA). Key exclusion criteria:  Relapse within 1 year of last dose of previous adjuvant (including neoadjuvant) treatment (except endocrine therapy) and within 1 year before randomization.  Prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease (except endocrine therapy).  Prior cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 400 mg/m2, epirubicin dose 800 mg/m2, or the equivalent dose for other anthracyclines or derivatives (eg, 72 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone). If the patient had received more than one anthracycline, then the cumulative dose must not have exceeded the equivalent of 400 mg/m2 of doxorubicin.  Inflammatory breast cancer.  Active or uncontrolled symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases, as evidenced by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth. Patients with a history of CNS metastases or cord compression were eligible if they had completed definitive treatment and had not received anticonvulsants or steroids for at least 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Patients with newly detected asymptomatic CNS metastases must have completed definitive treatment with a history of carcinomatous meningitis (leptomeningeal disease) were not eligible. Treatments Refer to Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 5 for details of study treatments. Trastuzumab (PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU) was provided as blinded supplies of lyophilized sterile powder in single-use vials nominally containing 150 mg trastuzumab. Vials were reconstituted with sterile water for injection and further diluted in an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride, for intravenous infusion. During the period in which trastuzumab was administered in combination with paclitaxel, and until at least Week 33 of the study, trastuzumab was administered in a weekly regimen on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. The first administration on Day 1, Cycle 1 was a loading dose of 4 mg/kg infused over 90 minutes and subsequent weekly infusions were 2 mg/kg administered over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability. Following completion of the paclitaxel administration period and beginning no earlier than Week 33, the trastuzumab regimen may have been changed at the discretion of the investigator to every 3 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg administered over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability. Study treatment with trastuzumab continued until objective disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1 in the judgment of the investigator or until the patient completed all Week 53 visit assessments (ie, end of Treatment Period 1), whichever occurred first. Paclitaxel was considered background therapy. Paclitaxel was the branded or generic product available at the local region and was administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The starting dose was 80 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes, however the duration of the infusion may have been altered according to local SoC, and provision was made for dose reduction to 70 mg/m2 and then 60 mg/m2 as needed. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in the judgment of the investigator, patients received treatment with paclitaxel for at least 6 cycles, until maximal benefit of response was obtained, or until the patient completed all Week 53 visit assessments (ie, end of Treatment Period 1), whichever occurred first. Patients continuing to derive benefit from study treatment after completing Treatment Period 1 began Treatment Period 2, during which all patients continued to receive PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU (administered as monotherapy) in a blinded manner. The dosing regimen was every 3 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg infused over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability. Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Safety, and Immunogenicity Evaluations Efficacy Evaluations Efficacy evaluations are as described in Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 7.1. During Treatment Period 2, tumor assessments were performed according to local SoC disease assessment frequency. A minimum interval of 4 months was recommended. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic (PD), and immunogenicity evaluations performed during Treatment Period 1 are as described in Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 7.3, Protocol Section 7.4, and Protocol Section 7.6, respectively. These evaluations were not performed during Treatment Period 2. Safety Evaluations Safety evaluations are as described in Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 7.2. During Treatment Period 2, AEs and concomitant medications were monitored continuously. MUGA or ECHO were performed according to local SoC. Statistical Methods Planned in the Protocol and Determination of Sample Size Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses is documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP; Appendix 16.1.9.1). The determination of sample size is provided in Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 9.1. The following analyses were performed on the final dataset for this CSR. All other analyses previously performed on earlier data cuts are summarized in the previous CSRs. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to obtain estimates of survival rate at 1, 2 and 3 years post-randomization. A 1-sided log-rank test was used to compare the survival distribution between the 2 treatments. The time to discontinuation from trastuzumab was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the median time on treatment, as well as the probability of still receiving trastuzumab at Months 6, 9 and 12 after randomization. A 1-sided log-rank test was used to compare the curves representing the probability of remaining on treatment between the 2 treatment groups. All patients treated with at least 1 dose of study treatment (trastuzumab or paclitaxel) were included in the safety analysis. Data summaries were presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate. Details of planned analyses were described in the SAP (Appendix 16.1.9.1). Adverse events were classified using the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) classification system, version 23.0. The severity of AEs was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as any AE that occurred, or any pre-existing AE that worsened, after beginning study treatment through 70 days after the last dose of study treatment. Whether AEs were related to the study treatment was determined by the investigator. Treatment-emergent AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) were summarized by body system and Preferred Term (PT) according to MedDRA terminology. Adverse events leading to death or events: anaphylactic reaction, cardiac failure, ejection fraction decreased, infusion related reaction, pyrexia, chills, pruritus, dyspnoea, interstitial lung disease, and left ventricular dysfunction) were summarized. Summaries of patients with an absolute decline in LVEF ≥16% from baseline and an absolute decline in LVEF of ≥10% from baseline and below the lower limit of normal (LLN) were provided by visit. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Data Sets Analyzed A total of 707 patients were randomized. Of these, 5 (0.7%) patients were randomized but did not receive any study drug (Table 2). Seven hundred and seven (707 [100.0%]) patients were analyzed for efficacy (intent-to-treat [ITT] population). For safety, 702 (99.3%) patients were analyzed for AEs, and 699 (98.9%) patients were analyzed for laboratory data (Table 2). A listing of patient evaluation groups by patient is provided in Appendix 16.2.1.1. Seven hundred and seven (707 [100.0%]) patients discontinued trastuzumab treatment (including the 5 patients who did not receive any study drug): 503 (71.1%) patients due to objective progression or relapse. Three hundred and thirty-two (332 [47.0%]) patients discontinued paclitaxel treatment: 168 (23.8%) patients due to objective progression or relapse (Table 3). Listings of patient discontinuations from trastuzumab and paclitaxel are provided in Appendix 16.2.1.4.1 and Appendix 16.2.1.4.2, respectively. A Kaplan-Meier plot of time to discontinuation from trastuzumab is presented in Figure 1. In the ITT population, the estimated median time to discontinuation from trastuzumab (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 12.25 months (11.93, 14.52 months) for the PF-05280014 group and 12.06 months (11.76, 13.86 months) for the trastuzumab-EU group. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups (Table 4). Four hundred and fifty-one (451 [63.8%]) patients completed the study (Table 2) and 256 (36.2%) patients discontinued from the study (including the 5 patients who did not receive any study drug): 112 (15.8%) patients due to death, 56 (7.9%) patients due to study terminated by Sponsor, 52 (7.4%) patients due to no longer being willing to participate in the study, 26 (3.7%) patients were lost to follow-up, 7 (1.0%) patients for ‘other’ reasons, and 3 (1.0%) patients had a protocol violation (Table 3). Of the patients who discontinued from the study, 53 (7.5%) patients discontinued prior to long term follow-up and 198 (28.0%) during the long term follow-up (Table 2). A listing of patient discontinuations from the study is provided in Appendix 16.2.1.3. Table 2.

Source: Figure 14.1.1.4.1. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Patient demographics were comparable across treatment groups. All patients were female and over 18 years of age. The majority of patients were 45 to 64 years of age (61.2%) and of White race (67.3%) (Table 14.1.2.1). All patients randomized (n=707) had a diagnosis of breast cancer. Characteristics of breast cancer were comparable across treatment groups; the most frequently reported histology classification was ductal (278 [79.0%] and 277 [78.0%] patients for the PF-05280014 and the trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) duration since diagnosis of breast cancer was 24.8 (37.81) months, with a range of 0 to 284 months, and 22.4 (29.83) months, with a range of 0 to 157 months for the PF-05280014 and the trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively (Table 14.1.2.2.1). Documentation of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression as measured by IHC and/or in-situ hybridization (ISH) was reported for all patients (Table 14.1.2.2.2). The exception was 1 patient in the PF-05280014 group who had a negative IHC and unknown ISH result (Appendix 16.2.4.2.2) and presented without measurable disease at baseline per the central reviewer; therefore, the patient was removed from the per protocol population. Baseline ECOG status was comparable across treatment groups. All patients had a baseline ECOG score of 0 to 2; the majority of patients (676 [95.6%]) had a baseline ECOG score of non-evaluable or clinically significant abnormal LVEF reading at baseline (Table 14.1.2.5.1). The baseline stratification factors were comparable across treatment groups. There were 184 (52.3%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 184 (51.8%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group who had a positive ER status at baseline. The corresponding numbers of patients with prior trastuzumab exposure were 33 (9.4%) and 39 (11.0%), respectively (Table 14.1.2.5.2). At baseline, the sites of disease were lymph node (511 [72.3%] patients), breast (383 [54.2%]), lung (371 [52.5%]), bone (361 [51.1%]), liver (312 [44.1%]), skin (78 [11.0%]), brain (8 [1.1%]), and other (149 [21.1%]). Overall, disease sites were comparable across treatment groups (Table 14.1.2.5.3). For both treatment groups, analysis of tumor HER2 status indicated high concordance between central and local laboratory assessments for patients who entered the study with local test result(s); 290 patients (89.8%) in the PF-05280014 group and 286 (89.1%) patients had concordant HER2-positive results (Table 14.1.2.6). Significant medical history (other than the primary diagnosis) was reported for the majority of patients (586 [82.9%]) and was comparable across treatments groups. Approximately half of the patients had received prior surgery (not including all biopsies) for their primary diagnosis (353 [49.9%] patients) and this was comparable for both groups. Overall, 309 (43.7%) patients had received previous systemic therapy; 232 (32.8%) patients had received prior radiation therapy (Table 14.4.2). Details of significant medical history other than primary diagnosis are provided in Table 14.4.2.1.1. There were 152 (43.2%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 157 (44.2%) in the trastuzumab-EU group who received previous systemic therapy for breast cancer in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting (Table 14.4.2). Those previous therapies reported in ≥5% of patients included cyclophosphamide (255 [36.1%] patients), doxorubicin (214 [30.3%] patients), fluorouracil (148 [20.9%] patients), docetaxel (72 [10.2%] patients), trastuzumab (72 [10.2%] patients), tamoxifen (69 [9.8%] patients), and paclitaxel (55 [7.8%] patients), with comparable proportions reported in both treatment groups (Table 14.4.2.1.2.1). The incidence of prior radiation therapy was comparable across treatment groups (115 [32.7%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 117 [33.0%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) (Table 14.4.2 and Table 14.4.2.1.3).

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Protocol Deviations COVID-19 protocol deviations recorded for this study are summarized in Table 5 and a listing is provided in Appendix 16.2.2.1. Overall, 10 (1.4%) patients had protocol deviations related to COVID-19. Of these, 9 (1.3%) patients had dosing non-compliance and 1 (0.1%) patient had disease assessments and ECHO/MUGA performed outside of the allowable window per the site’s SoC, which was considered a protocol deviation.

Results for the secondary measures of tumor control endpoints were reported in the Week 53 CSR, dated 21 July 2017. Continued treatment during Treatment Period 2 was based on documented evidence of clinical benefit provided to the Sponsor at regular intervals as determined by local SoC disease assessment frequency. The results for OS reported here are cumulative data from Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2. The percentage of patients who died was comparable across treatment groups. There were 61 (17.3%) and 67 (18.9%) patients who died in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively (Table 6). These deaths are discussed in the safety results section. survival) in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively. The survival probability (95% CI) was 89.36% (85.56%, 92.21%) and 87.50% (83.46%, 90.61%) at 1 year, 82.26% (77.21%, 86.29%) and 77.42% (71.73%, 82.10%) at 2 years, and 77.23% (70.47%, 82.63%) and 75.29% (68.87%, 80.57%) at 3 years for the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively. Using a Cox Proportional Hazards Model with prior trastuzumab exposure (yes/no) and ER status (ER positive vs. ER negative) as strata, the hazard ratio when comparing OS between PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU, was 0.929, with 95% CI of 0.656, 1.316. The stratified log-rank test resulted in a 1-sided p-value of 0.339, indicating no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups.

Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Immunogenicity Results The results for these endpoints were reported in the Week 53 CSR, dated 21 July 2017. Safety Results The safety results reported here are cumulative data from Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2. A listing of study treatment administration is provided in Appendix 16.2.5.1. The mean (SD) duration of treatment for patients receiving PF-05280014 was 74.7 (68.03) weeks, with 31.5 (18.43) weeks of paclitaxel treatment, and for those patients receiving trastuzumab-EU, the mean (SD) duration of treatment was 78.3 (74.44) weeks, with 33.0 (18.69) weeks of paclitaxel treatment (Table 14.4.1.1). All-Causality Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events A summary of all-causality TEAEs is provided in Table 7. A summary of the incidence of all-causality TEAEs by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and PT is provided in Table 14.3.1.2.3.1. A summary of the incidence of all-causality TEAEs by SOC, PT and maximum CTCAE grade is provided in Table 14.3.1.2.9.1.1. The majority of all patients experienced at least 1 TEAE with 344 (98.6%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 341 (96.6%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group reporting a total of 2692 and 2789 events, respectively. The incidence for all categories of TEAEs and serious TEAEs was comparable across treatment groups, consistent with those previously reported, and with no new clinically relevant findings observed. Tier-2 events were those that occurred in 5% patients in at least 1 treatment group (and that were not Tier-1 events). A summary of Tier-2 TEAEs by SOC and PT is provided in Table 8. The incidence of TEAEs was generally comparable across treatment groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs (20% in either treatment group) were alopecia (189 [54.2%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 186 [52.7%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), anaemia (124 [35.5%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 136 [38.5%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), neutropenia (100 [28.7%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 95 [26.9%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (93 [26.6%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 85 [24.1%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group). The most frequently reported TEAEs of special interest (Tier-1) were ejection fraction decreased (49 [14.0%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 47 [13.3%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), infusion related reaction (34 [9.7%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 32 [9.1%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), and pyrexia (29 [8.3%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 24 [6.8%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group). There were no statistically significant treatment differences in the incidences of any of the identified Tier-1 events (Table 9). Table 7.

Patients discontinued due to adverse events imply those subjects that permanently discontinued the study treatment Treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as any event that occurred on or after the first dose of study treatment administration or any pre-existing event which worsened in severity after dosing. Treatment related: related to trastuzumab and/or paclitaxel. Trastuzumab related: related only to trastuzumab; paclitaxel related: related only to paclitaxel. TEAE was defined through last dose of trastuzumab + 70 days. Note: for number of TEAEs, the event of ‘infusion related reaction’ was counted; however, the specific associated signs and symptoms were counted in a separate table (Table 14.3.1.2.1.2). Table 8.

Note: 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) are provided to help gauge the precision of the estimates for risk difference. Analysis conducted using exact methods (Chan and Zhang 1999). p-values and CIs were not adjusted for multiplicity and should be used for screening purposes only. Risk difference was computed as PF-05280014 vs. trastuzumab-EU. Note: Tier-1 events were pre-specified events of clinical importance that are maintained in a list in the product’s safety review plan including anaphylactic reaction, cardiac failure, chills, dyspnoea, ejection fraction decreased, infusion related reaction, interstitial lung disease, left ventricular dysfunction, pruritus, and pyrexia. MedDRA (version 23.0) coding dictionary applied. There were 57 (16.3%) patients in the PF-05280014 group and 52 (14.7%) patients in the trastuzumab-EU group who were permanently discontinued from trastuzumab and/or paclitaxel due to TEAEs (Table 7). A summary of events is provided in Table 14.3.1.1.4.1. The most frequent event leading to discontinuation of trastuzumab treatment was ejection fraction decreased (6 [1.7%] and 8 [2.3%] patients in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively) (Table 14.3.1.1.4.1). A listing of patient discontinuations from trastuzumab treatment is provided in Appendix 16.2.1.4.1. The most frequent event leading to discontinuation of paclitaxel treatment was peripheral sensory neuropathy (20 [5.7%] and 15 [4.2%] patients in the PF-05280014 and trastuzumab-EU groups, respectively) (Table 14.3.1.1.4.1). A listing of patient discontinuations from paclitaxel treatment is provided in Appendix 16.2.1.4.2. Deaths In total, there were 101 (14.4%) patients (45 [12.9%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 56 [15.9%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) who died within 183 days (6 months) after the last dose of study treatment. A further 27 (3.8%) patients (16 [4.6%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 11 [3.1%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) died more than 183 days (6 months) after the last dose of study treatment (Table 14.3.2.1.2). The most frequent reason for death was due to disease progression. Of the total of 128 (18.2%) deaths, 112 (16.0%) patients (57 [16.3%] in the PF-05280014 group and 55 [15.6%] in the trastuzumab-EU group) were reported to have died from the disease under study (other causes may also have been reported) (Table 14.3.2.1.2). One (1) patient in the trastuzumab-EU group had disease under study as the cause of death and a Grade 5 TEAE of pneumonia aspiration (Appendix 16.2.7.1.1 and Appendix 16.2.7.4); however, the patient’s cause of death was incorrectly reported as only due to the Grade 5 pneumonia aspiration in Table 14.3.2.1. Overall, 3 (0.4%) patients (all in the trastuzumab-EU group [0.8%]) died due to study drug toxicity (in the opinion of the investigator) (Table 14.3.2.1.2). All 3 of these patients in the trastuzumab-EU group died due to TEAEs that coded to the SOC of cardiac disorders (Appendix 16.2.7.1.1 and Appendix 16.2.7.4). Twelve (12) (1.7%) patients (4 [1.1%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 8 [2.3%] in the trastuzumab-EU group) died due to ‘other’ reasons (Table 14.3.2.1.2). Of these 12 patients, 3 died due to TEAEs that coded to the SOC of cardiac disorders (2 in the PF-05280014 group and 1 in the trastuzumab-EU group), 2 deaths were due to TEAEs that coded to the SOC of vascular disorders (trastuzumab-EU), 2 deaths were due to TEAEs that coded to the SOC of infections and infestations (1 in each treatment group), and 1 death each was due to TEAEs that coded to the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders (trastuzumab-EU), general disorders and administration site conditions (trastuzumab-EU), neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (PF-05280014), nervous system disorders (trastuzumab-EU), and respiratory, Appendix 16.2.7.4). Two (2) (0.3%) patients (both trastuzumab-EU [0.8%]) died due to ‘unknown’ reasons, which includes deaths with reason ‘not reported’ (Table 14.3.2.1.2). Other Serious Adverse Events A listing of all SAEs is provided in Table 14.3.2.2 and Appendix 16.2.7.1.4. Overall, 187 (26.6%) patients (91 [26.1%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 96 [27.2%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) experienced at least 1 SAE (Table 14.3.2.4.3.1). The most frequently reported SAEs were disease progression (84 [12.0%] patients; 42 [12.0%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 42 [11.9%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), pneumonia (10 [1.4%] patients; 6 [1.7%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 4 [1.1%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group), and pulmonary embolism (8 [1.1%] patients; 5 [1.4%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 3 [0.8%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group ) (Table 14.3.2.4.3.1). Other Observations Related to Safety There were 2 patients (both in the trastuzumab-EU group) who met the laboratory criteria for potential Hy’s Law cases, neither of which was considered a confirmed case (Appendix 16.2.8.1.4). The narrative for one case is provided in Section 14.3.3; the other case was reported in the Week 53 CSR, dated 21 July 2017. Comparable proportions of patients between the treatment groups in the overall safety population had ≥1 event of an absolute decline in LVEF ≥16% from baseline (22 [6.3%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 19 [5.4%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) (Table 14.3.4.3.8.3 and Appendix 16.2.8.3.1.1). Similarly, the proportions of patients in the overall safety population who had ≥1 event of an absolute decline in LVEF ≥10% from baseline and below the LLN were balanced across the treatment groups (14 [4.0%] patients in the PF-05280014 group and 18 [5.1%] patients in the trastuzumab-EU group) (Table 14.3.4.3.8.4 and Appendix 16.2.8.3.1.1). Death Narratives Only narratives for events meeting narrative criteria after the Week 53 CSR data cutoff are included in this CSR. Please refer to the Week 53 CSR, dated 21 July 2017, for narratives of events that occurred prior to the Week 53 CSR data cutoff. For narratives related to deaths, see Section 14.3.3. Other Serious Adverse Event Narratives For narratives related to other SAEs, see Section 14.3.3. For narratives related to non-serious AEs (NSAEs) of special interest (Tier-1, Grade 3 or 4), NSAEs resulting in permanent discontinuation from the study of study drug (PF-05280014 or trastuzumab-EU only), and potential Hy’s Law cases, see Section 14.3.3. CONCLUSION Long term safety and OS data were consistent with previously reported findings from this study, with no clinically meaningful differences observed between the treatment groups.
