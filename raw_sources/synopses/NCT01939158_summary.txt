OBJECTIVES Secondary Immunogenicity Objective and Endpoint: Only the objective relating to the hSBA immunogenicity endpoint at 5 years after vaccination is presented in this report (Table S1). Table S1. Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: MenACWY-TT-104 (C0921003) is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the immunogenicity after 1 month and the persistence of the response up to 5 years following 1 and 2 doses (given 2 months apart) of meningococcal polysaccharide groups A, C, W-135, and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) in toddlers aged 12 to 14 months and to demonstrate noninferiority of coadministration of MenACWY-TT and Prevenar 13, versus separate administration of the 2 vaccines. There were 4 parallel groups, and each planned to enroll 200 participants. The 4 study groups and vaccine(s) received are defined below:  ACWY1d group: Participants who received 1 dose of MenACWY-TT at Month 0;  ACWY2d group: Participants who received 2 doses of MenACWY-TT, 1 dose at Month 0 and 1 dose at Month 2;  Co-ad group: Participants who received 1 dose of MenACWY-TT and 1 dose of Prevenar 13 at Month 0;  PCV13 group: Participants who received 1 dose of Prevenar 13 at Month 0 and 1 dose of MenACWY-TT at Month 2. The planned duration of the study was 62 months for each participant. This report presents the objectives and endpoints relating to the hSBA immunogenicity endpoints for Year 5 (Visit 7). The participants in the ACWY1d and the Co-ad groups were to be 72 to 74 months of age and the participants in the ACWY2d and PCV13 groups were to be 74 to 76 months of age at this visit. This supplemental CSR presents the Year 5 hSBA immunogenicity results. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Eligibility to participate in the study is described in Section 5.3 of the 116892 (MenACWY-TT-104) CSR. Vaccines Administered: No investigational product was administered beyond the vaccination phase previously reported in the 116892 (MenACWY-TT-104) CSR. Immunogenicity Evaluations: Blood samples from participants in the ACWY1d and ACWY2d groups were tested for serum bactericidal assay using human complement to measure activity against Neisseria meningitidis group A (hSBA-MenA), serum bactericidal assay using human complement to measure activity against Neisseria meningitidis group C (hSBA-MenC), serum bactericidal assay using human complement to measure activity against Neisseria meningitidis group W-135 (hSBA-MenW-135), and serum bactericidal assay using human complement to measure activity against Neisseria meningitidis group Y (hSBA-MenY) titers. 1. Blood samples from the first 50% of enrolled participants within each country (according to their enrollment date) from groups ACWY1d and ACWY2d were tested for hSBA-MenA and hSBA-MenC titers at all sampling time points planned for each group. 2. Blood samples from the remaining 50% of enrolled participants within each country (according to their enrollment date) from groups ACWY1d and ACWY2d were tested for hSBA-MenW-135 and hSBA-MenY titers at all sampling time points planned for each group. Statistical Methods: The number and percentage of participants for immunogenicity endpoints were tabulated with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by vaccine group. The geometric mean titer (GMT) calculations were performed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log titer transformations. Antibody titers below the cutoff of the assay were given a value of half the cutoff for the purpose of GMT calculation. RESULTS Immunogenicity Results: A secondary objective of the Year 5 analysis was to evaluate the long-term persistence of the immune response induced by 1 or 2 doses of MenACWY-TT with respect to hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135, and hSBA-MenY titers in a subset of participants in the ACWY1d and ACWY2d groups. Table S2 presents the number and percentage of participants with hSBA titers equal to or above the cutoff values (1:4 and 1:8) and GMTs for the adapted ATP cohort. Number and percentages of participants with hSBA titers ≥1:8 in the ACWY1d and ACWY2d groups were low before vaccination and increased at 1 month, 1 year, and 3 years compared to baseline (see MenACWY-TT-104 [C0921003] Year 1 CSR and MenACWY-TT-104 [C0921003] Year 3 CSR for a full discussion of these results). At 5 years after the last vaccination (first or second dose), the percentages of participants achieving hSBA titers ≥1:8 in the ACWY1d and ACWY2d groups were 27.9% and 17.9%, respectively, for hSBA-MenA; 60.7% and 67.8%, respectively, for hSBA-MenC; 58.9% and 63.6%, respectively, for hSBA-MenW-135; and 61.5% and 54.2%, respectively, for hSBA-MenY. GMTs 5 years after the last vaccination for participants in the ACWY1d and ACWY2d groups were 4.4 and 3.1, respectively, for hSBA-MenA; 18.1 and 29.4, respectively, for hSBA-MenC; 20.8 and 19.5, respectively, for hSBA-MenW-135; and 24.3 and 16.8, respectively, for hSBA-MenY. Compared to prevaccination levels, GMTs for each group were higher at 5 years after vaccination. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Table S2.

Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 27MAY2021. Runtime ID: 03JUN2021 01:27. File ID: 28_IMM_H_ATP.HTM. Conclusion(s): Antibody persistence at Year 5 was similar for participants receiving 1 dose of MenACWY-TT (ACWY1d group) and participants receiving 2 doses of MenACWY-TT (ACWY2d group), as measured by the percentage of participants with hSBA titers equal to or above predefined cutoff values. Overall, the results of the Year 5 hSBA analysis continue to support a favorable benefit risk assessment for the administration of 1 or 2 doses of MenACWY-TT in this age group.
