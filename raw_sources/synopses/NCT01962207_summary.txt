Secondary safety objectives Persistence phase  To describe serious adverse events (SAEs) related to vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy (ie, meningococcal disease) from the last persistence time point the subject participated in up to each yearly visit in the current study in a retrospective Booster phase  To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT. METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 3b, open-label, multi-center, study with 4 parallel groups to evaluate the persistence of meningococcal antibodies 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years after primary vaccination with MenACWY-TT, Meningitec, or Mencevax ACWY in children who participated in Study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658). The immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenticy of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT in subjects who had received primary vaccination with MenACWY-TT, Meningitec, or Mencevax ACWY was also evaluated. There were 4 parallel groups with the subjects being allocated to the same groups as the previous study (MenACWY-TT-027 [108658]):  ACWY<2 group: vaccinated with MenACWY-TT in Study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658) and aged <2 years at the time of primary vaccination,  MenCCRM group: vaccinated with Meningitec in Study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658) and aged <2 years at the time of primary vaccination,  ACWY2 group: vaccinated with MenACWY-TT in Study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658) and aged 2 years at the time of primary vaccination,  MenPS group: vaccinated with Mencevax ACWY in Study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658) and aged 2 years at the time of primary vaccination. All subjects who were vaccinated in Study MenACWY-TT-027 were invited to participate in this study. Approximately, 488 subjects were expected to participate in the study. The duration of the study was as follows: Persistence phase  Epoch 001: Persistence Visit 1 (Month 78 [Year 6] after primary vaccination)  Epoch 002: Persistence Visit 2 (Month 90 [Year 7] after primary vaccination)  Epoch 003: Persistence Visit 3 (Month 102 [Year 8] after primary vaccination)  Epoch 004: Persistence Visit 4 (Month 114 [Year 9] after primary vaccination)  Epoch 005: Persistence Visit 5 (Month 126 [Year 10] after primary vaccination) Booster phase  Epoch 005: Booster phase starting at Visit 5 (Month 126 [Year 10] after primary vaccination) and ending at the phone contact (Month 132 or 6 months after booster vaccination) Table S1 presents the study groups and epochs in the study. Table S1. Study Groups and Epochs in the Study Study Groups Number Age (Min/Max) Epochs of Epoch 001, Epoch 002, Subjectsa Epoch 003, Epoch 004, Epoch 005 1-<2 years at primary 183 x ACWY<2 vaccination 1-<2 years at primary MenCCRM 61 x vaccination 2-10 years at primary ACWY2 183 x vaccination 2-10 years at primary MenPS 61 x vaccination a. The actual sample size of this study with respect to the analysis of persistence and safety and immunogenicity postbooster was determined by a) the sample size of the primary vaccination Study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658), b) by assumptions about the enrollment rate at the Years 6 to 10 extension study, and c) by assumptions about the annual dropout rate.

Analysis of Safety: Persistence Analyses At each persistence time point, all reported SAEs related to vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy since the last persistent time point the subject participated in up to each persistence visit in the current study was described in detail in a retrospective manner. Postbooster Analyses For each vaccine group, after the booster vaccination administered at Visit 5:  The numbers and percentages of subjects with at least 1 local event (solicited and unsolicited), with at least 1 general event (solicited and unsolicited), and with any event during the 4-day (Days 0-3) solicited follow-up period were tabulated with exact 95% confidence interval (CI). The same calculations were performed for events rated as Grade 3 and for events related to vaccination.  The numbers and percentages of subjects reporting each solicited local (any grade, Grade 3, medical advice) and general (any grade, Grade 3, related, Grade 3 and related, medical advice) event during the 4-day follow-up period (Days 0-3) after vaccination and their exact 95% CI were tabulated. Occurrence of fever was also reported to 0.5° C cumulative increment as well as the percentage of subjects with oral temperature >39.5° C.  The numbers and percentages of subjects who reported SAEs and new-onset chronic illnesses from booster vaccination until the end of the study were tabulated with exact 95% CI.  Any SAEs and large injection site reactions were to be described in detail.  The percentages of subjects using concomitant medication (any medication, any antipyretic/analgesic, any antipyretic/analgesic taken prophylactically, respectively) during the 4-day and 31-day follow-up periods (Days 0-3 and Days 0-30, respectively) Other Analyses: Persistence Analyses: Demographic characteristics of subjects in each study cohort were tabulated: age (in years) at Month X (with the range and standard deviation), sex, and geographic ancestry. The distribution of subjects enrolled in this study among the study sites was tabulated as a whole and per group. The reasons for not enrolling were summarized for all subjects who were vaccinated in the primary study (Study MenACWY-TT-027 [108658]). Postbooster Analyses: Demographic characteristics of subjects in each study cohort were tabulated: age (in years) at booster vaccination (with the range and standard deviation), sex, and geographic ancestry. The distribution of subjects among the study sites was tabulated as a whole and per group.

N = number of subjects. f. n = Number of subjects within each category. g. % = Percentage of subjects within each category was calculated based on booster total vaccinated cohort in booster phase. The study population consisted of a similar percentage of male and female subjects, with a mean age of 10.7 years (range 7 to 18) (Table S3). The majority of subjects were white (97.9%) and not of American Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (100%). Overall, demographic characteristics (sex, race, and ethnicity) were similar over time. The mean ages were 10.7, 11.5, 12.3, 13.3, and 14.0 years at Months 78, 90, 102, 114, and 126, respectively. Demographic characteristics for the booster total vaccinated cohort were similar to the total cohort (Table S4). The mean of age of subjects in the booster total vaccinated cohort was 13.8 years, with a range of 11 to 20 years. Immunogenicity Results: In general, for the all vaccine groups, vaccine meningococcal antibodies persisted from Months 78 to 126 after vaccination with MenACWY-TT, Mencevax ACWY, or Meningitec. The percentage of subjects with rSBA and hSBA titers greater than or equal to the cutoff values (1:8 and 1:128 for rSBA and 1:4 and 1:8 for hSBA) and GMTs for the adapted according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort remained generally stable across all time-points. The persistence of the rSBA-MenC and hSBA-MenC immune response over time was similar in the ACWY<2, ACWY2, MenPS, and MenCCRM groups and was higher among subjects who had received an additional dose of MenC conjugate vaccine during Study MenACWY- TT-027 (108658). The number of subjects with rSBA and hSBA results in the MenCCRM and MenPS groups was much smaller than that of the ACWY-TT groups for rSBAs for MenA, MenW-135, and MenY, limiting the accuracy of comparison between the groups. For subjects who received a booster vaccination 10 years after the primary vaccination, a robust booster vaccination response was observed. In all vaccine groups the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY titers 1:8 increased from 0% to 89.0% at Month 126 to 94.1% to 100% at Month 127 (1 month after booster vaccination) and the percentage of subjects with hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW 135, and hSBA-MenY titers 1:4 increased from 20.0% to 100.0% at Month 126 to 87.5% to 100% at Month 127 (1 month after booster vaccination). No clinically relevant differences were observed in vaccine response between subjects who were initially seronegative before the booster vaccination and those who were initially seropositive before the booster vaccination. Safety Results: In the total enrolled cohort, 2 AEs leading to study withdrawal were reported by 2 subjects in the ACWY2 group. One (1) subject each withdrew because of an AE of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (moderate severity) and depression (severe); both AEs were considered to be unrelated to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. Following the booster vaccination, 23.9% of subjects in the ACWY<2 group, 31.3% of subjects in the MenCCRM group, 35.1% of subjects in the ACWY2 group, and 52.4% of subjects in the MenPS group reported at least 1 AE during the 31-day postbooster vaccination period. AEs occurring in 5% of subjects and >1 subject in any given vaccine group included: pyrexia (12.5% [2 subjects] of the MenCCRM group), upper respiratory tract infection (9.1% [7 subjects] of the ACWY2 group; 9.5% [2 subjects] of the MenPS group), and headache (6% [4 subjects] of the ACWY<2 group). The proportion of subjects with at least 1 AE considered to be related to the investigational vaccine by the investigator was <10% for all vaccine groups except in the ACWY2 group (15.6%). For the ACWY 2 group, the only related AE reported in more than 1 subject was upper respiratory tract reported in the ACWY2 group and was considered to be unrelated to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. No subjects were withdrawn from the study for safety-related reasons following booster vaccination. Most solicited local and general events were mild to moderate in severity and none led to study withdrawal. Conclusion(s): Antibody persistence was demonstrated 6 to 10 years after primary vaccination with MenACWY-TT, Meningitec, or Mencevax ACWY. Regardless of the primary vaccination received, booster responses were robust with higher proportions of subjects achieving protective titers 1 month after the booster vaccination than before the booster vaccination. No new safety concerns were identified in this extended follow-up study in children who received a primary vaccination of MenACWY-TT, Meningitec, or Mencevax ACWY. The booster vaccination was well tolerated in this cohort and the safety profile was acceptable.
