Study Objectives and Endpoints Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This open-label, soft tissue response rate study of talazoparib was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of talazoparib (1 mg QD [once a day], orally) monotherapy in adult male subjects with mCRPC with DNA damage repair deficiencies whose disease has previously progressed on novel hormonal therapies (NHT): enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate, given for the treatment of mCRPC and who were previously treated with taxane-based chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The study was not stopped or temporarily discontinued and is planned for completion as per protocol. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): A sample size of 100 male participants with measurable soft tissue disease and confirmed tumor mutation in a DDR gene was planned for this study. A total of 1425 participants were screened (includes screened and pre- screened subjects) and 127 were treated with Talazoparib. The following populations were used for efficacy or safety analysis: 104 in the DDR Deficient Measurable Disease set; 62 in the CTC Evaluable set, 97 in the patient-reported outcome (PRO) set, 127 in the PK set, and 127 in the Safety set. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Adult men with DNA repair defects and mCRPC who previously received taxane-based chemotherapy and whose disease has previously progressed on at least one NHT were enrolled in this study. Study Treatment: The daily dose of talazoparib is 1 mg QD given orally at approximately the same time each day. The starting and maximum dose will be 0.75 mg QD for participants with moderate renal impairment at screening (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]: 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 per central laboratory). Lots used in this study are as shown in the Table S2. Table S2.

Biomarker Evaluations: Biomarker response to talazoparib was assessed using targeted gene sequencing; targeted and/or whole-exome/-genome and/or transcriptome analyses, and/or epigenetic analyses; and targeted sequencing panel which included DDR genes. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Binary data: The rates of binary proportions were presented along with a 2-sided exact 95% CI (confidence interval) using the Clopper-Pearson method. Continuous data: Descriptive statistics, including the number of non-missing observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum (min), and maximum (max) values, were provided for continuous variables Longitudinal data: A longitudinal mixed effect model was used for the analysis of data measured repeatedly over time. Categorical data: The number and percentage of participants in each category was provided for categorical variables. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: The 127 participants (of which 104 had measurable disease) treated with talazoparib were considered representative of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) participants. 104/127 participants were the DDR Deficient Measurable Disease Population (DDR DMDP) (participants with mCRPC with measurable soft tissue disease per RECIST 1.1 and DDR deficiencies). Baseline Demographic Characteristic: Median (min, max) age of all participants was 69.00 (46.00, 84.00) years. The majority of all participants 47.2% (60/127) were 65-74 years of age. The majority of all participants were white 86.6% (110/127) and in European Union/Great Britain (GBR) 77.2% (98/127). Efficacy Results: Primary Efficacy Endpoint Results: ORR  29.8% (31/104; 95% CI: 21.2%, 39.6%) of participants had a confirmed objective response (OR) (either a CR or PR in soft tissue based on BICR assessment with no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression). 23.1% (24/104) of response was PR and 6.7% (7/104) of response was CR. Similar results were obtained from investigator assessed data with 30.8% (32/104; 95% CI: 22.1%, 40.6%) of participants achieving a confirmed OR (either a CR or PR in soft tissue based on investigator assessment with no evidence of confirmed bone disease progression). 29.8% (31/104) of response was PR and 1.0% (1/104) of response was CR.  45.9% (28/61; 95% CI: 33.1%, 59.2%) of participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation had a confirmed OR with a CR response of 9.8% (6/61) of participants achieving a CR, based on BICR assessment. Investigator assessed data of 45.9% (28/61; 95% CI: 33.1%, 59.2%) of participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation had a confirmed OR, with 1.6% (1/61) of participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation achieving a CR response.  The majority of participants had postbaseline tumor regression based on BICR assessment. These results were corroborated by investigator assessed data. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Results: Time to Objective Response  31/104 participants had a confirmed CR or PR based on BICR assessment. The median (min, max) time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first documented objective evidence of soft tissue response (CR or PR) based on BICR assessment was 3.4 (1.6, 7.5) months for all participants.  28/61 participants with the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutation had a confirmed CR or PR based on BICR assessment. The median (min, max) time from date of first dose of study treatment to the first documented objective evidence of soft tissue response (CR or PR) based on BICR assessment was 3.5 (1.6, 7.5) months.  Investigator-reported median (min, max) time to response was 1.9 (1.6, 13.6) months for all participants and 2.9 (1.6, 13.6) months for participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, based on 32/104 confirmed CR or PR for all participants and 28/61 confirmed CR or PR for participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutation. Duration of Response (DoR)  BICR-reported median (95% CI) DoR is 12.8 (6.5, NE [not estimable]) months for all participants and 12.8 (7.0, NE) months for participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. The probability of response lasting 12 months was 57% (95% CI: 34.3%, 74.4%) for all participants.  Investigator-reported median (95% CI) DoR was 9.0 (6.5, 15.7) months and probability of response lasting 12 months was 44.0% (95% CI: 24.0%, 62.4%) for all participants. Participants with PSA Response  Response could be assessed for 92.3% (96/104) of participants with baseline and at least 1 postbaseline PSA assessment. 45.8% (44/96) had a decrease of PSA levels ≥ 50% compared to baseline.  Similarly, response could be assessed for 96.7% (59/61) of participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations with baseline and at least 1 postbaseline PSA assessment. 66.1% (39/59) of participants had a decrease of PSA levels ≥ 50% compared to baseline.  The majority of participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations had a postbaseline reduction in PSA. Participants with CTC Conversion Count  63.6% (21/33; 95% CI: 45.1%, 79.6%) of the CTC evaluable population subset and 81.0% (17/21, 95% CI: 58.1%, 94.6%) of participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations subset with a CTC count ≥5 per 7.5 mL of blood at baseline had a decrease in count to CTC count < 5 per 7.5 mL of blood postbaseline.  53.3% (24/45; 95% CI: 37.9%, 68.3%) of the CTC evaluable population subset and 67.9% (19/28; 95% CI: 47.6%, 84.1%) of participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations subset with a CTC count ≥ 1 per 7.5 mL of blood at baseline had a decline to CTC count = 0 per 7.5 mL of blood postbaseline.  37.9% (11/29; 95% CI: 20.7%, 57.7%) of the CTC evaluable population subset and 27.8% (5/18, 95% CI: 9.7%, 53.5%) of participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations subset with a baseline CTC count <5 per 7.5 mL of blood had an increase in CTC counts postbaseline. Time to PSA Progression  The median (95% CI) time to PSA progression for all participants was 9.2 (5.6, 11.1) months and 11.1 (9.2, NE) months for participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations.  The probability of being event-free at 12 months was 34.6% (95% CI: 22.2%, 47.3%) for all participants. Radiographic PFS  The median (95% CI) rPFS was 5.6 (3.7, 8.8) months for all participants, and 11.2 (7.5, 19.2) months for participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations on BICR assessment. The investigator assessment showed longer median rPFS of 8.1 (5.5, 9.3) months for all participants, and 13.5 (8.2, 19.3) months for participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations.  The probability of being event-free at 12 months for all participants was 33.5% (95% CI: 23.2%, 44.1%) based on BICR assessment. Similar results of being event-free at 12 months for all participants with 35.0% (95% CI: 24.7%, 45.5%) were obtained from investigator assessed data. Overall Survival  The median (95% CI) OS was 16.4 (95% CI: 12.2,19.9) months for all participants, and 24.0 (95% CI: 16.2, NE) months for participants with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations.  The probability of OS at 12 months was 61.3% (95% CI: 50.2%, 70.7%) for all participants. Pharmacokinetic Results: The geometric mean (geometric %CV [coefficient of variation], n) of talazoparib steady-state drug concentration observed at the last planned timepoint prior to dosing (C ) at Weeks 5, trough 9, and 13 was 4748.1 pg/mL (63%, 82), 4213.3 pg/mL (53%, 71), and 4378.1 pg/mL (48%, 55), respectively. The geometric mean of talazoparib steady-state C was slightly higher trough in participants with moderate renal impairment compared to participants with mild renal impairment or participants with normal renal function. For example, at Week 5 visit, the geometric mean (geometric %CV, n) of talazoparib steady-state C was 6027.8 pg/mL trough (73%, 14) in participants with moderate renal impairment compared to 4481 pg/mL (50%, function, respectively. However, this higher exposure was not associated with increased AEs as the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) was generally comparable between participants with moderate renal impairment and participants with mild renal impairment or participants with normal renal function. Patient Reported Outcome Results: Time to Deterioration in Participant Report Pain (by BPI-SF)  The median (95% CI) time from the date of first dose of study treatment to onset of pain progression for the total and BRCA1/BRCA2 population was not reached.  The probability (95% CI) of being pain-free at 12 months was 84.0% (70.8%, 91.5%) for all participants.  The probability (95% CI) of being pain-free at 12 months for the BRCA1/BRCA2 subpopulation was 82.9% (66.9%, 91.6%). Change in Patient Reported Pain - (BPI-SF) Patient-reported pain showed a slight decrease from baseline consistently throughout the treatment period for all participants and for the BRCA1/BRCA2 subpopulation. General Health Status European Quality of Life 5-Domain 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L): Patient-reported general health status showed a slight increase from baseline consistently throughout the treatment period for all participants and for the BRCA1/BRCA2 subpopulation. European Quality Visual Analog Scales (EQ-VAS): Patient-reported EQ-VAS showed a slight increase from baseline consistently throughout the treatment period for all participants and for the BRCA1/BRCA2 subpopulation. Exploratory Endpoints Results: Biomarker Analysis ORR by Alteration Germline/Somatic Origin and Zygosity Prostate cancers bearing germline and/or homozygous DDRm may be more sensitive to TALAZOPARIB PROstate (TALAPRO) than those bearing only somatic and/or heterozygous DDRm. Potential reasons include gene-specific imbalances in germline/somatic origin and/or zygosity of alterations and/or differential sensitivity to TALAPRO. These data are based off retrospective analysis with a limited sample size and should be viewed as hypothesis generating.  Of 52 evaluable participants, with results from both tumor and investigational germline analysis, 51.9% (27/52) had at least one tumor DDR alteration of germline origin, 46.2% (24/52) exhibited at least one tumor DDR alteration of somatic origin, and 2/52 (3.8%) was nonassessable for origin (ATR and FANCA not in germline panel). One tumor bore DDR11 mutations of both germline and somatic origin. The most commonly altered genes were BRCA2 (51.9% [14/27] germline and 41.7% [10/24] somatic) and ATM (14.8% [4/27] germline and 29.2% [7/24] somatic). In addition to BRCA2, BRCA1 (germline/somatic: 11.1% [3/27]/[0/24]) and CHEK2 (18.5% [5/27]/8.3% [2/24]), showed a predominantly germline numeric distribution.  OR was numerically higher in participants bearing tumors with DDR gene alterations of germline origin, 25.9% (7/27), than in participants bearing tumors with DDR gene alterations of somatic origin, 9.1% (2/22), although this difference was not statistically significant (Odds Ratio [95% CI] 3.500 (0.557, 37.666), 2-sided p-value of 0.1595 based on Fisher’s exact test).  Of 77 participants with evaluable tumors, 20.8% (16/77) were predicted to bear homozygous DDR alterations, 22.1% (17/77) were predicted to bear heterozygous DDR alterations, with the remaining 57.1% (44/77) of unknown DDR alteration zygosity. ORR was numerically higher in participants bearing tumors with homozygous DDR gene alterations, 43.8% (7/16), than in participants bearing tumors with exclusively heterozygous DDR gene alterations, 11.8% (2/17), although this difference was not statistically significant (Odds Ratio [95% CI] 5.8333 (0.811, 65.841), 2-sided p-value of 0.0570 based on Fisher’s exact test. Overall Genomic Alteration Landscape: The overall tumor alteration landscape in enrolled participants in this study was assessed using the full FoundationOne® dataset, with tumor alterations defined as known/likely pathogenic variants. When copy number alterations (CNAs) were excluded, the most commonly altered non-DDR genes (prevalence ≥10%) were TMPRSS2, its fusion partner ERG, TP53, and PTEN. When only CNAs were included, the most commonly altered non-DDR genes were PTEN, androgen receptor (AR), and MYC (prevalence ≥10%). Safety Results: The median exposure time: 6.05 months for all participants in the safety population. All-Causality Treatment-Emergent AEs and Serious AEs (SAEs): 95.3% (121/127) and 33.9% (43/127) of participants experienced TEAEs and treatment-emergent serious AE (TE- SAEs), respectively. The most frequent (≥20%) TEAEs reported were anemia 48.8% (62/127), nausea 33.1% (42/127), decreased appetite 28.3% (36/127), and asthenia 23.6% (30/127). The most frequent (≥2%) TE-SAEs reported were pulmonary embolism 6.3% (8/127), anemia 3.9% (5/127), disease progression 3.1% (4/127), pneumonia 2.4% (3/127), and urinary tract infection 2.4% (3/127). Treatment-Related AEs and SAEs: 78.7% (100/127) and 8.7% (11/127) of participants experienced treatment-related AEs and treatment-related SAEs, respectively. The most frequent (≥20%) treatment-related TEAEs were anemia 42.5% (54/127) and nausea 22.8% (29/127). The most frequent treatment-related SAEs reported were anemia 3.9% (5/127) and platelet count decreased 1.6% (2/127). Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI): AESI include acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), venous thrombotic events (VTE), pneumonitis, and second primary malignancies (other than hematologic).  No events of AML or MDS were reported for any participant in the safety population.  VTE were reported in 9.4% (12/127) of participants. The most common event was pulmonary embolism 6.3% ( 8/127). However, all except 1 pulmonary embolism were considered unrelated to study intervention.  Secondary primary malignancies (other than hematologic) were reported in 2.4% (3/127) of participants. All of which were considered unrelated to study intervention. Of note, the secondary primary malignancy, Lymphangiosis carcinomatosa, experienced by 1 participant was incorrectly captured as a second primary malignancy, rather it was attributed to progressive disease by the investigator.  Pneumonitis was reported in 1.6% (2/127) of participants. One participant had bilateral pneumonitis (Grade 2) reported by the investigator as related to the participant’s primary disease and resolved with concomitant medication. The second participant had asymptomatic pneumonitis (Grade 1) reported as treatment-related, which was ongoing at the time the participant’s participation in the study ended. Talazoparib dose modification and permanent discontinuations due to AEs: TEAEs (all- causality) leading to talazoparib dose reduction were reported in 26.0% (33/127) of participants. Low rates of permanent discontinuation due to all‑causality TEAEs occurred in 11.8% (15/127) of participants. Hematologic TEAEs of Special Interest:  All-causality hematologic TEAEs reported were ANEMIA in 48.8% (62/127) of participants, THROMBOCYTOPENIA was reported in 18.9% (24/127) of participants, and NEUTROPENIA was reported in 16.5% (21/127) of participants. THROMBOCYTOPENIA and LYMPHOPENIA were the only Grade 4 hematologic TEAE reported. There were no Grade 5 hematologic TEAEs reported.  Treatment-related hematologic TEAEs reported were ANEMIA in 42.5% (54/127) of participants, THROMBOCYTOPENIA in 17.3% (22/127) of participants, and NEUTROPENIA in 15.0% (19/127) of participants. THROMBOCYTOPENIA and LYMPHOPENIA were the only Grade 4 treatment-related hematologic TEAE reported. There were no Grade 5 treatment-related hematologic TEAEs reported. Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events:  As of the data cutoff, 54.3% (69/127) of deaths were reported. The most common cause of death was disease progression (46.5% [59/127]).  No deaths were attributed to study treatment toxicity. Clinical Laboratory Results:  A total of 19.4% (24/124) and 16.1% (20/124) of participants experienced a lab shift to Grade 3 or 4 postbaseline of anemia and decreased lymphocyte count, respectively.  The most common (≥5%) shifts to Grade 3 or 4 post baseline were increased alkaline phosphatase in 7.2% (9/125) of participants and increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in 6.0% (3/50) of participants.  The overall incidence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values ≥3× upper limit of normal (ULN) was 1.6% (2/127), with 1 participant each experiencing ALT ≥3× ULN or AST ≥3× ULN. No participants met the criteria for a potential Hy’s Law case. Vital Sign Results: A total of 12.0% (15/125) of participants experienced a diastolic blood pressure of ≥20 mmHg increase from baseline and 0.8% (1) of participants experienced a heart rate of 120 bpm and increase from baseline of >30 bpm, considered potentially clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS The TALAPRO-1 data provides evidence of substantial and durable antitumor efficacy, with a favorable benefit-risk profile in a heavily pretreated patient population, suggesting that talazoparib can provide an effective salvage therapy for patients with DDR-mutated advanced mCRPC, thus addressing the high unmet medical need for this patient population. Efficacy: TALAPRO-1 demonstrated robust antitumor activity of single agent talazoparib in a heavily pretreated DDR-mutated mCRPC patient population who had received prior NHT and docetaxel. Further, 47.1% of participants in the DDR DMDP also received cabazitaxel in addition to prior docetaxel and NHT in the mCRPC treatment setting, reflective of the heavily pretreated and advanced disease population recruited into the study. Talazoparib monotherapy resulted in encouraging antitumor activity as measured by the confirmed overall response rate in the efficacy (DDR DMDP) population, with a clinically meaningful duration of response and rPFS. Overall survival data supports the conclusion that talazoparib is clinically beneficial. PK:  Talazoparib steady-state C was similar between weeks 5 and 13 indicating that trough talazoparib reached steady state by Week 5 which is consistent with its mean terminal half-life of ~ 90 hours.  Talazoparib steady-state C was slightly higher in participants with moderate renal trough impairment compared to participants with mild renal impairment or participants with normal renal function. However, the incidence of TEAEs was generally comparable between participants with moderate renal impairment and participants with mild renal impairment or participants with normal renal function. PRO: The median time to deterioration for pain progression as measured by BPI-SF for the PRO population and the BRCA1/BRCA2 subset were both not reached. Summary scores for BPI-SF, EQ-5D-5L index, and EQ-VAS showed a general improvement over time. Safety: Talazoparib 1 mg QD was generally tolerated in participants with mCRPC with DNA damage repair deficiencies, and TEAEs were manageable through dosing interruption, dose reduction, and/or standard supportive care. The safety profile to date in the TALAPRO- 1 study was consistent with the known safety profile of talazoparib . No new safety signals were identified.
