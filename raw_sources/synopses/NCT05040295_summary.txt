CSR Version and Report Date: Final CSR Version 1.0: 25 March 2022 Number of Study Center(s) and Investigator(s): A total of 12 participants were enrolled at 1 center in the United States. A list of study centers and investigators involved in this study is provided in Appendix 16.1.4.1. Publications: None Study Period: Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 10 September 2021 Study Completion Date (Last Participant Last Visit): 19 November 2021 This study was neither discontinued nor interrupted. Rationale: The primary objective of this study was to obtain an estimate of the bioavailability of a single oral dose of pediatric ritlecitinib capsules (3 × 10 mg capsules) relative to the 30 mg adult capsule in healthy adult participants under fasting conditions. Additionally, an alternative pediatric formulation utilizing a spray congealed beads was also evaluated. Objectives, Endpoints, and Statistical Methods: Study objectives and endpoints are listed in Table S1. Statistical methods are summarized Pharmacokinetic (PK): PK Concentration Set: All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and who took at least 1 dose of study intervention and in whom at least 1 concentration value was reported. PK Parameter Set: All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and who took at least 1 dose of study intervention and in whom at least 1 of the PK parameters of interest were reported. Safety: Safety Analysis Set: All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and who took at least 1 dose of study intervention. Participants were analyzed according to the product they actually received. Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints Abbreviations: AE = adverse event, AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 inf extrapolated to infinity, AUC = area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to the time of last the last quantifiable concentration, BA = bioavailability, CL/F = apparent clearance, C = maximum plasma max concentration, ECG = electrocardiogram, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event, t = terminal half-life, ½ T = time for C , V /F = apparent volume of distribution. max max z Methodology: The study was conducted as a Phase 1, open-label, single dose, randomized, 3-period, cross-over design in a single cohort of approximately 12 healthy male or female participants at a single center. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): Approximately 12 healthy male and/or female participants were planned to be randomized into 1 of 2 sequences. A total of 12 participants were assigned to the study. All participants received study intervention and completed the study. Per protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP), all participants were included in the PK and safety analysis sets. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Healthy adult participants were enrolled in this study. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): Participants were planned to be randomized into 2 sequences of treatment as described in Table S2. The manufacturing lot numbers for the study interventions dispensed in this study are provided in Table S3. Participants were screened within 28 days of the first dose of study intervention. In all periods, participants underwent serial blood sample collection for 24 hours postdosing to characterize the PK profile of ritlecitinib. A taste assessment was conducted using a taste assessment questionnaire for the spray congealed beads in Period 3, immediately after dosing, and at 5 min, 10 min, 20 min after dosing. Table S3.

Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: All participants were between the ages of 23-56 years. Most of the participants were male (10 out of 12 participants). Exposure: The duration of treatment was 1 day (Study Days 1, 3 and 5) for all participants in each of the 3 treatment periods. Safety Results: None of the TEAEs were treatment-related. No participant had an SAE, severe AE, dose reduction, permanent or temporary discontinuation due to AEs. All TEAEs were mild in severity. The System Organ Classes with participants reporting all-causality TEAEs across all treatments were General disorders and administration site conditions (3 events reported by 3 participants; 2 receiving ritlecitinib 30 mg intact adult capsule and 1 receiving ritlecitinib 30 mg spray congealed beads), and Nervous system disorders (2 events reported by 1 participant receiving the ritlecitinib 3 × 10 mg pediatric capsules). None of the lab abnormalities were considered by the Principal Investigator as AEs. No clinically meaningful findings in the vital signs measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examination assessments, or other observations related to safety were observed in this study. Pharmacokinetic Results: The time to reach maximum plasma concentrations following single oral doses of ritlecitinib hours for the 30 mg intact adult capsules, 3 × 10 mg pediatric capsules, and the 30 mg spray congealed beads, respectively. Overall, the PK parameters between the 3 formulations appeared similar with similar geometric mean values for t , CL/F and V /F following single ½ z oral doses. Results of the statistical analysis showed similar exposures between the 3 treatments. For 3 × 10 mg pediatric capsules formulation of ritlecitinib relative to 30 mg intact adult capsules, the Test/Reference ratios (90% confidence interval [CI]) of adjusted geometric means of AUC and C values were 102.50% (94.21%, 111.51%) and 101.12% (88.25%, inf max 115.87%), respectively. Similarly, the 30 mg spray congealed beads formulation of ritlecitinib relative to 30 mg intact adult capsules the Test/Reference ratios (90% CI) of adjusted geometric means of AUC and C were 106.65% (100.07%, 113.66%) and inf max 90.11% (78.49%, 103.44%), respectively. Taste Assessment: Responses to the taste assessment questionnaire that document overall liking, mouth feel, bitterness, sourness, saltiness and tongue/mouth burn of sensory attributes were collected. All of the taste sensory attributes improved over time. Conclusions: PK:  In comparison to adult capsule formulation of ritlecitinib, both 3 × 10 mg pediatric capsules formulation and 30 mg spray congealed beads formulation had similar exposures based on geometric mean AUC , AUC and C values. For 3 × 10 mg inf last max pediatric capsules formulation of ritlecitinib, relative to 30 mg intact adult capsules, the Test/Reference ratios (90% CI) of adjusted geometric means of AUC and C values inf max were 102.50% (94.21%, 111.51%) and 101.12% (88.25%, 115.87%), respectively. Similarly, for 30 mg spray congealed beads formulation of ritlecitinib relative to 30 mg intact adult capsules, the Test/Reference ratios (90% CI) of adjusted geometric means of AUC and C were 106.65% (100.07%, 113.66%) and 90.11% (78.49%, 103.44%), inf max respectively.  The T , t , CL/F, and V /F values were similar following single doses of 30 mg intact max ½ z adult capsules, 3 × 10 mg pediatric capsules, and 30 mg spray congealed beads. Safety:  The 10 mg capsules, 30 mg capsules and spray congealed beads at the 30 mg dose of ritlecitinib were safe and well tolerated in healthy adult participants. Taste Assessment:  The taste of ritlecitinib 30 mg spray congealed beads was acceptable in healthy adult
