Study Initiation Date and Primary Completion or Final Completion Dates: Study Initiation Date: 20 December 2016 Final Completion Date: 12 December 2017 Phase of Development: Phase 2a Study Objective(s): Primary Objective:  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06651600 at 8 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate the safety of PF-06651600.  To assess other signs of clinical efficacy over 8 weeks.  To assess the effect of PF-06651600 on patient reported outcome measurements. Study Design: This was a Phase 2a, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety profile of PF-06651600 in seropositive subjects with moderate to severe active RA with an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) (up to approximately 50% of subjects may have also had an inadequate response to 1 anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF] biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug [DMARD]). Up to approximately 60 subjects were randomized globally into the study to ensure at least approximately 50 subjects completed 8 weeks of active dosing (assuming a dropout rate of approximately 15%). Subjects participated in this study for approximately 17 weeks. This included an up to 5-week screening period, an 8-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period (Figure 1). Figure 1.

The study was planned to enroll approximately 50 completers. A total of 155 subjects were screened, and 70 subjects were randomized to study treatment from 32 centers in 9 countries (Bulgaria [15 subjects], Czech Republic [1 subject], Georgia [20 subjects], Germany [2 subjects], Hungary [0 subjects], Poland [7 subjects], Serbia [14 subjects], Slovakia [6 subjects], and United States [5 subjects]). All 70 subjects received at least 1 dose of study treatment and were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis set (SAF): 28 subjects received placebo and 42 subjects received PF-06651600. Of the 70 subjects who were randomized and treated, 59 subjects (84.3%) completed the study and 11 subjects (15.7%) discontinued from the study in the double-blind treatment. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Eligible subjects included male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 years (inclusive), had the diagnosis of RA and met the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria, met Class I, II, or III of the ACR 1991 Revised Criteria for the classification of Global Functional Status in RA, had active disease at both screening and baseline, were seropositive (rheumatoid factor positive and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibody positive) at the screening visit, and took oral MTX for at least 3 months at an adequate dose to determine that the subject had an inadequate response to MTX. Ineligible subjects included subjects with any major illness/condition(s) or evidence of an unstable clinical condition (eg, renal, hepatic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary or local active infection/infectious illness) that, in the investigator’s judgment would have substantially increased the risk to the subject if he or she participated in the study, acute coronary syndrome (eg, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris) and any history of cerebrovascular disease within 24 weeks before screening or in the period between the Screening Visit and the Baseline Visit, and subjects with a known immunodeficiency disorder or a first degree relative with a hereditary immunodeficiency. Study Treatment: Eligible subjects were randomized to receive 200 mg QD of PF-06651600 or placebo (matching tablets for PF-06651600 QD) every day for 8 weeks in a blinded fashion. Blinded PF-06651600 and its matching placebo were provided as tablets in blister cards for oral administration. The PF-06651600 50 mg tablets and their matching placebos were supplied in separate blister cards and labeled according to local regulatory requirements. Efficacy Endpoints: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change from baseline in Simple Disease Activity Index (SDAI) at Week 8. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  Safety and tolerability of PF-06651600 versus placebo; vital signs, laboratory tests,  Change from baseline in SDAI low disease activity scale (LDAS) and remission rates at Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8.  Change from baseline in disease activity score 28 (DAS28) LDAS and remission rates at Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8.  Change from baseline for components of SDAI score: Tender/Painful Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC), physician’s global assessment (PhGA) of arthritis, patient’s global assessment (PtGA) of arthritis, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.  Change from baseline in DAS28-3 (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), DAS28-3 (C-reactive protein [CRP]), DAS28-4 (ESR), and DAS28-4 (CRP) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.  Change from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Safety Evaluations: Safety was assessed by the spontaneous reporting of AEs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory results in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product. Investigators and Pfizer clinician/medical monitor reviewed individual subject data throughout the conduct of the trial to ensure subjects’ well-being. Statistical Methods: Primary Analysis: The primary analysis was conducted on SDAI change from baseline at 8 weeks. Analysis included data on PF-06651600 and placebo arms. Analysis of the primary endpoint was based on intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The primary analysis was conducted in Bayesian analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) framework. The model included baseline SDAI score as a covariate. The primary analysis model used an informative prior distribution for placebo derived from the historic Tofacitinib data after adjusting for, observed in current study, baseline SDAI score and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) status. The prior model for placebo assumed that placebo mean followed a normal distribution with mean = -13.7 and variance = 25. Noninformative prior models were used for the active arm and all other model parameters. Sensitivity Analysis: Multiple alternative sensitivity prior models were considered for the prior mean of the placebo distribution. The main sensitivity analysis was conducted using noninformative variance modeled using t distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. A longitudinal analysis of SDAI score with missing data imputations was conducted as well. Secondary Analysis: SDAI: Analysis of number of subjects with SDAI remission (SDAI 3.3) and SDAI low disease activity (SDAI 11) at Weeks 4, 6, and 8:  ITT population set  Missing data imputation  Observed  Non-responder imputation (NRI)  Normal approximation Analysis of change from baseline in SDAI at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8:  ITT population set  Missing data imputation – none (observed)  Mixed effect model repeat measurement (MMRM) Disease activity score (DAS): For DAS28-3 (ESR), DAS28-3 (CRP), DAS28-4 (ESR), and DAS28-4 (CRP), analysis of number of subject with DAS28 remission (DAS <2.6) and DAS28 low disease activity (DAS28 <3.2) at Weeks 4, 6, and 8:  ITT population set  Missing data imputation  Observed  NRI  Normal approximation DAS28-4 (CRP) SDAI at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8:  ITT population set  Missing data imputation – none (observed)  MMRM hsCRP: Analysis of change from baseline in hsCRP at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8:  ITT population set  Missing data imputation – none (observed)  MMRM TJC and SJC: Analysis of change from baseline in the TJC and SJC (28) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8:  ITT population set  Missing data imputation – none (observed)  MMRM PhGA of Arthritis: Analysis of change from baseline in PhGA of arthritis at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8:  ITT population set  Missing data imputation – none (observed)  MMRM Patient outcomes research (PRO) Endpoints: Analysis of change from baseline in for outcomes research endpoints at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8:  Endpoints are patient assessment of arthritis pain (PAAP) visual analog scale (VAS), PtGA VAS, and HAQ-DI  ITT population set  MMRM Safety Analysis:  Safety data were presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate. All safety endpoints were listed and summarized in accordance with Pfizer Data Standards. Categorical outcomes (eg, AEs) were summarized by subject counts and percentage. Continuous outcome (eg, blood pressure [BP], pulse rate, etc.) were summarized using N, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), etc. Change from baseline in laboratory data, ECGs, and vital signs were also summarized. Subject listings were produced for these safety endpoints accordingly. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition is summarized in Table 2.

Efficacy Results: Primary Endpoint: Change From Baseline in SDAI at Week 8: Bayesian ANCOVA analysis results for Week 8 SDAI change from baseline adjusted for baseline SDAI (ITT population) are summarized in Table 4. PF-06651600 met the primary endpoint with a mean change from baseline in SDAI at Week 8 of -26.05 (95% CI: -29.67, -22.44) compared to placebo mean change from baseline of -16.80 (95% CI: -20.90, -12.68) with a placebo-adjusted difference of -9.25 (95% CI: -14.75, -3.79) (p <0.001).

Baseline is defined to be the latest non-missing value from pre-treatment period. Intent-To-Treat (ITT) analysis set will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the investigational drug. Sensitivity estimates: estimates obtained using noninformative prior model for placebo (no placebo information borrowing from historic data). SDAI baseline (mean adjusted): baseline SDAI is included in the model as a covariate and is mean adjusted (ie, centered to 0 by subtraction of the observed baseline mean from all values). ANCOVA = analysis of covariance; HPD CI = high posterior density confidence interval; ITT = intent-to-treat; Pr = probability; QD = once daily; SDAI = simple disease activity index. Sensitivity/Robustness Analyses: The sensitivity analyses performed for the Week 8 differences in SDAI were in line with the primary results. The sensitivity models consistently estimated the adjusted treatment effect and provided evidence of statistically significant treatment effect:  Bayesian ANCOVA with non-informative placebo prior distribution (no borrowing from historic placebo) confirmed significant evidence of treatment effect at Week 8 (p = 0.0023) in agreement with the primary analysis (Table 4).  Parametric ANCOVA (using only Week 8 endpoint) and MMRM model which included all SDAI time points (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8) and all randomized subjects were consistent with the primary analysis results.  Two (2) modifications to the primary analysis population, 1 to exclude 5 subjects who did not meet Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and 1 to exclude the 4 subjects who did not complete the Week 8 visit produced similar estimates of the treatment effect and its statistical significance. Change From Baseline in SDAI at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8: The descriptive summary of change from baseline for SDAI at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 is presented in Table 5. Analysis of change from baseline in SDAI longitudinal data showed statistical separation from the placebo was achieved at Week 6 and was sustained through Week 8. The longitudinal analysis of change from baseline of SDAI components showed improvement trends for the SDAI components throughout the 8-week dosing period. Table 5.

Safety Results: There were no deaths in the study. A total of 25 (35.7%) subjects experienced 36 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), among which 12 events reported by 10 (14.3%) subjects were considered treatment-related. No subjects experienced treatment-emergent SAEs or severe TEAEs. The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity (Table 21). A total of 3 (4.3%) subjects discontinued due to TEAEs. Two (2 [2.9%]) subjects experienced dose reduction or had temporary discontinuation due to TEAEs. The most common TEAEs by system organ class were Infections and Infestations (6 subjects in total, 8.6%) and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (6 subjects in total, 8.6%). There was 1 mild case of herpes simplex in the PF-06651600 group that was considered to be treatment-related with no cases in the placebo group. PF-00651600 treatment group than the placebo, as was the number of subjects who discontinued due to TEAEs or temporarily discontinued due to TEAEs. Table 21.

Subjects are counted only once per treatment per event. For the TESS algorithm any missing severities have been imputed as severe unless the subject experienced another occurrence of the same event in a given treatment for which severity was recorded. In this case, the reported severity was summarized. Missing baseline severities are imputed as mild. Treatment column gives study treatment at time of AE. Without regard to baseline abnormality, 70 (100%) of the 70 treated subjects experienced laboratory abnormalities (Table 22). Overall, the most frequently occurring laboratory abnormality was ESR, reported by 68 (97.1%) subjects. By the Week 8 time point, in the PF-06651600 group, there were decreases in the median platelet counts (25% change from baseline), lymphocyte counts (21% change from baseline), neutrophil counts (24% change from baseline), and hemoglobin (3% change from baseline).

Bayesian ANCOVA with non-informative placebo prior distribution (no borrowing from historic placebo) confirmed significant evidence of treatment effect at Week 8 (p = 0.0023). Parametric ANCOVA (using only Week 8 endpoint) and MMRM model which included all SDAI time points (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8) and all randomized subjects were consistent with the primary analysis results. Two (2) modifications to the primary analysis population, 1 to exclude 5 subjects who did not meet Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and 1 to exclude the 4 subjects who did not complete the Week 8 visit produced similar estimates of the treatment effect and its statistical significance.  Analysis of change from baseline in SDAI longitudinal data showed statistical separation from placebo was achieved at Week 6 and was sustained through Week 8.  A significant difference of rate of subjects with SDAI LDAS (SDAI 11) by visit was observed with the NRI method at Week 8 (PF-06651600: 23.8%, placebo: 7.1%, p = 0.0416).  A significant difference in total number of tender joints was observed compared to placebo at Week 8. A significant difference in the total number of swollen joints was not observed. For the change from baseline for PhGA, statistically significant difference from placebo was observed for the PF-06651600 treatment group at Week 6. Statistically significant differences were not observed for the change from baseline for HAQ-DI.  PF-06651600 was determined to be generally safe and well tolerated in this study. There were no deaths or SAEs. TEAEs were numerically higher in subjects receiving PF-06651600 compared to those receiving placebo.  The most common TEAEs by SOC were Infections and Infestations (6 subjects in total, 8.6%) and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (6 subjects in total, 8.6%). The majority of the AEs were mild in severity.  There was 1 mild case of herpes simplex in the PF-06651600 group that was considered to be treatment-related with no cases in the placebo group. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs, ECG, or audiometric assessments.  By the Week 8 time point (as early as 2 weeks), in the PF-06651600 group, there were decreases in the median platelet counts (25% change from baseline), lymphocyte counts (21% change from baseline), neutrophil counts (24% change from baseline), and hemoglobin (3% change from baseline). None of these were deemed to be clinically follow-up visit.
