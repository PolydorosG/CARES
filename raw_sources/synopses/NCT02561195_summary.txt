VACCINE NAME AND/OR COMPOUND NUMBER Clostridium difficile Vaccine, Compound Number: PF-06425090 PROTOCOL NO.: B5091009 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Phase 2, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Observer-Blinded Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Two 3-Dose Regimens of a Clostridium difficile Vaccine in Healthy Adults Aged 65 to 85 Years Study Center(s): This study was conducted at 15 sites in the United States of America Study Initiation Date and Primary Completion or Final Completion Dates: Study Initiation Date = 16 July 2015 Final Completion Date = 07 March 2017 Phase of Development: Phase 2 Study Objective(s): In this Public Disclosure Synopsis (PDS), results for the study objectives related to the original planned stage (3 vaccine doses and follow-up through 12 months after Dose 3) of the study are presented. Results for the secondary immunogenicity objectives and secondary safety objectives related to the fourth vaccine dose (extension stage) will be presented in a supplemental PDS when all extension-stage immunogenicity and safety data up to Visit 17 (36 months after Dose 4) are available for subjects who entered the extension stage. Primary Immunogenicity Objectives The primary immunogenicity objectives were as follows:  To describe the immunogenicity of 2 antigen dose levels (100 µg and 200 µg total toxoid) of C difficile vaccine when administered as a 3-dose regimen (Days 1, 8, and 30) to healthy adults aged 65 to 85 years, as measured by C difficile toxin A– and toxin B– specific neutralizing antibody levels at Day 37 (7 days after Dose 3).  To describe the immunogenicity of 2 antigen dose levels (100 µg and 200 µg total toxoid) of C difficile vaccine when administered as a 3-dose regimen (Months 0, 1, and 6) to healthy adults aged 65 to 85 years, as measured by C difficile toxin A– and toxin B– specific neutralizing antibody levels at Month 7 (1 month after Dose 3). The primary safety objective was as follows:  To assess the safety and tolerability of 2 antigen dose levels (100 µg and 200 µg total toxoid) of C difficile vaccine when administered as a 3-dose regimen (either Days 1, 8, and 30 or Months 0, 1, and 6) to healthy adults aged 65 to 85 years, by measuring local reactions and systemic events reported on subjects’ electronic diaries (e-diaries), adverse events (AEs), and serious AEs (SAEs). Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives The secondary immunogenicity objectives were as follows:  To describe the immunogenicity of 2 antigen dose levels (100 µg and 200 µg total toxoid) of C difficile vaccine when administered in a 3-dose regimen (either Days 1, 8, and 30 or Months 0, 1, and 6) to healthy adults aged 65 to 85 years, as measured by C difficile toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels at multiple time points following vaccination.  To describe the kinetics of the immune response in healthy adults aged 65 to 85 years for up to 12 months following the administration of 3 doses of C difficile vaccine.  To describe the immunogenicity of a fourth dose of C difficile vaccine as measured by C difficile toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels at multiple time points following vaccination.  To describe the kinetics of the immune response in healthy adults aged 65 to 85 years for up to 36 months following the administration of a fourth dose of C difficile vaccine. Secondary Safety Objective The secondary safety objective was as follows:  To assess the safety and tolerability of a fourth dose of C difficile vaccine by measuring local reactions and systemic events reported on subjects’ e-diaries, AEs, and SAEs. METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 2, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blinded study to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 antigen dose levels (100 µg and 200 µg total toxoid) of aluminum hydroxide–containing C difficile vaccine administered as a 3-dose regimen: either at Days 1, 8, and 30 (day regimen) or Months 0, 1, and 6 (month regimen). Study subjects and investigators were blinded to their allocated vaccine group during the vaccination period of the study. Following the third interim analysis (when Month 7 data who received the first 3 doses of C difficile vaccine (100 µg or 200 µg) were asked to enter an extension stage and were rerandomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive C difficile vaccine or placebo. During the blinded part of the study, the investigator, study coordinator, and any site staff other than the unblinded dispenser/administrator were not allowed to know the investigational product assigned to any study subject and were not allowed to see the investigational product container contents. Those study team members who were involved in ensuring that protocol requirements for investigational product handling, allocation, and administration were fulfilled at the site were unblinded for the duration of the study. All other study team members remained blinded to vaccine assigned/received at Doses 1, 2, and 3 until the third interim analysis. Those study team members will also be blinded to vaccine assigned in the extension stage until Visit 12 (6 months after the fourth dose). Laboratory staff who performed the immunogenicity testing were blinded throughout the study. Approximately 854 healthy adults, aged 65 to 85 years, were planned to be enrolled at approximately 15 sites in the USA. The number of subjects enrolled at each site could vary based on enrollment capabilities of each site. At each site, subjects were planned to be only enrolled into 1 of the 2 dosing regiments (either the month regimen or the day regimen). Subjects were assigned to 1 of the 2 dosing regimens and then randomly assigned in parallel in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive C difficile vaccine (100 µg or 200 µg) or placebo (saline) (Table 1). Table 1. Vaccine Groups and Planned Number of Subjects per Group and per Dose Regimen a. Subjects in these groups were asked to enter the extension stage. For the original planned stage of the study, subjects were followed for 12 months after receipt of their third vaccination. Therefore, subjects assigned to the day regimen participated for approximately 13 months and those assigned to the month regimen participated for approximately 18 months. Subjects withdrawn from the study after randomization were not replaced, regardless of the reason for withdrawal. for subjects on the day regimen and Month 18 for subjects on the month regimen) and all immunogenicity and safety data up to and including Visit 9 were available. This PDS presents results for the original planned stage of the study. Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): Four hundred twenty-seven (427) subjects were randomized to the month regimen (183 subjects each in both the 100-g and 200-g C difficile groups and 61 subjects in the placebo group). The majority (85.0%) of subjects enrolled in the month regimen completed the original planned stage of the study (ie, 12 months of follow-up after the third vaccination). In addition, 100.0%, 96.5%, and 89.7% of subjects were vaccinated with Doses 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Four hundred twenty-eight (428) subjects were randomized to the day regimen (183 subjects in the 100-g C difficile group, 184 subjects in the 200-g C difficile group, and 61 subjects in the placebo group). The majority (88.1%) of subjects enrolled in the day regimen completed the original planned stage of the study (ie, 12 months of follow-up after the third vaccination). In addition, 99.8%, 97.4%, and 94.4% of subjects were vaccinated with Doses 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: The study included healthy males and females, aged 65 to 85 years, with no previous administration of an investigational C difficile vaccine or C difficile monoclonal antibody therapy, and no proven or suspected prior episode of C difficile infection, who were not immunocompromised. Study Treatment or Study Vaccine: Clostridium difficile Vaccine The investigational C difficile vaccine is composed of 2 toxoids (A and B) in equal amounts. The vaccine was provided as a sterile lyophilized powder at dosage strengths of 100 g and 200 g of toxoids A and B combined per dose. The vaccine was prepared for injection by resuspending the lyophilized vaccine with aluminum hydroxide diluent immediately before use. The aluminum hydroxide diluent was supplied as a 1-mg aluminum per mL (as aluminum hydroxide) liquid suspension. Placebo Saline (0.9% sodium chloride) was administered as the investigational product placebo. A sterile solution for injection from a commercially available source was used to that effect.

Safety Endpoints  Numbers and proportions of subjects reporting local reactions (pain, redness, and swelling) and their severity, as self-reported on e-diaries for up to 14 days following Doses 1, 2, and 3.  Numbers and proportions of subjects reporting systemic events (fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, new or worsening muscle pain, and new or worsening joint pain) and their severity, as self-reported on e-diaries for up to 14 days following Doses 1, 2, and 3. 28 days after the third vaccination, categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Numbers and proportions of subjects reporting SAEs from the first vaccination until 6 months after the third vaccination, categorized according to MedDRA. Safety Evaluations: The safety parameters assessed included:  Acute reactions (recorded as immediate AEs) within the first 30 minutes after investigational product administration.  Prompted e-diary reactogenicity, including local reactions and systemic events that occurred in the 14 days (or 7 days for the first vaccination for subjects on the day regimen) after investigational product administration.  AEs, SAEs, and newly diagnosed chronic medical disorders. The grading scales used in this study to assess local reactions, systemic events, and fever assessments as described below were derived from the Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research guidelines on toxicity grading scales for healthy adult volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical studies. Statistical Methods: For the immunogenicity analyses, an evaluable immunogenicity population and a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population were defined separately for each regimen. The evaluable immunogenicity population was the primary immunogenicity population. The immunogenicity data were summarized according to the vaccine group as randomly assigned. The definitions of these populations are as follows: Evaluable Immunogenicity Population For each vaccination regimen, the evaluable immunogenicity population was defined separately. For the day regimen, the evaluable immunogenicity population in the original planned stage included all subjects who: 1. Were eligible for the study at randomization. 2. Received all 3 study vaccinations for the vaccine formulations to which they were randomized. vaccination at Day 30 (Dose 3 at Visit 4) and the sample from this blood draw provided at least 1 valid and determinate assay result. 4. Had no major protocol violations as determined by the study clinician. For the month regimen, the evaluable immunogenicity population in the original planned stage included all subjects who: 1. Were eligible for the study at randomization. 2. Received all 3 study vaccinations for the vaccine formulations to which they were randomized. 3. Had blood drawn for assay testing at Month 7 (Visit 7) within 20 to 45 days after the vaccination at Month 6 (Dose 3 at Visit 5) and the sample from this blood draw provided at least 1 valid and determinate assay result. 4. Had no major protocol violations as determined by the study clinician. Modified Intent-to-Treat Population For each vaccination regimen, the mITT population in the original planned stage included all subjects randomized in the original planned stage who had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result for the proposed analysis. The mITT population was the secondary immunogenicity population. For the mITT population, results are summarized according to the vaccine group as randomly assigned. Safety Population For each regimen, the safety population included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of an investigational product. Statistical Methods Immunogenicity Analyses The C difficile toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels at each blood sampling time point were summarized by GMCs and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each vaccine group. Clopper-Pearson exact 2-sided 95% CIs were provided for each vaccine group and sampling time point for immunogenicity endpoints regarding the proportions of subjects with toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody titers above or equal to the specified thresholds, and with specified fold rise changes from baseline in toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels. All safety data were summarized based on the safety population in accordance with Pfizer reporting standards. All safety summaries were provided separately for each assigned dosing regimen (Days 1, 8, and 30 and Months 0, 1, and 6). Clopper-Pearson exact 2-sided 95% CIs were provided by vaccine group for all primary safety endpoints, and the proportions of subjects reporting local reactions, systemic events, and AEs (including AEs occurring within the first 30 minutes after each vaccination).

For toxin A, at Month 7 in the month regimen, 160 (98.2%) subjects (95% CI: 94.7%; 99.6%) in the 100-g C difficile group and 151 (95.6%) subjects (95% CI: 91.1%; 98.2%) in the 200-g C difficile group achieved the specified threshold, compared with 1 subject (95% CI: 0.0%; 10.1%) in the placebo group (Table 5). For toxin B, at Month 7 in the month regimen, 122 (74.8%) subjects (95% CI: 67.5%; 81.3%) in the 100-g C difficile group and 138 (87.3%) subjects (95% CI: 81.1%; 92.1%) in the 200-g C difficile group achieved the specified threshold, compared with 4 (7.5%) subjects (95% CI: 2.1%; 18.2%) in the placebo group (Table 5). For both toxin A and toxin B, at Month 7 in the month regimen, 121 (74.2%) subjects (95% CI: 66.8%; 80.8%) in the 100-g C difficile group and 136 (86.1%) subjects (95% CI: 79.7%; 91.1%) in the 200-g C difficile group achieved the specified threshold, compared with no subjects (95% CI: 0.0%; 6.7%) in the placebo group (Table 5). Day Regimen For toxin A, at Day 37 in the day regimen, 117 (68.4%) subjects (95% CI: 60.9%; 75.3%) in the 100-g C difficile group and 141 (85.5%) subjects (95% CI: 79.1%; 90.5%) in the 200-g C difficile group achieved the specified threshold, compared with 7 (12.5%) subjects (95% CI: 5.2%; 24.1%) in the placebo group (Table 6). For toxin B, at Day 37 in the day regimen, 51 (29.8%) subjects (95% CI: 23.1%; 37.3%) in the 100-g C difficile group and 64 (38.8%) subjects (95% CI: 31.3%; 46.7%) in the 200-g C difficile group achieved the specified threshold, compared with 1 subject (95% CI: 0.0%; 9.6%) in the placebo group (Table 6). For both toxin A and toxin B, at Day 37 in the day regimen, 45 (26.3%) subjects (95% CI: 19.9%; 33.6%) in the 100-g C difficile group and 64 (38.8%) subjects (95% CI: 31.3%; 46.7%) in the 200-g C difficile group achieved the specified threshold, compared with no subjects (95% CI: 0.0%; 6.4%) in the placebo group (Table 6). Secondary Immunogenicity Results Proportions of Subjects Achieving Toxin A–, Toxin B–, and Both Toxin A– and Toxin B–Specific Neutralizing Antibody Titers  Specified Threshold Values Month Regimen In the month regimen, 1 subject in the 100-g C difficile group, 2 (1.3%) subjects in the 200-g C difficile group, and 1 subject in the placebo group had toxin A–specific neutralizing antibody levels  the specified threshold at baseline. After Doses 1 and 2 but prior to Dose 3, the proportions of subjects achieving the toxin A–specific threshold value were limited, with 71 (43.6%) subjects (95% CI: 35.8%; 51.5%) in the 100-g C difficile Day 187. For the 100-g C difficile group at Month 7, 160 (98.2%) subjects achieved the toxin A–specific threshold value and the proportion of subjects achieving the threshold value decreased to 75 (48.7%) subjects at Month 18. For the 200-g C difficile group at Month 7, 151 (95.6%) subjects achieved the toxin A–specific threshold value and the proportion of subjects achieving this threshold value decreased to 81 (53.3%) subjects at Month 18 (Table 5). In the month regimen, 4 (2.5%) subjects in the 100-g C difficile group, 7 (4.4%) subjects in the 200-g C difficile group, and 2 (3.8%) subjects in the placebo group had toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels  the specified threshold at baseline. After Doses 1 and 2 but prior to Dose 3, 47 (28.8%) subjects (95% CI: 22.0%; 36.4%) in the 100-g C difficile group achieved the threshold value at Day 37 and at Month 2, and 60 (38.2%) subjects (95% CI: 30.6%; 46.3%) in the 200-g C difficile group achieved the threshold value at Day 37. After Dose 3, the proportions of subjects achieving this threshold value increased at Day 187. For the 100-g C difficile group at Month 7, 122 (74.8%) subjects achieved the toxin B–specific threshold value and the proportion of subjects achieving the threshold value decreased to 53 (34.4%) subjects at Month 18. For the 200-g C difficile group at Month 7, 138 (87.3%) subjects achieved the toxin B–specific threshold value and the proportion of subjects achieving this threshold value decreased to 72 (47.4%) subjects at Month 18 (Table 5). Overall, results for the proportions of subjects achieving both toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels  the specified thresholds were similar to those of toxin B (Table 5).

Between Day 8 and Month 13, toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody GMFRs were higher for the 200-g C difficile group compared with the 100-g C difficile group. Toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody GMFRs for the mITT population were similar to those of the evaluable immunogenicity population. Proportions of Subjects Achieving Defined Fold Rises From Baseline in Toxin A–, Toxin B–, and Both Toxin A– and Toxin B–Specific Neutralizing Antibody Levels Month Regimen Overall, greater proportions of subjects achieving defined fold rises from baseline toxin A– specific neutralizing antibody levels were observed for the 200-g C difficile group compared with the 100-g C difficile group. For the 100-g C difficile group, increases in proportions of subjects reaching a 4-fold rise were observed from Day 37, with 125 (76.7%) subjects reaching a 8-fold rise at Month 7. For the 100-g C difficile group, 77 (47.2%) subjects reached a 16-fold rise and 33 (20.2%) subjects reached a 32-fold rise in toxin A–specific neutralizing antibody levels at Month 7. For the 200-g C difficile group, increases in proportions of subjects reaching a 4-fold rise were observed from Day 37, with a marked increase in the proportion of subjects reaching a 8-fold rise at Day 187 (88 [55.7%] subjects). For the 200-g C difficile group, 89 (56.3%) subjects reached a 16-fold rise and 34 (21.5%) subjects reached a 32-fold rise in toxin A–specific neutralizing antibody levels at Month 7. Overall, greater proportions of subjects achieving defined fold rises from baseline toxin B– specific neutralizing antibody levels were observed for the 200-g C difficile group compared with the 100-g C difficile group. For the 100-g C difficile group, increases in proportions of subjects reaching a 4-fold rise were observed from Day 37, with 138 (84.7%) subjects reaching a 8-fold rise at Month 7. For the 100-g C difficile group, 85 (52.5%) subjects reached a 16-fold and 52 (32.1%) subjects reached a 32-fold rise in toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels at Day 187. For the 200-g C difficile group, increases in proportions of subjects reaching a 4-fold rise were observed from Day 187, with marked increases in the proportions of subjects reaching a 8-fold rise at Day 187 (124 [78.5%] subjects). For the 200-g C difficile group, 105 (66.5%) subjects in the 200-g C difficile group reached a 32-fold rise in toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels at Month 7. Overall, results for the proportions of subjects achieving defined fold rises from baseline for both toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels were similar to those of and both toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels for the mITT population were similar to those of the evaluable immunogenicity population. Day Regimen Overall, greater proportions of subjects achieving defined fold rises from baseline toxin A– specific neutralizing antibody levels were observed for the 200-g C difficile group compared with the 100-g C difficile group. For the 100-g C difficile group, increases in proportions of subjects reaching a 4-fold rise were observed from Day 15, with 43 (25.1%) subjects reaching a 8-fold rise at Day 37. For the 100-g C difficile group, 15 (8.8%) subjects reached a 16-fold rise and 6 (3.5%) subjects reached a 32-fold rise in toxin A–specific neutralizing antibody levels at Day 37. For the 200-g C difficile group, increases in proportions of subjects reaching a 4-fold rise were observed from Day 15, with a marked increase in the proportion of subjects (67 [40.9%]) reaching a 8-fold rise at Day 37. For the 200-g C difficile group, 23 (14.1%) subjects reached a 16-fold rise and 15 (9.2%) subjects reached a 32-fold rise in toxin A–specific neutralizing antibody levels at Day 15. Overall, similar proportions of subjects achieving defined fold rises from baseline toxin B– specific neutralizing antibody levels were observed for the 100-g and 200-g C difficile groups up to Month 4. At Months 7 and 13, greater proportions of subjects achieving defined fold rises from baseline toxin A–specific neutralizing antibody levels were observed for the 200-g C difficile group compared with the 100-g C difficile group. For the 100-g C difficile group, increases in proportions of subjects reaching a 4-fold rise were observed from Day 15, with 57 (33.3%) subjects reaching a 8-fold rise at Day 15 and Day 30. For the 100-g C difficile group, 45 (26.3%) subjects reached a 16-fold rise and 35 (20.5%) subjects reached a 32-fold rise in toxin A–specific neutralizing antibody levels at Day 15. For the 200-g C difficile group, increases in proportions of subjects reaching a 4-fold rise were observed from Day 15, with a marked increase in the proportion of subjects (66 [40.2%]) reaching a 8-fold rise at Day 37. For the 200-g C difficile group, 61 (37.4%) subjects reached a 16-fold rise and 45 (27.4%) subjects reached a 32-fold rise in toxin A–specific neutralizing antibody levels at Day 30 and Day 37. Overall, results for the proportions of subjects achieving defined fold rises from baseline for both toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels were similar to those of toxin A. The proportions of subjects achieving defined fold rises from baseline in toxin A–, toxin B–, and both toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels for the mITT population were similar to those of the evaluable immunogenicity population.

MedDRA (v20.0) coding dictionary applied. Month Regimen Non-serious AEs are presented by SOC and preferred term for the month regimen in Table 13. For the month regimen, non-serious AEs were reported by 154 (84.2%) subjects in the 100-g C difficile group, 153 (83.6%) subjects in the 200-g C difficile group, and 52 (85.2%) subjects in the placebo group. Infections and infestations was the most common SOC. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and injury, poisoning and procedural complications were the next most common SOCs. The most frequently reported individual non-serious AEs were upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, viral upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and arthralgia. The majority of non-serious AEs were each reported by only 1 or 2 subjects in the study (Table 13). Nineteen (19) related non-serious AEs were reported in the 100-g C difficile group, 11 related non-serious AEs were reported in the 200-g C difficile group, and 2 related non- serious AEs were reported in the placebo group. Injection site nodule was the most frequent related non-serious AE reported with 4 events in the 100-g C difficile group and 2 events in the 200-g C difficile group. Diarrhea (3 events in the 100-g C difficile group and 1 event in the 200-g C difficile group) and injection site swelling (1 event in the 100-g C difficile group and 2 events in the 200-g C difficile group) were the next most common related non- serious AEs. All other related non-serious AEs were each reported by only 1 or 2 subjects in the study (Table 13). Table 13.

For the day regimen, non-serious AEs were reported by 122 (67.0%) subjects in the 100-g C difficile group, 138 (75.0%) subjects in the 200-g C difficile group, and 38 (62.3%) subjects in the placebo group. General disorders and administration site conditions was the most common SOC. Infections and infestations and injury, poisoning and procedural complications were the next most common SOCs. The most frequently reported individual non-serious AEs were injection site hemorrhage, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and arthralgia. The majority of non-serious AEs were each reported by only 1 or 2 subjects in the study (Table 14). Twenty (20) related non-serious AEs were reported in the 100-g C difficile group, 22 related non-serious AEs were reported in the 200-g C difficile group, and 2 related non- serious AEs were reported in the placebo group. Injection site hemorrhage was the most frequent related non-serious AE reported with 8 events in the 100-g C difficile group and 9 events in the 200-g C difficile group. Injection site pain (5 events in the 100-g C difficile group and 1 event in the placebo group), injection site erythema (1 event in the 100-g C difficile group and 3 events in the 200-g C difficile group), and injection site pruritus (1 event in the 100-g C difficile group and 2 events in the 200-g C difficile group) were the next most common related non-serious AEs. All other related non-serious AEs were each reported by only 1 or 2 subjects in the study (Table 14). Table 14.

Day Regimen For the day regimen, 1 subject in the 100-g C difficile group (rash) and 5 (2.7%) subjects in the 200-g C difficile group (dyspnea, injection site rash, injection site swelling, injection site macule, and pruritic rash) were withdrawn from the study because of AEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to investigational product. A further 3 (1.6%) subjects in the 100-g C difficile group (prostate cancer, C difficile colitis, fall, and metabolic encephalopathy) were withdrawn from the study because of AEs that were considered by the investigator to be not related to investigational product. Deaths Month Regimen Two (2; 1.1%) subjects in the 100-g C difficile group died during the study. One subject was diagnosed with malignant lung neoplasm on an unknown date after Dose 3. One subject experienced myocardial infarction at Day 373 after Dose 3. The events of malignant lung cancer and myocardial infarction were considered by the investigator to be not related to the investigational product. Day Regimen Two (2; 1.1%) subjects in the 100-g C difficile group and 1 subject in the 200-g C difficile group died during the study. One subject experienced cardiac arrest at Day 110 after Dose 3. One subject was diagnosed with brain neoplasm at Day 320 after Dose 3. One subject was diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma at Day 219 after Dose 3. The events of cardiac arrest, brain neoplasm, and pancreatic cancer were considered by the investigator to be not related to the investigational product. CONCLUSION(S): In conclusion, results from the original planned stage of the study demonstrated the following:  The 200-g dose level was more immunogenic as evidenced by numerically higher proportions of subjects  threshold, GMCs, and GMFRs than the 100-g dose level in both dosing regimens. 100-g and 200-g dose levels, particularly for toxin B in subjects who were seronegative at baseline.  The immune responses by age group (65 to 69 years, 70 to 74 years, and 75 to 79 years) were similar to that of the combined age group (65 to 85 years) as determined by proportions of subjects achieving both toxin A– and toxin B–specific neutralizing antibody levels  specified thresholds, GMCs, and GMFRs at Month 7 for the month regimen and Day 37 for the day regimen. The number of subjects 80 to 85 years of age was small and the interpretation of results for this age group should be conducted with caution.  Local reactions increased after Dose 2 for both regimens, but it was to a greater extent when it was administered at Day 8 in the day regimen, particularly at the 200-g dose level.  Rates of systemic events were similar between placebo and the 2 vaccine dose levels.  Overall, the AE profile observed in this study identified no untoward safety signals.
