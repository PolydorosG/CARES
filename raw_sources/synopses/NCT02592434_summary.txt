Study Objectives and Endpoints a. Endpoints from statistical analysis plan. METHODS Study Design: This was a randomized withdrawal, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 5 mg tofacitinib twice a day (BID) immediate release (IR) tablets or weight-equivalent dose of an oral solution in subjects from 2 to <18 years of age with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). All eligible subjects enrolled in the study initially received open-label tofacitinib for 18 weeks (run-in phase). At the end of the 18-week run-in phase, only subjects who achieved at least a JIA American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 30 response were randomized to the 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase. Subjects who did not achieve a JIA ACR 30 response at this time point were discontinued from the study. Subjects who experienced a single episode of disease flare (according to Pediatric Rheumatology Clinical Study Group/Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization [PRCSG/PRINTO] Disease Flare criteria) at any time during the study (including the open-label run-in and double-blind phase) were also discontinued from the study. Subjects who were eligible for the 26-week double-blind phase were randomized (1:1 ratio) to either active tofacitinib or placebo. For subjects with polyarticular course JIA (pJIA) (ie, E Oligo, polyarthritis rheumatoid factor positive (RF+), polyarthritis rheumatoid factor negative (RF-), and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) with active arthritis but without active systemic features), randomization was stratified by JIA category and baseline c-reactive protein (CRP) (normal, above normal). Randomization for subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) was stratified by JIA category. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Pediatric subjects with JIA were enrolled in this study. Study Treatment: Tofacitinib was provided as oral tablets (tofacitinib citrate 5 mg) and as an oral solution (CP-690,550-10 [tofacitinib citrate] 1 mg/mL) by the Sponsor. Open-label bottles of tofacitinib tablets and tofacitinib citrate oral solution were provided for the run-in phase of the study. Blinded-label bottles of tofacitinib tablets, tofacitinib citrate oral solution, and matching placebo, for oral administration, were provided for the double-blind phase of the study. All drug supplies (Table S2) for this study were required to be stored in accordance with the drug-labeled storage conditions. Table S2.

Efficacy Evaluations: Efficacy was assessed by:  Number of joints with active arthritis using the JIA ACR definition of any joint with swelling, or in the absence of swelling, limitation of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness not due to deformity  Physician’s Global Assessment of Overall Disease Activity  Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ)  Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ)  Inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and CRP)  JIA ACR core set variables  PRCSG/PRINTO Disease Flare criteria  JIA ACR 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100 response (improvement score) improvement from open label baseline of at least 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100% in at least 3 of the response variables 1 to 6 and no intermittent or spiking fever if the subject had sJIA  JIA ACR clinical inactive disease and clinical remission  Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS) (JADAS-27 CRP, JADAS 27 ESR) score  JADAS-27 minimal disease activity and inactive disease  In subjects with ERA, tender entheseal assessment, modified Schober’s test, and overall back pain and nocturnal back pain assessment were performed  In subjects with PsA, affected body surface area (BSA) and Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) of psoriasis were measured. Pharmacokinetic: Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of tofacitinib were collected from all subjects enrolled in the study at various time points. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included physical examinations, vital signs, adverse events (AEs), and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: The primary hypothesis was that among subjects who achieved ACR30 response at Week 18, those who remained on tofacitinib would have a lower rate of disease flare up to Week 44/end of study compared to those on placebo. Tofacitinib was considered superior to placebo with respect to occurrence of disease flare at Week 44/end of study (Week 26 of the double-blind phase) for polyarticular course JIA subjects if the test for difference in the occurrence rate resulted in a p-value (2-sided) <0.05. All efficacy endpoints were summarized descriptively. Binary variables were presented by number and percent. Continuous variables were presented by number, mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, minimum, and maximum. Time-to-event endpoints were presented by estimates of median event-free time and Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 286 subjects enrolled in the study (signed informed consent); 185 subjects completed the open-label run-in phase, with 173 subjects being randomized into the double-blind phase (88 subjects to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 85 subjects to placebo) (Figure S1). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of subjects entering the open-label run- in phase was 11.9 (4.06) years, and the mean (SD) age when first diagnosed was 8.1 (4.66) years. There were more female (N=169) than male (N=56) subjects in the study, and most subjects in the open-label run-in phase were White (196 [87.1%]). Figure S1.

Percentage based on the number of participants Efficacy Results: Primary Endpoint Result Occurrence of Disease Flare at Week 44 (Type I Error Controlled) The occurrence of disease flare was significantly lower in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group (p-value=0.0031), with a difference of proportions (tofacitinib-placebo) of -23.69%, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-39.41%, -7.97%). Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) sensitivity analysis results supported the primary endpoint result with a difference of proportions (tofacitinib-placebo) of -24.73%, 95% CI (-39.77%, -9.69%) (p-value=0.0013). The primary endpoint result was also supported when a general linear model approach was used (p-value=0.0007). Key Secondary Endpoint Results (Type I Error Controlled) JIA ACR 50, 30, and 70 Responses at Week 44 At Week 44, a significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID achieved JIA ACR 50, 30, and 70 responses compared to subjects treated with placebo (p=0.0166, p=0.0031, and p=0.0387, respectively). In all the subgroups, a numerically greater response was seen in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group, with the exception of ACR 70 response in geographic regions of Europe and South and Central America. Change from Double-Blind Baseline in CHAQ Disability Index at Week 44 The difference between the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline to Week 44 in CHAQ disability index for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and the LS mean change in CHAQ disability index for placebo over the same period was -0.12, indicating a statistically significant treatment effect favoring tofacitinib (p=0.0292). In all the subgroups, the difference in the LSmean changes from baseline (tofacitinib-placebo) had a negative value, thus favoring tofacitinib. Secondary Endpoints Results Occurrence of Disease Flare Open-Label Run-In Phase: There were 13 (8.44%) subjects that experienced disease flare at Week 18. Double-Blind Phase: A significantly smaller proportion of subjects treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID experienced disease flare compared to those treated with placebo beginning at Week 24 (p=0.0052) and the difference remained significant at each subsequent time point through Week 44 (p=0.0031). Time to Disease Flare According to PRCSG/PRINTO Disease Flare Criteria Open-Label Run-In Phase: There were 24 (13.0%) subjects that experienced disease flare in the open-label run-in phase at any time. There were 15 (8.2%) subjects who discontinued study treatment for reasons other than flare and were treated as flares. There were 145 (78.8%) subjects who remained flare free after the end of the open-label run-in phase. Double-Blind Phase: Fewer subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group (15 [20.8%] subjects) experienced disease flare in the double-blind phase compared to those in the placebo group (33 [47.1%] subjects). The hazard ratio of tofacitinib over placebo from the Cox-proportional hazards model was 0.459 (95% CI 0.268, 0.785), indicating a significant reduction in the risk of disease flare in the tofacitinib group relative to the placebo group (p=0.0037). The Kaplan-Meier median time to event estimate was 155 days for the placebo group and could not be estimated for the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group because there were too few flare events and the probability of flare free was 70.8% (>50%) in this group. JIA ACR 50, 30, 70, 90, and 100 Responses At Week 18 of the open-label run-in phase, 129 (83.77%) subjects had JIA ACR 50 response. During the double-blind phase, a significant difference in the number of subjects achieving JIA ACR 50 response was first observed between subjects continuing tofacitinib 5 mg BID and subjects randomized to placebo at Week 24 (p=0.0034). Significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 50 response compared to the placebo group at each subsequent time point through Week 44 (p=0.0166). At Week 18 of the open-label run-in phase, 142 (92.21%) subjects had JIA ACR 30 response. A significant difference in the number of subjects achieving JIA ACR 30 response was first observed in the double-blind phase between subjects continuing tofacitinib 5 mg BID and subjects randomized to placebo at Week 24 (p=0.0108). Compared to the placebo group, significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 30 response at each subsequent time point through Week 44 (p=0.0031). At Week 18 of the open-label run-in phase, 94 (61.04%) subjects had JIA ACR 70 response. A significant difference in the number of subjects achieving JIA ACR 70 response was first observed in the double-blind phase between subjects continuing tofacitinib 5 mg BID and subjects randomized to placebo at Week 32 (p=0.0258). Significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 70 response compared to the placebo group at Weeks 36, 40, and 44 (p=0.0149, p=0.0149, and p=0.0387, respectively). During the double-blind phase, significantly more subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 90 response compared to the placebo group at Week 32 (p=0.0356) and Week 36 (p=0.0115). At randomization (Week 18) there was a significantly higher proportion of subjects achieving a JIA ACR 100 response assigned to placebo compared to tofacitinib 5 mg BID. At each subsequent time point in the double-blind phase, a numerically higher proportion of subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved a JIA ACR 100 response compared to the placebo. Change from Baseline In JADAS-27 CRP, JADAS-27 ESR, and Achieving JADAS Minimum Disease Activity, and Inactive Disease During the open-label run-in phase, mean change from baseline in JADAS-27 CRP score decreased from baseline to Week 18 (from -6.35 at Week 2 to -15.80 at Week 18). A similar trend was observed for mean change from baseline in JADAS-27 ESR score (mean changes, -6.38 at Week 2 to -15.94 at Week 18). In the open-label run-in phase, the proportion of subjects with JADAS minimum disease activity calculated from the JADAS-27 CRP score increased from baseline at Week 2 and continued through Week 18 (4 [2.19%] to 68 [44.16%] subjects). A similar trend was observed for JADAS minimum disease activity calculated from the JADAS-27 ESR score (7 [3.83%] at Week 2 to 72 [46.75%] subjects at Week 18). In the open-label run-in phase, inactive disease calculated from the JADAS-27 CRP score was first achieved at Week 8 by 5 (2.84%) of the subjects and the proportion of subjects with inactive disease increased to 12 (7.79%) subjects at Week 18. JADAS inactive disease activity calculated from the JADAS-27 ESR score was observed in 2 (1.09%) subjects at Week 2 and increased to 36 (23.38%) subjects at Week 18. Double-Blind Phase: During the double-blind phase, the LS mean change from the double-blind baseline in JADAS-27 CRP score was significantly lower from Week 20 (p-value=0.0088) through Week 44 (p- value=0.0027) in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group. The LS mean change from baseline in JADAS-27 ESR score was also significantly lower in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group from Week 24 (p=0.0057) to Week 44 (p=0.0018). In the double-blind phase, the proportion of subjects with JADAS minimum disease activity calculated from the JADAS-27 CRP score was numerically higher from Week 18 through Week 44 in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group. A numerically larger proportion of subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group achieved JADAS minimum disease activity calculated from the JADAS 27 ESR score compared to the placebo group at all time points from Week 18 through Week 44. Statistical significance between the 2 groups was achieved at Week 44 (p=0.0228). In the double-blind phase, the proportion of subjects with JADAS inactive disease activity calculated from the JADAS-27 CRP score was statistically higher at Week 40 (p=0.0464) and numerically higher at Weeks 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and Week 44 in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group. A similar numerical trend was observed for JADAS inactive disease activity calculated from the JADAS-27 ESR score in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group. JIA ACR Inactive Disease at Each Scheduled Visit and Clinical Remission at Week 44 Open-Label Run-In Phase: During the open-label run-in phase, there were 2 (1.09%) subjects with JIA ACR inactive disease at Week 4, which increased to 26 (16.88%) subjects at Week 18. Double-Blind Phase: In general, the proportion of subjects with JIA ACR inactive disease increased from Week 18 to Week 44 in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and decreased in the placebo group during the double-blind phase. There were 3 (4.17%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 3 (4.29%) subjects in the placebo group with JIA ACR clinical remission (24 weeks of inactive disease, which may have begun during the open-label phase) by Week 44 in the double-blind phase. Change from Baseline in Each JIA ACR Core Set Variable at Each Scheduled Visit Up to Week 44 Open-Label Run-In Phase: The mean change from baseline in the number of joints with active arthritis and the number of joints with limited range of motion decreased throughout the open-label run-in phase. The mean (standard error [SE]) change from baseline activity at Week 2 and Week 18 was - 1.81 (0.11) and -4.54 (0.15), respectively, for physician global evaluation of disease; -0.94 (0.14) and -2.68 (0.19), respectively, for CHAQ Parental Evaluation of Overall Well-being; and -0.15 (0.03) and -0.49 (0.05), respectively, for CHAQ - Disability Index. Double-Blind Phase: The mean change from the double-baseline in the number of joints with active arthritis and the number of joints with limited range of motion decreased in the double-blind phase. During the double-blind phase, subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group had a significantly greater decrease in the number of active joints from the double-blind baseline compared to subjects in the placebo group at Week 36 (p-value=0.0041), Week 40 (p-value=0.0085), and Subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group also had a significantly lower mean change from the double-blind baseline in the number of joints with limited range of motion compared to subjects in the placebo group at Week 36 (p-value=0.0251) and Week 40 (p-value=0.0331). The mean change from the double-blind baseline in physician global evaluation of disease activity was significantly lower in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group at each time point in the double-blind phase, indicating that JIA disease activity was lower in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group than the placebo group. The mean change from the double-blind baseline in CHAQ Parental Evaluation of Overall Well-being was significantly lower in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group at all weeks in the double-blind phase except for Week 36 and Week 40. The mean change from the double-blind baseline in CHAQ Disability Index was numerically lower in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group at all time points in the double-blind phase and significantly lower at Week 28 (p-value=0.0324) and at Week 44 (p-value=0.0292). Change from Baseline in CHQ Responses Open-Label Run-In Phase: The mean (SD) change from baseline in Physical Summary Score was 8.12 (11.18) at Week 4 and increased to 13.36 (12.57) at Week 18. For Psychosocial Summary Score, the mean (SD) change from baseline was 2.46 (8.13) at Week 4 and increased to 4.20 (8.41) at Week 18. Double-Blind Phase: The LS mean change from the double-blind baseline was significantly lower for the Family Activities Subscale Standardized Score in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group (LS mean [SE] difference of -8.60 [3.23], 95% CI [- 15.03, -2.17], p-value=0.0095). At Week 44, the tofacitinib difference in the LS mean (SE) change from the double-blind baseline from placebo (tofacitinib-placebo) was 3.48 (2.03) for the Physical Summary Score and -0.75 (1.67) for the Psychosocial Summary Score (p-values=0.0902 and 0.6539, respectively). Change from Baseline in CHAQ Responses at Each Scheduled Visit Up to Week 44 Open-Label Run-In Phase: The mean (SE) change from baseline in CHAQ Discomfort Index in the open-label run-in phase decreased from -1.32 (0.16) at Week 2 to -3.04 (0.21) at Week 18, indicating a reduction of JIA disability throughout the open-label run-in phase. Double-Blind Phase: The mean change from the double-blind baseline in CHAQ Discomfort Index in the double-blind phase was significantly lower in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group compared to the placebo group at all weeks in the double-blind phase with the exception of Week 20 and Week 36, signifying a reduction in JIA disability for subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group during the double-blind phase compared to subjects in the placebo group. Subjects with ERA: Change from Baseline in The Tender Entheseal Assessment, Modified Schober’s Test, Overall Back Pain, and Nocturnal Back Pain Responses in the Open-Label Run-In and Double-Blind Phase Open-Label Run-In Phase: Tender entheseal assessments improved from Week 2 to Week 18. Modified Schober’s test scores improved from Week 2 to Week 18, indicating an improvement in the ability of subjects to flex their lower back. The mean change from baseline in both back pain at night and average back pain decreased from baseline over the course of the open-label run-in phase. Double-Blind Phase: Subjects in both groups demonstrated similar changes from the double-blind baseline in tender entheseal assessments, although no conclusions can be drawn because of the small sample size. Subjects in both groups demonstrated similar changes from the double-blind baseline in the modified Schober’s test, although no conclusions can be drawn because of small sample size. There was a numerical trend for subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group to have less back pain at night compared to subjects in the placebo group, although no conclusions can be drawn because of the small sample size. The mean change from baseline in average back pain was similar between treatment groups. Subjects with PSA: Change from Baseline in the BSA Affected with Psoriasis and PGA of Psoriasis Assessments in the Open-Label Run-In and Double-Blind Phase Open-Label Run-In Phase: The mean (SE) change from baseline in BSA affected with psoriasis at Week 18 of the open-label run-in phase was -0.46 (1.62). The mean (SE) change from baseline in the PGA of psoriasis assessments at Week 18 was -0.56 (0.26). Double-Blind Phase: Subjects treated with tofacitinib 5 mg BID showed a numerically greater decrease in the percentage of BSA affected with psoriasis compared to subjects treated with placebo, although no conclusions can be drawn because of the small sample size. Mean change (±SE) from double-blind baseline in the PGA of psoriasis assessments for subjects in the double-blind phase was similar between treatment groups, although no conclusions can be drawn because of the small sample size. Taste Acceptability of Tofacitinib Oral Solution, If Applicable, On Day 14 of the Open- Label Run-In Phase Open-Label Run-In Phase: Most subjects either liked the taste “very much” (34 [40.00%] subjects) or “a little” (32 [37.65%] subjects). There were few subjects who disliked the taste “a little” (8 [9.41%] subjects) or “very much” (4 [4.71%] subjects). Pharmacokinetic Results: The sparse PK sampling design precluded noncompartmental analysis (NCA) for each individual. Instead, the results will be pooled with other clinical studies to enable population PK analysis and be reported separately. Safety Results: Open-Label Run-In Phase: Overall, there were 411 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) experienced by 153 (68.0%) subjects during the open-label run-in phase. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for 7 (3.1%) subjects during the open label run-in phase. The most frequently reported TEAEs with ≥2% occurrence in the open-label run-in phase were Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (24 [10.7%] subjects), Headache (16 [7.1%] subjects), Nausea (13 [5.8%] subjects), and Vomiting (13 [5.8%] subjects). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 64 (28.4%) subjects during the open-label run-in phase. Most treatment-related TEAEs reported were mild to moderate in severity. Overall, 26 (11.6%) subjects discontinued from the study because of an AE during the open label run-in phase. There were 16 (7.1%) subjects that discontinued from the study during the open-label run-in phase because of condition-aggravated AEs (ie, worsening disease). During the open-label run-in phase, a total of 10 SAEs were reported by 7 subjects. Double-Blind Phase: Overall, there were 160 TEAEs experienced by 68 (77.3%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 166 TEAEs experienced by 63 (74.1%) subjects in the placebo group during the double‑blind phase. SAEs were reported for 1 (1.1%) and 2 (2.4%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and placebo groups, respectively, during the double-blind phase. There were 16 (18.2%) and 29 (34.1%) subjects discontinued from the study because of an AE in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and placebo groups, respectively. The most frequently reported PTs in the double-blind phase were:  Tofacitinib 5 mg BID: Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (13 [14.8%] subjects), Disease Progression (8 [9.1%] subjects), and Nasopharyngitis (7 [8.0%] subjects).  Placebo group: Disease Progression (13 [15.3%] subjects), Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (12 [14.1%] subjects), and Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (9 [10.6%] subjects). Treatment‑related TEAEs were seen in 22 (25.0%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 33 (38.8%) subjects in the placebo group during the double‑blind phase. Most treatment-related TEAEs reported were mild to moderate in severity. During the double-blind phase, there were 16 (18.2%) subjects in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and 29 (34.1%) subjects in the placebo group that discontinued the study because of an AE. Fewer subjects in the tofacitinib group discontinued from the study during the double-blind phase because of condition-aggravated (ie, worsening disease) AEs than in the placebo group (14 [15.9%] vs 27 [31.8%] subjects, respectively). In the double-blind phase, 1 SAE was reported by 1 subject in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID group and a total of 3 SAEs were reported by 2 subjects in the placebo group. No deaths occurred during the study. Conclusion(s): Tofacitinib 5 mg BID treatment in subjects 2 to <18 years of age with JIA resulted in significant improvements in the occurrence of disease flare at Week 44 compared to subjects treated with placebo. Secondary efficacy results supported the primary conclusion. No new safety signals or issues were detected that were either unique to the JIA population treated with tofacitinib or new to the tofacitinib safety profile.
