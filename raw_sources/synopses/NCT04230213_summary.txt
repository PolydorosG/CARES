Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints Table S1. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This study was an open-label, 2-arm, randomized, parallel-group study conducted to assess the impact of multiple switches between Humira and PF-06410293 on steady-state adalimumab PK compared to the steady-state PK of adalimumab following continuous dosing with Humira. Safety and immunogenicity were evaluated between the 2 study treatment arms. In this document the treatment arm that included switches between PF-06410293 and Humira is referred to as the switching arm, while the treatment arm that included continuous Humira treatment is referred to as the non-switching arm. The study had a total of 4 treatment periods (TPs) and comprised 3 switches in the switching arm (Humira during TP1 and TP3, PF-06410293 during TP2 and TP4). The TP4 was followed by the Safety Follow-Up period (Figure S1):  TP1 (Lead In Period) began with the first dose of study intervention Humira on Week 0 (Day 1) and concluded with the completion of Week 10 pre-dose assessments.  TP2 began at Week 10 with the 1:1 randomization of the participants to either the switching arm or the non-switching arm and concluded with the completion of Week 16 pre-dose assessments.  TP3 began with study intervention dosing on Week 16, and concluded with the completion of Week 22 pre-dose assessments.  TP4 began with study intervention dosing on Week 22 and concluded with EoT assessments and final dose administration at Week 32. Onsite study intervention dosing was scheduled at Weeks 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30, followed by the 2-week PK sampling period.  PK sampling period of 2 weeks started with Week 30 pre-dose PK collection and concluded with Week 32 pre-dose PK collection. Safety Follow Up Period began after the last dose of investigational product on Week 32, and concluded at completion of the Week 36 assessments. Week 36 safety follow up could be conducted via phone. All participants (including early discontinuations) were followed for at least 28 calendar days from the date of their last study treatment dose. The study was designed to establish interchangeability of PF-06410293 with Humira. The study design is consistent with recommendations outlined in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interchangeability guidance (2019) and FDA clinical pharmacology biosimilarity guidance (2016). The 40 mg dose is the recommended dose in the HUMIRA and PF-06410293 labels for participants with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Dose modification was not allowed in this trial to avoid potential confounding factors that could impact PK, as well as safety. Participants were required to continue their methotrexate (MTX) background therapy throughout the study. Figure S1. Study Schematic Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: 1.

Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Primary endpoint data were supported by adalimumab serum drug concentrations for the 2-week PK Profile (Week 30 pre-dose to Week 32 pre- dose). Blood samples were collected for measurement of each time point when serum concentrations of adalimumab were planned. Collection to determine adalimumab trough concentrations:  Day 1 (time 0), Weeks 10 and 16: Maximum of 48 hours prior but as close as possible prior to the study intervention administration (ie, pre-dose).  Weeks 22, 24, 26, 28: within 6 hours prior to the study intervention administration. Collection to determine PK Profile:  Pre-dose PK collection at Week 30/PK Profile Day 1, within 6 hours prior to study intervention administration.  For the subsequent PK Profile Days, post-Week 30 dosing times for sample collections were:  48 (+4) hrs on PK Profile Day 3  72 (+6) hrs on PK Profile Day 4  96 (+8) hrs on PK Profile Day 5  144 (+8) hrs on PK Profile Day 7  240 (+24) hrs on PK Profile Day 11  336 (+24) hrs on PK Profile Day 15; before Week 32 dosing Pharmacodynamic Evaluations: Pharmacodynamic parameters were not evaluated in this study. Pharmacogenomic Evaluations: Pharmacogenomic parameters were not evaluated in this study. Anti-Adalimumab Antibody and Neutralizing Anti-Adalimumab Antibodies: Blood samples were collected concurrently with samples for PK analysis in TP1 through TP4 to determine the presence of ADA and NAb. Safety Evaluations: Safety was assessed by the reporting of AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the investigational product. The safety endpoints included assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs classified as Grade 3 or higher, and assessment of significant clinical abnormalities and change from baseline in selected clinical laboratory values and vital signs. Safety endpoints were evaluated by type, occurrence, severity, timing, seriousness and relatedness of treatment-emergent AEs and laboratory test abnormalities. Statistical Methods: Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Parameters Serum concentrations of the drug between Week 30 and Week 32 were analyzed for the PK population using standard non-compartmental analysis to estimate the PK parameters (C , max area under the serum concentration-time curve over the dosing interval [AUC ], time of tau maximum observed serum concentration [T ], C , and CL/F) for each individual max av participant. C was estimated for TP1 through TP4 (Safety-Randomized population). trough Primary Endpoints: C and AUC max tau The primary analysis for C , and AUC was analysis of variance (ANOVA) with terms for max tau treatment and randomization stratification factor (body weight categories) to compare switching arm and non-switching arm in log-transformed data in PK population. The mean difference and the confidence interval (CI) for the differences were obtained using ANOVA model. The mean differences and the CI were exponentiated to provide estimates of geometric mean ratios (GMR) and the 90% CIs for the ratio. Interchangeability was established statistically if the 90% CI for the GMR was within 80.00% to 125.00% for both endpoints. C and AUC were summarized descriptively for switching arm and non-switching arm. max tau The primary endpoints were summarized by ADA and NAb status at Week 30. Secondary PK parameters: Secondary PK parameters, T , C and CL/F, and serum concentrations collected between max av Week 30 and Week 32 were summarized descriptively for switching arm and non-switching arm. C was summarized descriptively by each visit and box plots were provided. trough Summarization for secondary PK parameters and serum concentrations collected between Week 30 and Week 32 were provided by ADA and NAb status at Week 30. Plots for serum concentrations during Week 30 to Week 32 were provided by ADA and NAb status at Week 30. C at each visit was summarized and plotted by ADA and NAb status at the trough corresponding visit. ADA and NAb Analyses: For the ADA and NAb data, the percentage of participants in the Safety-randomized population with positive ADA and NAb were calculated and summarized by each visit from TP1 through TP4. The magnitude (titer) and the time of first positive sample were described. Positive ADA and positive NAb of the last available sample for each participant were used to characterize the participant’s ADA and NAb response as persistent. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Participant dispositions were balanced between the two treatment groups during the study from randomization to last visit. A majority of the randomized participants completed the study in both treatment groups. Summary of participant disposition is described below and in Table S3. Table S3. Summary of Subject Disposition in Study B5381012 Abbreviations: ITT = intent to treat Baseline demographic characteristics in the Enrolled-TP1 population: The majority of participants were white (98.9% [440 out of 445]), female (82.7%), and not Hispanic or Latino (98.9%). Median age of participants was 56.0 years. The majority of participants were 45-64 years of age (60.9%). Median weight was 72.1 kg. Baseline demographic characteristics in During TP2 and Beyond: Baseline demographic characteristics in the ITT-randomized population were balanced across the two treatment arms. The majority of participants in any treatment arm were white (99.5% and 98.1% in the switching and non-switching arms, respectively), female (82.2% and 83.6% in the switching and non-switching arms, respectively), and not Hispanic or Latino (98.6% and 99.5% in the switching and non-switching arms, respectively). Median age of participants was 56.0 years and 56.0 years in the switching and non-switching arms, respectively. The majority of participants in any treatment arm were 45-64 years of age. Median weight was 72.6 kg and 72.5 kg in the switching and non-switching arms, respectively. Demographic and baseline characteristics in the PK population were balanced across treatment groups. In both arms a majority of participants were white (99.5% in switching arm and 98.4% in non-switching arm) and female (80.9% in switching and 84.4% in non- switching arms), and not Hispanic or Latino (99.0% in switching and 99.5% in non-switching arms. Median age of participants was 56.0 years in switching arm and 56.0 years in non- switching arms. In both arms, a majority of participants (61.3% in switching arm and 57.0% in non-switching arm) were 45-64 years of age. Median body weight was 72.9 kg in switching arm and 71.5 kg in non-switching arm. Pharmacokinetic Results: Using PK as a surrogate for efficacy, the primary endpoint results (ie, C and AUC ) max tau support that the risk in terms of diminished efficacy of switching between treatment with Humira and PF-06410293 is not greater than the risk of using Humira without the switch. PK equivalence between switching arm and non-switching arm was established statistically. The 90% CIs for the GMRs of C and AUC were within the equivalence margin of max tau 80.00% to 125.00% (Table S4). This is further corroborated by results for the secondary endpoints. Descriptive statistical summaries for T , C and CL/F show that these PK parameters were max av similar in the switching and non-switching arms (Table S5). The mean/median values were similar in switching and non-switching arms for all 3 PK parameters. The ranges in switching and non-switching arms for all 3 PK parameters largely overlapped. The variability in Cav and CL/F was similar in both switching and non-switching arms. A similar mean PK profile was exhibited in both switching and non-switching arms (Figure S2).  Figure S2. Mean PK Concentrations - Time Plot (Linear Scale) (Week 30-32), Treatment Period 4 - PK Population Summary statistics have been calculated by setting concentration values below the lower limit of quantification to zero. The lower limit of quantification is 0.25 ug/ml. Adalimumab C was similar in switching and non-switching arms at each of the study trough across the visits within each treatment arm, which suggests that the participants had reached steady-state at Week 30.

Anti-Drug Antibody and Neutralizing Anti-drug Antibody Results: The percentage of participants reporting as ADA positive was balanced at Week 10 (day of randomization) and remained balanced between switching and non-switching groups throughout the study duration (TP2 and beyond). ADA and NAb titers by visit were also balanced for switching and non-switching groups for each study visit. Safety Results: The median doses administered to the 445 study participants in TP1 were 5, over a median duration of treatment of 57.0 days. Median study drug duration post randomization (TP2 and beyond) and the median total number of doses administered were balanced across both treatment arms. There were no deaths at any time during the study in any treatment period. In TP1, 107 out of 445 participants had 198 all-causality adverse events, of these 13 out of 445 (2.9 %) participants reported treatment-emergent serious AEs. participants in non-switching arm had 152 and 123 had all-causality AEs, respectively. In TP2 and beyond, 3 (1.4%) participants in switching arm and 8 (3.7%) participants in non-switching arm had serious TEAEs (Table S6). Conclusions: The results of this clinical study support that the risk of switching between treatment with Humira and PF-06410293 in terms of safety or diminished efficacy (using PK as surrogate) is not greater than the risk of using Humira without the switch. Pharmacokinetics  The primary analysis demonstrated that GMR 90% CIs for AUC and C were within tau max the prespecified (80.00% - 125.00%) margin, therefore PK equivalence was established between the switching treatment with Humira and PF-06410293 compared with treatment with Humira without the switch.  There were no clinically meaningful differences in exposures comparing the mean steady-state PK concentrations in the switching arm and the non-switching arm.  Number and percentage of ADA and NAb positive participants, and titers were balanced between the 2 treatment arms at every visit during the study.  The impact of ADA on the mean steady-state PK was similar in the switching and the non-switching arm. The lower PK concentrations (µg/mL) between Week 30 and Week 32 in ADA positive participants was similar across both treatment arms.  The impact of NAb on the mean steady-state PK was similar in the switching and the non-switching arms. The lower PK concentrations (µg/mL) between Week 30 and Week 32 in NAb positive samples at Week 30 was similar across both treatment arms. Immunogenicity  The review of events identified as potentially immunogenic reactions to the drug, including injection site reactions did not identify any clinically meaningful imbalance.  There was no medically evaluated case meeting Sampson criteria for anaphylaxis in any treatment arm.  Number and percent of participants with potentially immunogenic reactions to the drug by ADA status over time was small, with no clinically significant differences between the 2 treatment arms Safety Based on the assessment of SAEs and AESI, including immunogenic AEs to the drug, there were no clinically meaningful differences between the switching and non-switching arm.  Occurrence of Grade 3 or higher AESIs, including immunogenic AEs to the drug, was balanced between the two treatment arms.  Permanent discontinuations due to AEs were balanced between the two treatment arms.
