PROPRIETARY DRUG NAME®/GENERIC DRUG NAME: Prevnar 13®/Prevenar 13®/Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine (diphtheria CRM197 protein) PROTOCOL NO.: B4671001 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Phase 3, Randomized, Open-Label Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Formulated in Multidose Vials Given With Routine Pediatric Vaccinations in Healthy Infants Study Center: One (1) site in The Gambia Study Initiation Date and Final Completion Dates: 09 January 2014 to 01 September 2014. Final serology date: 18 November 2014 Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Primary Objective:  To demonstrate that the immune response induced by 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) with 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE) was noninferior to the immune response induced by 13vPnC without 2-PE as measured by serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations 1 month after the infant series. Primary Safety Objective:  To evaluate the safety profile of 13vPnC with 2-PE as measured by the incidence rates of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs). Secondary Objective:  To assess the immune response induced by 13vPnC with 2-PE relative to the immune response induced by 13vPnC without 2-PE as measured by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA). METHODS Study Design: This was a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study to compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13vPnC with 2-PE to that of 13vPnC without 2-PE when aged approximately 8 weeks at enrollment were to participate in this study at 1 site in The Gambia for approximately 4 months. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 vaccine groups and received one intramuscular injection of either 13vPnC with 2-PE or 13vPnC without 2-PE at approximately 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age (Visits 1, 2, and 3, respectively). One (1) blood sample (5 mL) was collected at approximately 20 weeks of age (at Visit 4, approximately 1 month after the third dose of 13vPnC [infant series]) (Table 1). Per local practice, routine pediatric vaccines required by local recommendations (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis/hepatitis B/Haemophilus influenzae type b [DTP/HepB/Hib] vaccine combination, oral poliovirus vaccine [OPV], rotavirus vaccine, and Bacille Calmette-Guérin [BCG] vaccine) were administered concomitantly with 13vPnC multidose vial (MDV) (with 2-PE) or 13vPnC single-dose syringe (SDS) (without 2-PE) but were given in a different limb (as applicable) at Visits 1, 2, and 3.

Abbreviations: 13vPnC = 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. a. Visit windows are included in this protocol so that subjects in this study all have their vaccinations and blood draws within a broadly uniform time frame. However, because of the population under study, it is recognized that it may not always be possible to adhere to these windows (for example due to subject illness). b. For events persisting at Day 6 and use of antipyretic medication continuing at Day 6, diary data will be collected daily until resolution. per group) were to be enrolled in the study based upon the sample size simulations for proportions of responders with IgG concentration 0.35 g/mL and for the ratios of the IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for the 13vPnC MDV group relative to the 13vPnC SDS group, and based on an estimated dropout rate of 20%. Hereinafter, the group of subjects who received 13vPnC with 2-PE in MDVs is referred to as the 13vPnC MDV group and the group of subjects who received 13vPnC without 2-PE in SDSs is referred to as the 13vPnC SDS group. The study was designed to compare the formulations (13vPnC with 2- PE vs 13vPnC without 2-PE), not the presentations (vial vs syringe). A total of 500 subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either 13vPnC MDV group or 13vPnC SDS group. Of the 500 subjects randomized, all subjects (250 in each vaccine group) received Dose 1, 497 subjects (249 in the 13vPnC MDV group and 248 in the 13vPnC SDS group) received Dose 2, and 491 subjects (247 in the 13vPnC MDV group and 244 in the 13vPnC SDS group) received Dose 3. Of the 500 subjects screened and randomized, 489 (97.8%) subjects completed the blood draw 1 month after Dose 3 and completed the study; the percentages of subjects were similar across groups. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects eligible for the study were healthy infants (determined by medical history, physical examination, and judgment of the investigator) aged 42 to 70 days and had a weight of 3.5 kg or greater at the time of enrollment. Subjects with previous vaccination with licensed or investigational pneumococcal vaccine, previous anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine or vaccine-related component, contraindication to vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and receipt of blood products or gamma-globulin since birth were excluded from the study. Study Vaccine: Subjects received 1 dose (0.5 mL) of either 13vPnC with 2-PE or 13vPnC without 2-PE according to their randomization assignment, at approximately 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age (Visits 1, 2, and 3, respectively) (Table 1). Each dose of study vaccine was administered intramuscularly into the anterolateral thigh muscle of the left leg. 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (presented in SDSs and MDVs): 13vPnC presented in SDSs contains saccharides from pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F individually conjugated to nontoxic diphtheria toxin (cross-reactive material 197; CRM ). The vaccine was formulated to contain 2.2 μg of each 197 saccharide, except for 4.4 μg of 6B, per 0.5-mL dose. The final formulation contains 5 mM succinate buffer, and 0.02% polysorbate 80 with 0.125 mg of aluminum as aluminum phosphate (AlPO ), per 0.5-mL dose. 4 13vPnC presented in MDVs contains all of the components listed above as well as 4 mg of 2-PE per 0.5-mL dose as a preservative. Four (4) doses of 13vPnC (2.0 mL) were contained within each MDV. For the purpose of the study, only one 0.5-mL dose was withdrawn and administered from each of the 13vPnC MDVs. Immunogenicity Endpoints: Primary Endpoint:  The percentage of subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG concentration 0.35 g/mL for each of the pneumococcal serotypes measured 1 month after the infant series for each vaccine group. Coprimary Endpoint:  The serotype-specific IgG GMC for each of the pneumococcal serotypes measured 1 month after the infant series for each vaccine group (13vPnC MDV group or 13vPnC SDS group). Secondary Endpoints:  The proportion of subjects in a subset achieving a serotype-specific OPA titer  lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for each of the pneumococcal serotypes measured 1 month after the infant series for each vaccine group.  The serotype-specific OPA geometric mean titer (GMT) for each of the pneumococcal serotypes 1 month after the infant series for each vaccine group. Primary Safety Endpoints:  The number of subjects reporting local reactions and systemic events (and antipyretic medication use) in the 5 days after each vaccination in the 13vPnC MDV group and 13vPnC SDS group.  The number of subjects reporting AEs in the 13vPnC MDV group and 13vPnC SDS group. One (1) blood sample (5 mL) was collected at approximately 20 weeks of age (at Visit 4, approximately 1 month after the third dose of 13vPnC [infant series]). These samples were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serotype-specific IgG concentrations to the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) for all subjects. OPA assays to the 13 pneumococcal serotypes were performed on these same blood samples in a subset of randomly selected subjects from each group to yield approximately 100 results per group for all serotypes and OPAs were measured using a serotype-specific microcolony OPA (mcOPA) assay. Antibody concentrations above the LLOQ were considered accurate and their quantitated values were reported. The limit of detection (LOD) was established as 50% of the LLOQ. Values below the LLOQ or denoted below the limit of quantification (BLQ) were set to 0.5×LOD for analysis. reported. OPA titers below the LLOQ or denoted as BLQ were set to 0.5×LLOQ for analysis. Safety Evaluations: The day of vaccination was considered to be Day 1 for purposes of safety evaluations. Acute reactions were assessed for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination and documented on the case report form (CRF) at Visits 1, 2, and 3. Beginning on Day 2 after each vaccination, reactogenicity events (local reactions and systemic events) were assessed and recorded in electronic diaries (e-diaries) by field workers who visited the subjects’ homes. Field worker assessment of reactogenicity events and e- diary recording continued through Day 6 after each vaccination. Local reactions included presence of redness, swelling, and tenderness at the injection site at the time of field worker assessment. Systemic events included fever (temperature 38.0°C), loss of appetite or decreased appetite, drowsiness (synonymous with increased sleep), and irritability (fussiness) (synonymous with restless sleep; decreased sleep). In addition, the use of antipyretic medication was recorded daily for 5 days after each vaccination (Days 2 to 6). For events persisting at Day 6 and use of antipyretic medication continuing at Day 6, the field worker continued to visit the subject daily and completed the e-diary until resolution. If a fever (temperature 38.0°C) was recorded from Day 2 onward, the subject was required to have a rapid test for malaria as per local practice. AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded on the AE CRF from the signing of the informed consent document (ICD) to Visit 4 (postvaccination blood draw). Withdrawal due to an AE was distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response and was recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page. SAEs experienced by a subject after the active reporting period had ended were reported to the sponsor if the investigator became aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believed had at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product were reported to the sponsor. Statistical Methods: For the immunogenicity analyses, 2 analysis populations were defined: evaluable and all-available immunogenicity populations. Evaluable Immunogenicity Population: included subjects who:  Were eligible for the study  Were 42 to 70 days of age, inclusive, on the day of first vaccination  Received the vaccine formulation to which they were randomly assigned at all infant doses (when vaccinated)  Had at least 1 valid and determinate pneumococcal assay result after the third vaccination of infant series (MDV and SDS) that would contribute to the planned analysis  Had the blood draw after the infant series within the required time frame (27 to 56 days after the third vaccination [MDV and SDS])  Received no prohibited vaccines  Had no other major protocol violations as determined by the clinical lead or clinicians All-available immunogenicity population: included subjects who had at least 1 valid and determinate pneumococcal assay result after the infant series for each vaccine group. Safety population set: included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product. Immunogenicity Analysis: For each of the pneumococcal serotypes for each vaccine group, the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG concentration 0.35 g/mL 1 month after the infant series and the coprimary endpoint was the serotype specific IgG GMC 1 month after the infant series. For primary endpoint, noninferiority for a serotype (MDV relative to SDS) was claimed if the lower limit of the 97.5% confidence interval (CI) of difference in proportions (MDV – SDS) was greater than -10%. For the coprimary endpoint (IgG GMC), noninferiority for a serotype (MDV relative to SDS) was claimed if the lower limit of the 97.5% CI of geometric mean ratio (GMR) (MDV relative to SDS) was greater than 0.5. If noninferiority for either the primary endpoint or the coprimary endpoint could be claimed for all the 13 serotypes, then the noninferiority of immunogenicity response of the MDV group to the SDS group for this study was declared. The proportion of subjects achieving IgG concentration or OPA titer at the prespecified level for each of the pneumococcal serotypes were computed at the proposed analysis endpoints for each vaccine group. In addition, exact, unconditional, 2-sided, 95% CIs on the proportion were computed using the F distribution. The differences in proportions for the 2 vaccine groups were calculated along with the 97.5% (or 95% CIs). The GMRs were calculated along with the 97.5% CIs (or 95% CIs) for IgG concentration and OPA titer. CIs for GMR (MDV – SDS) were constructed by back transformation of the CIs for the difference of the 2 logarithmically transformed assay results computed using the Student t distribution. Safety Analysis: For the safety analysis, subjects were analyzed according to vaccine received. For local descriptive statistics. The mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation were presented along with the number of unknown durations. Only subjects actually reporting a reaction or event were included in the summary statistics. Subjects with no reported reaction or event were included in the number of subjects with a known value. AEs, SAEs, related AEs, and related SAEs were summarized separately for the infant series by vaccine group and total sample and for each vaccination. AEs and SAEs that were reported prior to Dose 1 of the infant series were also summarized. In addition, tables for related events, events that caused study discontinuation, events of mild or moderate severity, and events characterized as severe or life threatening were tabulated by vaccine group for those events occurring during the study. AEs were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 17.1. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: The disposition of subjects at each time point is summarized for the 13vPnC MDV group and 13vPnC SDS group in Table 3. A total of 489 (97.8%) subjects completed the blood draw 1 month after Dose 3 and completed the study; the percentages of subjects were similar across both groups. Table 3.

Runtime ID: 09DEC2014 17:19 Date of Reporting Dataset Creation: 09DEC2014 Deaths: During the infant series, 1 subject (13vPnC MDV group) died due to sudden infant death syndrome 20 days after Dose 3 of the infant series. CONCLUSION(S): In conclusion, the immune response induced by 13vPnC with 2-PE was noninferior to the immune response induced by 13vPnC without 2-PE when given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age with routine pediatric vaccinations in healthy infants. generally consistent with conditions common in this age group. There was 1 SAE noted during the study, but it was assessed as not related to the study vaccine.
