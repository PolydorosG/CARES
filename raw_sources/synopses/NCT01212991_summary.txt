CRF’s For Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, And  Abbreviation Definition OLE open-label extension  Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) The final protocol and any amendments (previous overall survival [OS] supplemental clinical study report [CSR] dated 14 December 2018, Section 16.1.1) were reviewed and approved by the IRB(s) and/or IEC(s) at each of the investigational centers participating in the study. The IRB(s) and IEC(s) are listed in Section 16.1.3.1. Ethical Conduct of the Study This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines. In addition, all local regulatory requirements were followed, in particular, those affording greater protection to the safety of trial participants. INTRODUCTION MDV3100-03 (C3431003; PREVAIL) was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of oral enzalutamide (formerly MDV3100) (160 mg/day) when administered to chemotherapy-naïve patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer who had disease progression despite androgen deprivation therapy. The coprimary efficacy endpoints were to determine the benefit of enzalutamide as compared to placebo as assessed by OS and by radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). As reported in the primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014), the MDV3100-03 study demonstrated that treatment with enzalutamide decreased the risk of death by 29% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.706, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.596, 0.837; p <0.0001). The benefit in OS was observed early, with separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves as early as 3 to 4 months after randomization. A total of 241 enzalutamide-treated patients (27.6%) and 299 placebo-treated patients (35.4%) died as of the data cutoff date of 16 September 2013. The results of this interim analysis met the prespecified stopping criterion. Treatment with enzalutamide also conferred an important benefit on the coprimary endpoint, rPFS, as measured by blinded central review. Patients receiving enzalutamide had an 81% decreased risk of radiographic progression or death (HR = 0.186 [95% CI: 0.149, 0.231]; p <0.0001). The effect on rPFS was observed at the first postbaseline imaging time point as demonstrated by the early separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves, and increased over time. An addendum (dated 19 December 2014 with a data cutoff date of 01 June 2014) to the primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014) presented the OS analysis containing a minimum of 765 death events as prespecified in the statistical analysis plan for the event-driven final analysis of the coprimary endpoint. A total of 368 enzalutamide-treated patients (42.2%) and 416 placebo-treated patients (49.2%) died as of the data cutoff date of 01 June 2014. This analysis was conducted for completeness, as the interim analysis results met the stopping criterion. In addition, the use of subsequent therapies (initiated after disease progression) for presented. A second addendum (dated 13 April 2015 with a data cutoff date of 15 January 2014) to the primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014) presented the updated sensitivity analysis of the coprimary endpoint rPFS based on investigator assessment, defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause within 168 days after treatment discontinuation, whichever occurred first. Patients continued to be followed for survival, and a supplemental CSR (dated 14 December 2018 with a data cutoff date of 30 September 2017) presented an analysis of OS after all patients had been followed for a minimum of 5 years, died, or were otherwise lost to follow-up or had withdrawn consent. Safety information (ie, commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events [TEAEs], Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, study drug-related TEAEs, deaths, and serious TEAEs) was also provided in addition to a summary of subsequent antineoplastic therapy use for prostate cancer. As of the 5-year analysis data cutoff date of 30 September 2017, a statistically significant increase in OS was observed in patients treated with enzalutamide compared to placebo (median: 35.5 and 31.4 months, respectively; HR = 0.835, 95% CI: 0.751, 0.928; p-value = 0.0008). The 5-year OS rate was 26% for the enzalutamide arm compared to 21% for the placebo arm. These results were observed despite the fact that 28% of patients on placebo crossed over to enzalutamide. The significant treatment effect seen in previous analyses was maintained. This final supplemental CSR presents the results of the final assessment of safety. This supplemental CSR includes the cumulative safety results for all patients until the Last Patient Last Visit (LPLV) on 14 February 2019. The safety of enzalutamide was assessed by the frequency of adverse events (AEs), Grade 3 or higher AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), AEs that were the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug, AEs associated with discontinuation of study drug, AEs leading to dose modification, and deaths. STUDY OBJECTIVES Refer to the primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014) for a full list of primary and secondary study objectives. The primary objective for this final supplemental CSR is to present the cumulative results of the final assessment of safety. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN Study Design This randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide 160 mg administered by mouth once daily to men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer whose disease progressed despite androgen deprivation therapy. The coprimary endpoint of OS is the established standard for evaluating secondary and Study drug was continued as long as the patient tolerated the treatment until confirmed radiographic disease progression or a skeletal related event AND 1 of the 2 following events occurred: 1) initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy; or 2) initiation of an investigational agent for treatment of prostate cancer. Patients were to continue androgen deprivation therapy as applicable (ie, ongoing gonadotropin releasing hormone [GnRH] analogue therapy for patients without surgical castration) while on study treatment. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise without evidence of confirmed radiographic progression or a skeletal-related event was discouraged as a criterion to start a new systemic anti-neoplastic therapy throughout the study. If another non-cytotoxic anti-neoplastic agent was initiated, study drug therapy was continued per the Investigator’s clinical judgment as long as the patient was tolerating the study drug and continued androgen deprivation therapy. Radiation therapy, vaccine therapy, and initiation of bisphosphonates or other approved bone targeting agents, and standard of care steroid and pain management were allowed and did not result in discontinuation of study drug. As summarized in the primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014), the following assessments of prostate cancer status were collected during the course of the trial: OS, soft tissue disease on computed tomography (CT) scan or on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone disease on radionuclide bone scans, skeletal-related events, Brief Pain Inventory, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P), European Quality of Life 5-Domain Scale (EQ-5D) quality of life questionnaires, and PSA. The consensus guidelines of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) were taken into consideration for the determination of radiographic disease progression. Based on the results reported in the primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014), protocol amendment No. 5 (28 October 2013) was implemented to allow all ongoing enzalutamide-treated patients and previous placebo-treated patients who had not received commercial enzalutamide the opportunity to receive open-label access to enzalutamide. This supplemental CSR includes the cumulative safety results for all patients until the LPLV on 14 February 2019. Selection of Study Population Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Eligible patients received randomized double-blind treatment in PREVAIL; were willing to maintain androgen deprivation therapy with a GnRH agonist/antagonist or had a bilateral orchiectomy; had not taken commercially available enzalutamide (Xtandi); had not taken any other androgen receptor inhibitors, had not any clinically significant cardiovascular, dermatologic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematologic, hepatic, infections, metabolic, neurologic, psychological, pulmonary, or renal disorder or any other condition, including study participation in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor; and did not have current or previously treated brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease. Refer to the primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014) for a full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Treatments In the original study protocol, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive enzalutamide 160 mg or placebo, administered as four 40-mg capsules once per day by mouth (see primary CSR [dated 28 February 2014], Section 16.1.7). Patients self-administered blinded study drug once daily, with or without food. Following the results of the primary endpoints, all ongoing enzalutamide-treated patients and previous placebo-treated patients who had not received commercial enzalutamide were given the opportunity to receive open-label enzalutamide. Study drug lot numbers for enzalutamide received during the open-label extension (OLE) phase of this study are provided in Section 16.1.6. Safety Evaluations The safety of enzalutamide was assessed by the frequency of AEs, Grade 3 or higher AEs, SAEs, AEs that were the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug, AEs associated with discontinuation of study drug, AEs leading to dose modification, and deaths. Please refer to the Schedule of Activities in the protocol for details regarding safety assessment frequency. Statistical Methods Planned in the Protocol and Determination of Sample Size Refer to the primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014), Section 16.1.1. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Data Sets Analyzed Between 28 September 2010 and 07 September 2012, there were 1717 patients randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment with enzalutamide (872 patients) or placebo (845 patients); 1715 patients received at least 1 dose of enzalutamide (871 patients) or placebo (844 patients). As of the data cutoff date for the primary CSR (16 September 2013), 367 patients (42.1%) in the enzalutamide group and 61 patients (7.2%) in the placebo group remained on study drug. See primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014), Section 10.1 for further details on disposition as of the 16 September 2013 data cutoff date. The number of patients enrolled in OLE or long-term follow-up (LTFU) was 520 patients (59.6%) in the enzalutamide group and 435 patients (51.5%) in the placebo group. Two hundred thirty-one (231) patients (26.5%) in the enzalutamide and 234 patients (27.7%) in the placebo group received study drug in OLE; and 288 patients (33.0%) in the enzalutamide supplemental CSR (dated 14 December 2018) for further details. A summary of patients as of the LPLV date of 14 February 2019 is provided in Table 1. The primary reason for discontinuation of study drug in patients enrolled into the blinded and OLE phases of the study across all treatment groups was disease progression. As of the LPLV on 14 February 2019, the study was closed, and patients without disease progression were able to transition to a separate OLE study sponsored by Astellas. All patients are now off study. The primary reason for discontinuation of patients in the LTFU phase of the study across all treatment groups was death (enzalutamide group: 699 patients [80.2%]; placebo group: 550 patients [65.1%]; placebo patients crossover to enzalutamide group: 166 patients [70.9%]). Treatment discontinuation of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population is listed by patient in Section 16.2.1.1. Table 1. Patient Disposition by Study Treatment Phase (ITT Population) Table 1. Patient Disposition by Study Treatment Phase (ITT Population) Source: Table 14.1.3. The LPLV was 14 February 2019. Note: All percentages were based on total number of randomized patients in each treatment arm and for placebo patients that crossed over to enzalutamide. Treatment phase was defined as the period of time from the date of the first dose of study drug up to the last dose date. Long-term follow-up (LTFU) phase is the period from study drug discontinuation to the death date or last known survival date. Ongoing patients were defined as patients still in the respective phases. Off-study patients were defined as patients who discontinued the study in either phase. The majority of other reasons for treatment discontinuation were rising PSA. a Patients could have been summarized for more than 1 category but could have only been counted once for each category. b Clinical progression defined in the protocol (previous OS supplemental CSR [dated 14 December 2018], Section 16.1.1). c After 30 September 2017 those subjects still on open-label enzalutamide continued per protocol until they met withdrawal criteria or rolled into Astellas Master OLE (9735-CI-0123). For patients who rolled into Astellas Master OLE (9735-CI-0123), a final study visit was conducted and “sponsor decision” was entered on EOS CRF page. Demographic characteristics for the ITT population were summarized in the primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014), Section 11.2 and were maintained throughout the study. Patient demographics, concomitant medications, and patient enrollment information are listed in primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014) Listings 16.2.4.1, 16.2.4.2, and 16.2.4.3, respectively. Patient baseline characteristics are provided in primary CSR (dated 28 February 2014) Listings 16.2.4.4.1 and 16.2.4.4.2. Protocol Deviations Major protocol listings are provided in Section 16.2.2.2. Extent of Exposure The extent of exposure to study drug is summarized in Table 2. As of the LPLV date of 14 February 2019, a total of 871 patients in the enzalutamide group, 844 patients in the placebo group, and 234 placebo patients that crossed over to enzalutamide had received at least 1 dose or partial dose of study drug. The median treatment duration was 17.7 months for the enzalutamide group, 4.6 months for the placebo group, and 9.8 months on enzalutamide for patients who crossed over from placebo. Most patients in the enzalutamide group (591, 67.9%) received study drug for at least 12 months and most patients in the placebo group (526, 62.3%) received study drug for less than 6 months. Approximately 37% of enzalutamide-treated patients received study drug for at least 2 years. Approximately 20% of placebo patients who crossed over to enzalutamide received enzalutamide for at least 2 years. A by-patient listing of extent of exposure and compliance to study drug is provided in Section 16.2.5.3. Table 2. Extent of Exposure for Study Drug (Safety Population) Source: Table 14.1.9. The LPLV was 14 February 2019. a Treatment duration was calculated as (last dose date of study drug – first dose date of study drug + 1)/30.4375. b Total number of capsules taken was calculated as (number of capsules dispensed at all study visits – number of capsules indicated as having been returned). Capsules not returned were assumed to have been taken. c Placebo patients who received enzalutamide in the open-label extension period were included in the “Placebo Patients Crossover to Enzalutamide 160 mg” column. The overall summary of TEAEs as of the LPLV date of 14 February 2019 is presented in Table 3. Similar percentages of patients reported at least 1 TEAE in each group (enzalutamide: 98.4% [857 patients]; placebo: 93.7% [791 patients]; and placebo crossover to enzalutamide: 90.6% [212 patients]). The incidence of patients who reported TEAEs that were Grade 3 or higher were similar for the enzalutamide and placebo crossover to enzalutamide groups (53.4% and 55.1%, respectively), and 37.7% for the placebo group. The incidence of patients who reported serious TEAEs were similar for the enzalutamide and placebo crossover to enzalutamide groups (44.1% and 44.4%, respectively), and 27.1% for the placebo group. The safety results were consistent with those reported in the primary CSR (dated 19 December 2014); no new adverse drug reactions were identified. Table 3. Overall Summary of TEAEs - Safety Population Source: Table 14.3.1.1.1. The LPLV was 14 February 2019. MedDRA version: 16.1. a TEAE identified as primary reason for study drug discontinuation was from treatment discontinuation CRF. b TEAE with action taken of permanent discontinuation was from adverse event CRF. Commonly Reported TEAEs A summary of TEAEs that occurred in ≥10% of patients in any treatment group by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for the safety population is presented in Table 4, and a by-patient listing of all TEAEs is provided in Section 16.2.7.1. TEAEs are summarized by decreasing frequency of PT in Table 14.3.1.2.4. TEAEs are presented by SOC, PT, and maximum severity in Table 14.3.1.2.2. Population 102 118 18 Bone pain 18 (2.1%) 20 (2.4%) 3 (1.3%) (11.7%) (14.0%) (7.7%) Population Source: Table 14.3.1.2.1. The LPLV was 14 February 2019. Patients with multiple events for a given PT, SOC, or overall were counted only once per treatment column for each PT and overall, respectively. Events were sorted by SOC alphabetically and then by decreasing frequency of PT in the sum of treatment columns. MedDRA version: 16.1. The most frequently reported PTs were fatigue (38.3%, 26.1%, and 26.9% for the enzalutamide, placebo, and placebo crossover to enzalutamide groups, respectively); back pain (32.5%, 22.4%, and 13.7%, respectively); nausea (24.3%, 22.7%, and 15.4%, respectively); and constipation (25.5%, 17.4%, and 17.1%, respectively). TEAEs of interest were selected based on previously recognized important identified risks and/or feedback from health authorities recommending surveillance for specific events. Seven hundred twelve (712) patients (81.7%) in the enzalutamide group, 565 patients (66.9%) in the placebo group, and 154 placebo patients (65.8%) that crossed over to enzalutamide reported at least 1 TEAE of interest (Table 14.3.1.1.2). Most frequently for the enzalutamide, placebo, and placebo crossover to enzalutamide groups, respectively), fatigue (52.1%, 35.4%, and 34.6%, respectively), hypertension (17.8%, 4.9%, and 12.8%, respectively), fall (16.5%, 5.3%, and 6.8%, respectively), and fractures (16.0%, 5.3%, and 4.3%, respectively). TEAEs by SOC and PT by date of onset cut point (<1 year, 1 to <2 years, 2 to <3 years, 3 to <4 years, and ≥5 years) are presented in Tables 14.3.1.2.15.1, 14.3.1.2.15.2, and 14.3.1.2.15.3 for the enzalutamide, placebo, and placebo patients crossover to enzalutamide groups, respectively. The most frequently reported PTs at ≥5 years for the enzalutamide group were back pain (9.2%), fall (6.9%), haematuria (6.9%), and hypertension (5.7%). The most frequently reported PTs from 2 to <3 years for the placebo group were back pain (9.7%), oedema peripheral (6.5%), dizziness (6.5%), and dyspnoea (6.5%). In the placebo group, the frequency of reported dysnopea was consistent from <1 year to 2 to <3 years. The most frequently reported PTs from 4 to <5 years for the placebo crossover to enzalutamide group were anaemia, pyrexia, seasonal allergy, erysipelas, back pain, pain in extremity, and myelopathy (7.7% each). TEAEs and TEAEs of special interest were analyzed based on the time of the first report of the event to discriminate between early and late onset events. To put these results in perspective, it is relevant to note that the median treatment duration was longer for the enzalutamide group (17.7 months for the enzalutamide group, 4.6 months for the placebo group, and 9.8 months on enzalutamide for patients who crossed over from placebo). TEAEs of nonpathological fractures by SOC and PT by date of onset cut point (<1 year, 1 to <2 years, 2 to <3 years, 3 to <4 years, and ≥5 years) are presented in Tables 14.3.2.24.2.1, 14.3.2.24.2.2, and 14.3.2.24.2.3 for the enzalutamide, placebo, and placebo patients crossover to enzalutamide groups, respectively. The reported PTs at ≥5 years for the enzalutamide group were ankle fracture, hip fracture, lower limb fracture, rib fracture, and wrist fracture (1.1% each). No TEAEs of nonpathological fractures from 2 to <3 years were reported for the placebo group, and no TEAEs of nonpathological fractures from 4 to <5 years were reported for the placebo crossover to enzalutamide group. TEAEs of falls by SOC and PT by date of onset cut point (<1 year, 1 to <2 years, 2 to <3 years, 3 to <4 years, and ≥5 years) are presented in Tables 14.3.2.24.5.1, 14.3.2.24.5.2, and 14.3.2.24.5.3 for the enzalutamide, placebo, and placebo patients crossover to enzalutamide groups, respectively. The only reported PT at ≥5 years for the enzalutamide group was fall (6.9%). No TEAEs of falls from 2 to <3 years were reported for the placebo group, and no TEAEs of falls from 4 to <5 years were reported for the placebo crossover to enzalutamide group. TEAEs of cardiovascular events by SOC and PT by date of onset cut point (<1 year, 1 to <2 years, 2 to <3 years, 3 to <4 years, and ≥5 years) are presented in Tables 14.3.2.24.3.1, 14.3.2.24.3.2, and 14.3.2.24.3.3 for the enzalutamide, placebo, and placebo patients crossover to enzalutamide groups, respectively. The reported PTs at ≥5 years for the enzalutamide group were myocardial infarction (2.3%) and post procedural stroke (1.1%). crossover to enzalutamide group. TEAEs of fatigue by SOC and PT by date of onset cut point (<1 year, 1 to <2 years, 2 to <3 years, 3 to <4 years, and ≥5 years) are presented in Tables 14.3.2.24.4.1, 14.3.2.24.4.2, and 14.3.2.24.4.3 for the enzalutamide, placebo, and placebo patients crossover to enzalutamide groups, respectively.

Deaths A summary of deaths is provided in Table 5. As of the LPLV date of 14 February 2019, a total of 1415 deaths were reported (699 patients [80.2%] in enzalutamide group, 550 patients [65.1%] in placebo group, and 166 patients [70.9%] in placebo crossover to enzalutamide group). Fewer deaths were observed in the placebo group because deaths in the placebo group occurring after crossover to enzalutamide were included in the placebo crossover to enzalutamide column. The most frequent cause of death across treatment groups was disease progression (591 patients [67.8%] in enzalutamide group, 472 patients [55.9%] in placebo group, and 144 patients [61.5%] in placebo crossover to enzalutamide group). Other causes of death were comparable between treatment groups. Disease progression was the most frequent cause of death across treatment groups for all deaths within 30 days after the last dose date of study drug (23 patients [2.6%] in enzalutamide group, 14 patients [1.7%] in placebo group, and 22 patients [9.4%] in placebo Table 5.

Note: All deaths in the database at the cutoff date were included. MedDRA Version: 16.1. all TEAEs leading to death is provided in Section 16.2.7.8. As of the LPLV date of 14 February 2019, a total of 124 patients (60 patients [6.9%] in enzalutamide group, 32 patients [3.8%] in placebo group, and 32 patients [13.7%] in placebo crossover to enzalutamide group) reported at least 1 TEAE that resulted in death. Patients who crossed over from placebo in the double-blind phase to enzalutamide in the OLE phase may have had cancer progression and received alternative treatment in the interim period, and therefore may have been more ill or at risk for TEAEs. The SOCs with TEAEs resulting in death reported most frequently included general disorders and administration site conditions (3.2%, 1.5%, and 6.4% for the enzalutamide, placebo, and placebo crossover to enzalutamide groups, respectively), cardiac disorders (1.4%, 0.4%, and 1.7%, respectively), and neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) (0.7%, 0.5%, and 1.7%, respectively). Overall, the most common AE resulting in death was disease progression (10 enzalutamide patients [1.1%], 6 placebo patients [0.7%], and 11 placebo crossover to enzalutamide patients [4.7%]). Study drug-related TEAEs that resulted in death occurred in 2 patients (0.2%) in the enzalutamide group, 1 patient (0.1%) in the placebo group, and 1 patient (0.4%) in the placebo crossover to enzalutamide group (Section 16.2.7.8). One (1) patient (0.1%) reported cardiac failure and 1 patient (0.1%) reported cardiac failure congestive in the enzalutamide group, 1 patient (0.1%) reported tumour embolism and pulmonary haemorrhage in the placebo group, and 1 patient (0.4%) reported subdural haematoma in the placebo crossover to enzalutamide group. – Safety Population Prostate cancer 1 (0.1%) 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.4%) – Safety Population Source: Table 14.3.2.5.1.
