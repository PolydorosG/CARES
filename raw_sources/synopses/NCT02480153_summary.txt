The planned study completion date (Last Subject Last Visit) is 6 Dec 2017. Phase of Development: Phase 3/Comparative Efficacy and Safety Study Study Objectives: Primary Objective:  To compare the treatment efficacy between PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU in subjects with moderately to severely active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who were treated with adalimumab in combination with methotrexate. Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU.  To evaluate the immunogenicity of PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU.  To evaluate the multiple composite and individual parameters of clinical response to treatment transition from adalimumab-EU to PF-06410293.  To evaluate the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU.  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) response in response to PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU. This public disclosure synopsis (PDS) only presents study results of the primary endpoint and safety results for treatment period 1 (TP1), and will be updated to include results for all primary and secondary endpoints upon study completion. METHODS Study Design: This was a multi-national, 2-armed, randomized, double blind, parallel group study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, population PK, and immunogenicity of PF-06410293 versus adalimumab-EU in combination with methotrexate to treat subjects with moderately to severely active RA who had an inadequate response to methotrexate therapy. This study was also designed to evaluate clinical response, safety and immunogenicity after study drug transition (randomized blind single transition) from adalimumab-EU to PF-06410293 after 6 or 12 months of adalimumab-EU treatment. Upon completion of screening procedures and joint counts on Study Day 1, eligible subjects who met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized (1:1 ratio) into 1 of 2 study treatment arms to receive either PF-06410293 or adalimumab-EU. Study treatment was provided through 3 treatment periods.  Treatment Period 1 (TP1) began with the first dose of study drug at Week 0 (Day 1) and concluded with the completion of Week 26 pre-dose assessments. Subjects were blindly randomized into adalimumab-EU and PF-06410293 in a 1:1 ratio.  Treatment Period 2 (TP2) began with the study drug dosing for Week 26, and concluded with the completion of Week 52 pre-dose assessments. At the beginning of TP2, eligible subjects from the adalimumab-EU arm were blindly re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to remain on adalimumab-EU or transition to PF-06410293. Week 52 was the end of the blinded treatment periods in this study.  Treatment Period 3 (TP3) began with Week 52 study drug dosing, with last study drug dosing scheduled on Week 76 and the end of treatment (EOT) visit on Week 78. At the beginning of TP3, all the remaining subjects on adalimumab-EU were switched to PF-06410293 (open label).  Follow-Up Period: 16 weeks after last dose of study drug (up to Week 92). administration. Study visits for TP1 were scheduled at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 26. Unplanned visits may be scheduled by the investigator in order to conduct assessments required to protect the wellbeing of the subject. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and DAS28-4 (CRP) (Disease Activity Score 28; 4 components based on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]) responses were evaluated at each planned study visit in TP1. Immunogenicity samples (ADA/NAb samples) were collected at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 12 and 26 in TP1. Drug concentration samples were collected at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 26 in TP1. Safety laboratory samples were collected at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 26 in TP1. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed at each clinical visit. Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): This study originally planned to enroll approximately 560 subjects; the actual number of subjects randomized was 597 (297 and 300 subjects in the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU arms, respectively). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion:  Male and female subjects aged 18 years or older at the time of informed consent.  Diagnosis of RA based on 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA for at least a 4-month duration.  Met Class I, II or III of the ACR 1991 Revised Criteria for Global Functional Status in RA.  Moderately to severely active RA disease as defined by the following criteria:  6 tender joints (of 68 assessed) and  6 swollen joints (of 66 assessed) and  hs–CRP 8 mg/L (0.8 mg/dL).  Subjects had to have received oral, subcutaneous (SC), or intramuscular methotrexate for at least 12 weeks and been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. The stable dose had to be 10 to 25 mg per week, with the exception of 6 to 25 mg per week where 6 mg per week was a recommended initial dose by local guidance or standard of care.  Stable dose of oral folic acid (at least 1 mg/day on 5 days per week) or oral folinic acid ( 5 mg once per week) supplementation for at least 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug. In countries which did not have approved folic acid 1 mg or folinic acid 5 mg presentations, a regimen of folic acid of at least5 mg weekly was acceptable. Study Treatment: initiated and maintained their study drug treatment with a uniform dose regimen at a dose of 40 mg every other week by SC injection, throughout the study treatment periods. Methotrexate: Subjects were required to continue their stable background regimen of oral or intramuscular methotrexate (10 to 25 mg/week, with the exception of 6 to 25 mg/week in geographic regions where 6 mg per week was a recommended initial dose by local guidance or standard of care) throughout the study. Dose reductions to as low as 7.5 mg/week (or as low as 6 mg/week in geographic regions where permitted by local guidance or standard of care) were allowed for subjects who experienced intolerance to methotrexate during the study, and the dose reduction had to be documented with the investigator’s medical justification. Subjects had to have received methotrexate for at least 12 weeks and be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. Subjects were not discontinued from study treatment following a justified dose reduction of methotrexate, unless the methotrexate was adjusted below the minimal required dosage level of 7.5 mg/week (or a dose as low as 6 mg/week in geographic regions where permitted by local guidance or standard of care). Folic/Folinic Acid Supplements: Subjects were also required to receive a stable background dose of oral folate or folinic acid supplementation throughout the study. Subjects had to have received an adequate stable dose of oral folate (at least 1 mg/day on 5 days per week) or oral folinic acid (5 mg once per week) for at least 21 days prior to first dose of study drug and continue on the regimen throughout the study treatment. In countries which did not have approved folic acid 1 mg or folinic acid 5 mg presentations, a regimen of folic acid at of at least 5 mg weekly was acceptable. Additional Background Therapies: Subjects were required to discontinue any second disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) with at least a 4-week (sulfasalazine or anti-malarials), 8-week (gold compounds, Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitor, other immunomodulators) or 12-week (alkylating agents or biologic drugs) washout prior to their first dose of study drug. Subjects could also be treated with additional concomitant therapies including low dose oral corticosteroids, 1 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, and non-opioid and allowed opioid analgesics, if meeting the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Tapering or discontinuation of any corticosteroid treatment was only allowed after Week 52 unless required for toxicity, and was to be performed slowly at the discretion of the investigator. Intra-articular corticosteroids and 1 course of oral corticosteroids were allowed as rescue therapy. the subject was required to select a regular day of the week for their every other week injections at home, starting on any day between study Day 9 (after assessments) and study Day 15. The dosing time for a study drug injection was recorded for all injections through Week 12 (primary endpoint), and thereafter injection time was only recorded for a study drug injection which preceded or followed a PK sample. Therefore, injection time was recorded on Day 1, Weeks 2-12, and Weeks 24, 26, 28, 30, 34, 36, 50, 52, 54, 56, 64, 66, and 76. Efficacy Endpoint: Primary endpoint: ACR20 (20% improvement as defined by ACR criteria) at Week 12. Safety Evaluations: The safety (secondary) endpoints (TP1) included safety measures that were characterized by type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness and relatedness of AEs and laboratory abnormalities. Statistical Methods: Efficacy The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all subjects who were randomized to study treatment. The ITT population was used as the primary analysis population. This population was used for subject accountability and all efficacy analyses. The proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was analyzed by calculating a point estimate with 95% and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference between the 2 treatment arms (PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU). CIs calculated by the score statistic method were used for the inference of the equivalence for the primary efficacy endpoint. Equivalence between the 2 arms would be declared if the 2-sided 95% CI fell within the symmetric equivalence margin (-14%, 14%); this approach was endorsed by European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endorsed the alternative approach where equivalence would be declared if the 2-sided 90% CI fell within the asymmetric equivalence margin (-12%, 15%). The primary analysis for ACR20 was performed with the missing data imputed using a non-responder imputation method. Safety Safety analyses were performed in the safety population which was defined as all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study treatment, analyzed by actual treatment received. Adverse Events: AEs were classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 20.0) classification system. The severity of AEs was graded according to (CTCAE) version 4.03 whenever possible. Laboratory Parameters: Laboratory abnormalities were summarized by treatment and visit. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 1231 subjects were screened after signing an informed consent form, of whom 597 subjects were randomized to receive study treatment. One (1 [0.3%]) subject in the adalimumab-EU arm was randomized but not dosed. Of the 596 randomized and dosed subjects, 297 received PF-06410293 and 299 received adalimumab-EU (Table 1). Demographic and baseline RA disease characteristics for TP1 are summarized in Table 2. Table 1.

The subject was counted only once for gastroenteritis which was a serious AE. d. One (1) subject in the PF-06410293 arm experienced 2 AEs: pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and pancytopenia; both were serious AEs. The subject was counted only once for pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, which was related to study drug. e. One (1) subject in the PF-06410293 arm experienced 2 AEs: Pyelonephritis acute and urosepsis; both were serious AEs and not related to study drug. The subject was counted only once. Death One (1) death due to myocardial infarction occurred in 1 subject in the adalimumab-EU treatment arm during TP1. In the opinion of the investigator, the death was unrelated to the study drug. Laboratory Parameters Without regard to baseline abnormalities, the proportion of subjects with laboratory abnormalities in the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU treatment arms, were 64% and 62%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the first 26 weeks (TP1) of dosing demonstrated no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy or safety between the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU treatment arms. PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU were generally safe and well-tolerated, and the safety profile was similar between the 2 treatment arms with no clinically meaningful differences observed during the first period of dosing.

Study Initiation Date, Primary Completion and Final Completion Dates: First Subject First Visit: 25 June 2015; Primary Completion Date: 31 August 2016; Last Subject Last Visit: 06 December 2017. Phase of Development: Phase 3/Comparative Efficacy and Safety Study Study Objectives: Primary Objective:  To compare the treatment efficacy between PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU (Humira sourced from the European Union [EU]) in subjects with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were treated with adalimumab in combination with methotrexate (MTX). Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU.  To evaluate the immunogenicity of PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU.  To evaluate the multiple composite and individual parameters of clinical response to treatment transition from adalimumab-EU to PF-06410293.  To evaluate the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU.  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) response in response to PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU. METHODS Study Design: This was a multi-national, 2-arm, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, population PK, and immunogenicity of PF-06410293 versus adalimumab-EU in combination with MTX to treat subjects with moderately to severely active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX therapy. This study was also designed to evaluate clinical response, safety and immunogenicity after study drug transition (randomized blind single transition) from adalimumab-EU to PF-06410293 after 6 or 12 months of adalimumab-EU treatment. Upon completion of screening procedures and joint counts on Study Day 1, eligible subjects who met all the inclusion and did not meet any exclusion criteria were randomized (1:1 ratio) into 1 of 2 study treatment arms to receive either PF-06410293 or adalimumab-EU (Figure 1). Study treatment was provided through 3 treatment periods.  Treatment Period 1 (TP1) began with the first dose of study drug at Week 0 (Day 1) and concluded with the completion of Week 26 pre-dose assessments. Subjects were blindly randomized into adalimumab-EU and PF-06410293 in a 1:1 ratio.  Treatment Period 2 (TP2) began with the study drug dosing for Week 26, and concluded with the completion of Week 52 pre-dose assessments. At the beginning of TP2, eligible subjects from the adalimumab-EU arm were blindly re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to remain on adalimumab-EU or transition to PF-06410293. Week 52 was the end of the blinded treatment periods in this study.  Treatment Period 3 (TP3) began with the Week 52 study drug dosing, with the last study drug dosing scheduled on Week 76, and with the end of treatment (EOT) visit on Week 78. At the beginning of TP3, all the remaining subjects on adalimumab-EU were switched to PF-06410293 (open label).  Follow-Up Period: 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug (up to Week 92).

Subjects were randomized into PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio prior to the first dosing on Day 1. Subjects initially assigned to the adalimumab-EU study arm were blindly re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio, with 50% of the subjects switching to PF-06410293 at Week 26 dosing and the other 50% of the subjects switching to PF-06410293 at Week 52 dosing. b. Subjects were required to return for an EOT visit at Week 78 or 2 weeks after last dose of study drug for an early terminated subject. Subjects were then asked to return to the clinic for final safety and immunogenicity follow-up at Week 82, or 4 weeks after the EOT visit for an early terminated subject. Additional brief physical examination could be performed at the EOT and/or post-treatment follow-up visits at the investigator’s discretion, as indicated by signs and symptoms of ongoing AEs. c. All subjects, including subjects who withdrew anytime during the study, would have telephone contact to record AEs and medications at 16 weeks (112 calendar days) after last dose of study medications. d. Visits should have occurred when scheduled, within the time window indicated in the column headings. On study drug dosing days, assessments including joint counts and questionnaires, and sampling were performed prior to dosing unless otherwise stated. Patient reported assessments, including PGA and PAAP VAS measures and HAQ-DI questionnaires, should have been performed prior to any other assessments. This required special attention to ensure subjects do not self-administer an adalimumab injection prior to the clinic visit. Additional unscheduled assessments were performed as clinically indicated. e. The screening window might have been extended beyond 21 days, without a deviation, to complete required procedures or to allow for final test results to become available. f. Viral disease screening, including hepatitis screening (HBsAg, HBcAb, HBsAb, and HCV Ab) and HIV screening (HIV-1 Ab and HIV-2 Ab). HIV screening (HIV-1 Ab and HIV-2 Ab) could have been performed by the central laboratory or a local laboratory (if required by local regulations) at screening or within 8 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug on Day 1 and results were available. g. Screening test for female subjects who were amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months at the time of study screening with no alternative pathological or physiological cause. A serum FSH level within the laboratory’s reference range was to confirm the subject’s non-childbearing status. h. Tuberculosis test used QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube Test and had to be performed within 8 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug on Day 1. i. Chest radiography (lateral and posterior-anterior views) had to be performed within a 12-week window prior to first dose of study drug on Day 1. j. Complete physical examination of major body systems, including body weight, with height measured at screening physical examination only. Additional brief physical examination could have been performed during the study at the investigator’s discretion, as indicated by signs and symptoms of ongoing AEs. k. Vital signs included blood pressure, respiratory and pulse rate, and body temperature. Blood pressure should have been taken from the subject in the supine position after the subject had been resting quietly for at least 5 minutes. l. Baseline body weight could have come from the screening complete physical examination. m. Pregnancy testing at screening in female subjects of childbearing potential by serum hCG test at the central laboratory. Table 1. Schedule of Activities -Continued Page 4 of 4 Abbreviations: AE=adverse event; EC=ethics committee; hCG=human chorionic gonadotropin; IRB=Institutional Review Board; SAE=serious adverse event; SC=subcutaneous; VAS=Visual Analog Scale. n. Pregnancy testing (hCG) after screening were performed locally using urine samples. Urine pregnancy testing could have been repeated or performed more frequently if required by IRB/ECs or local regulations, or if potential pregnancy was suspected. o. Baseline assessment was not required if screening assessments performed within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug on Day 1, and all results had been received at the site. p. Japan-only tests are summarized in the protocol. q. Serum samples were collected as close as possible prior to the next study drug SC administration, at a maximum of 48 hours prior to the next study drug administration. r. Serum samples were collected at clinic anytime during the study visit. s. All joint count assessments for an individual subject should have been performed by an independent blinded assessor. If study drug administration was scheduled on the same day, SC injection of adalimumab was held until the joint count assessments were complete. It was especially important for the same assessor to perform the evaluations at screening, baseline, and Week 12 to ensure the integrity of the entry criteria and primary endpoint. The same independent blinded assessor should have been used to perform the subject’s subsequent joint count assessments throughout the study whenever possible. All opioids including tramadol, and acetaminophen/paracetamol should have been held within the 24 hours prior to a scheduled joint assessment. t. Physician assessment should have been performed without knowledge of subject reported VAS assessments. u. Adalimumab was self-administered subcutaneously by study subjects using pre-filled syringes provided by the Sponsor. After training, the first SC injection had to be administered by the subject in the abdomen, while at the clinic under the supervision of the site’s investigator or designee. Injection dates, study drug container label number and in some cases injection time had to be recorded in a Subject Dosing Log. v. AEs including SAEs were collected from the time of informed consent until last subject visit/contact, including 16 weeks (112 calendar days) after last dose of study drug (for all subjects, see Footnote g), in-clinic follow-up study examinations up to and including Week 26 (for subjects discontinued before Week 26, see Footnote f), safety follow-up contact until Week 52 (for subjects discontinued before Week 52, see Footnote f), and any extended follow-up. w. Subjects who withdrew or discontinued study treatment before Week 26 dosing were required to return for study examinations up to and including Week 26. For subjects who discontinued dosing before Week 52, but did not withdraw consent for further contact and/or start participation in another trial, telephone contact was made to record AEs and medications at the Week 4, 8, 12, 26, 36, and 52 visits, if not completed on site in person. x. Concomitant medications were routinely collected from the time of informed consent form was signed through the final study visit/contact, including 16 weeks (112 calendar days) after last dose of study drug (for all subjects, see Footnote g), in-clinic follow-up study examinations up to and including Week 26 (for subjects discontinued before Week 26, see Footnote f), safety follow-up contact until Week 52 (for subjects discontinued before Week 52, see Footnote f), and any extended follow-up. This study originally planned to enroll approximately 560 subjects; the actual number of subjects randomized was 597 (297 and 300 subjects in the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU arms, respectively). Upon completion of TP1, 552 subjects were re-randomized into TP2; 507 of the 552 subjects enrolled in the final treatment period (TP3). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion:  Male and female subjects aged 18 years or older at the time of informed consent.  Diagnosis of RA based on 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA for at least a 4-month duration.  Met Class I, II or III of the ACR 1991 Revised Criteria for Global Functional Status in RA.  Moderately to severely active RA disease as defined by the following criteria:  6 tender joints (of 68 assessed) at both screening and baseline and  6 swollen joints (of 66 assessed) at both screening and baseline and  High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs–CRP) 8 mg/L (0.8 mg/dL) at screening, performed by the central laboratory.  Subjects had to have received oral, subcutaneous (SC), or intramuscular MTX for at least 12 weeks and been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. The stable dose had to be 10 to 25 mg per week, with the exception of 6 to 25 mg per week where 6 mg per week was a recommended initial dose by local guidance or standard of care.  Stable dose of oral folic acid (at least 1 mg/day on 5 days per week) or oral folinic acid ( 5 mg once per week) supplementation for at least 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug. In countries which did not have approved folic acid 1 mg or folinic acid 5 mg presentations, a regimen of folic acid of at least 5 mg weekly was acceptable. Study Treatment: PF-06410293 or Adalimumab-EU: After proper training on self-administration of study drug by SC injection using the pre-filled syringe (PFS), all subjects initiated and maintained their study drug treatment with a uniform dose regimen at a dose of 40 mg every other week by SC injection, throughout the study treatment periods. The study drug labelling during open label TP3 displayed the PF-06410293 name. Subjects were required to continue their stable background regimen of oral or intramuscular MTX (10 to 25 mg/week, with the exception of 6 to 25 mg/week in geographic regions where 6 mg per week was a recommended initial dose by local guidance or standard of care) throughout the study. Dose reductions to as low as 7.5 mg/week (or as low as 6 mg/week in geographic regions where permitted by local guidance or standard of care) were allowed for subjects who experienced intolerance to MTX during the study, and the dose reduction had to be documented with the investigator’s medical justification. Subjects had to have received MTX for at least 12 weeks and be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects were not discontinued from study treatment following a justified dose reduction of MTX, unless the MTX was adjusted below the minimal required dosage level of 7.5 mg/week (or a dose as low as 6 mg/week in geographic regions where permitted by local guidance or standard of care). Folic/Folinic Acid Supplements: Subjects were also required to receive a stable background dose of oral folate or folinic acid supplementation throughout the study. Subjects had to have received an adequate stable dose of oral folate (at least 1 mg/day on 5 days per week) or oral folinic acid (5 mg once per week) for at least 21 days prior to first dose of study drug and continued on the regimen throughout the study treatment. In countries which did not have approved folic acid 1 mg or folinic acid 5 mg presentations, a regimen of folic acid at of at least 5 mg weekly was acceptable. Additional Background Therapies: Subjects were required to discontinue any second disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) with at least a 4-week (sulfasalazine or anti-malarials), 8-week (gold compounds, Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitor, other immunomodulators) or 12-week (alkylating agents or biologic drugs) washout prior to their first dose of study drug. Subjects could also have been treated with additional concomitant therapies including low dose oral corticosteroids, 1 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, non-opioid and allowed opioid analgesics, if meeting the study inclusion and not meeting any exclusion criteria). Subjects could have additionally received low dose aspirin for cardiovascular use (325 mg per day). Tapering or discontinuation of any corticosteroid treatment was only allowed after Week 52 unless required for toxicity, and was to be performed slowly at the discretion of the investigator. Intra–articular corticosteroids and 1 course of oral corticosteroids were allowed as rescue therapy. During the safety follow-up period, subjects were not required to wait for 16 weeks to initiate additional DMARD/biological DMARD (bDMARD) treatment for RA after the final dose of study drug. If the subject’s physician initiated a DMARD or bDMARD (including the subject was required to select a regular day of the week for their every other week injections at home, starting on any day between Study Day 9 (after assessments) and Study Day 15. The dosing time for a study drug injection was recorded for all injections through Week 12 (primary endpoint), and thereafter injection time was only recorded for a study drug injection which preceded or followed a PK sample. Therefore, injection time was recorded on Day 1, Weeks 2-12, and Weeks 24, 26, 28, 30, 34, 36, 50, 52, 54, 56, 64, 66, and 76. Efficacy, Immunogenicity, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Endpoints: Primary Endpoint: ACR20 (20% or greater improvement as defined by American College of Rheumatology) at Week 12. Secondary Endpoints:  Incidence and titers of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (NAb).  Categorical and continuous measures of clinical efficacy, including ACR20 (at time points in addition to Week 12), ACR50, ACR70, change in DAS28-4 (CRP) (Disease Activity Score-28; 4 components using C-reactive protein), DAS28 remission (2.6), EULAR response, and ACR/EULAR remission, and change from baseline in individual components of the ACR response.  Serum drug concentrations. Safety Evaluations: The safety (secondary) endpoints included safety measures that were characterized by type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness and relatedness of AEs and laboratory abnormalities. Statistical Methods: Efficacy The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all subjects who were randomized to study treatment and was used as the primary analysis population for efficacy endpoints. This population was used for subject accountability and all efficacy analyses. The ITT population was the primary analysis population for ACR20 at Week 12. For the primary analysis, non-responder status was assigned to subjects who discontinued treatment earlier than Week 12 or had a missing Week 12 visit for any reason (non-responder imputation [NRI]). The proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was analyzed by calculating a point estimate with 95% and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference between the 2 treatment arms (PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU). CIs calculated by the score statistic method were used for the inference of the equivalence for the primary efficacy endpoint. Equivalence between the 2 arms would be declared if the 2-sided Agency (PMDA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endorsed the alternative approach where equivalence would be declared if the 2-sided 90% CI fell within the asymmetric equivalence margin (-12%, 15%). Descriptive statistics were presented for all secondary efficacy endpoints in the ITT population. Pharmacokinetics Subjects who were treated with PF-06410293 or adalimumab-EU, provided at least 1 post-dose drug concentration measurement, and had no major protocol deviations influencing the PK assessment were included in the population PK analysis. The drug concentration-time data were summarized by descriptive statistics according to visit and treatment. In addition, serum drug concentrations were summarized by ADA status (ADA+/-) and NAb status (NAb+/-). Pharmacodynamics The hs-CRP concentration-time data were summarized by descriptive statistics according to treatment. Immunogenicity Immunogenicity analysis was performed for the safety population. For the immunogenicity data, the percentage of subjects with positive ADA and NAb were summarized for each treatment. For subjects with positive ADA/NAb, magnitude (titer), maximum titer per subject were also described, as data permitted. Safety The safety population was defined as all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study treatment, analyzed by actual treatment received. All subjects treated with at least 1 dose of study drug were included in all safety analyses in the safety population. version 4.03 whenever possible. Hematology and chemistry laboratory data were summarized by treatment and visit. Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 1231 subjects were screened after signing an informed consent form, of whom 597 were randomized to receive study treatment. Of the 596 randomized and dosed subjects, 297 received PF-06410293 and 299 received adalimumab-EU (Table 2). A total of 286 (96.3%) subjects in the PF-06410293 arm and 273 (91.0%) subjects in the adalimumab-EU arm completed TP1. Eleven (11 [3.7%]) subjects in the PF-06410293 arm and 26 (8.7%) subjects in the adalimumab-EU arm did not complete TP1, of whom 6 (2.0%) subjects in the PF-06410293 arm and 14 (4.7%) subjects in the adalimumab-EU arm discontinued from study treatment during TP1 with EOT defined as the date of the final study drug injection, and remained in the study for safety follow-up. Fourteen (14 [4.7%]) subjects in the PF-06410293 arm and 31 (10.4%) subjects in the adalimumab-EU arm discontinued from study treatment during TP1 (Table 3). Of the 552 subjects re-randomized in TP2 (TP2 ITT population), 551 subjects were dosed including 283 subjects continuing PF-06410293, 135 subjects continuing adalimumab-EU and 133 subjects previously in the adalimumab-EU group who were blindly re-randomized to receive PF-06410293. Overall, 504 (91.3%) subjects completed TP2 including 258 (91.2%), 120 (88.9%) and 126 (94.0%) in the PF-06410293/PF-06410293, adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU and adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293 groups, respectively, with the last subject completing the Week 52 visit on 01 March 2017 (Table 4). Forty-seven (47 [8.5%]) subjects discontinued treatment during TP2: 25 (8.8%), 15 (11.1%) and 7 (5.3%) subjects in the PF-06410293/PF-06410293, adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU and adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293 groups, respectively (Table 5). A total of 507 subjects enrolled TP3: 259, 121 and 127 subjects in the PF-06410293/PF- 06410293/PF-06410293 (PF/PF/PF), Adalimumab-EU/Adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293 (EU/EU/PF) and Adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293/PF-06410293 (EU/PF/PF) groups, respectively, and 505 subjects received study treatment in TP3 (Table 6). Overall, 474 (93.5%) subjects completed TP3 with comparable completion rates observed in the 3 treatment groups. Thirty (30 [5.9%]) subjects discontinued treatment during TP3, at comparable rates in all treatment groups (Table 7).

Pharmacokinetic Results During TP1, the mean and median serum drug concentrations were numerically slightly higher for the PF-06410293 arm compared to the adalimumab-EU arm; however, given the considerable overlap in serum drug concentrations between the treatment arms and the high variability (post-baseline coefficient of variations [CVs] ranged from 48% to 75%) (Table 54) observed in the data, these numerical differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. During TP2, the mean and median serum drug concentrations were numerically slightly higher for the PF-06410293/PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293 groups as compared to the adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU group; however, given the considerable overlap in serum drug concentrations between the 3 treatment groups and the high variability (CVs ranged from 65% to 81%) (Table 55) observed in the data, these numerical differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. variability in serum drug concentrations was high, the means were generally comparable and there was considerable overlap in the data among the 3 treatment groups at each visit in TP3 and the follow-up period (Table 56).

Summary statistics were calculated by setting concentration values below the LLOQ (250 ng/mL) to 0. ADA positive or negative based on overall ADA (TP1, TP2 and TP3). TP3 included data from Week 56, Week 66, EOT/ET, and follow-up visits. Data from Week 52 represented samples obtained in TP2 prior to dosing, and are included here for completeness. Unplanned visit was not included in the table.

The incidence of ADA in the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU arms was similar at each visit during TP1, and overall rates (post-positive ADA during TP1) were 44.4% and 50.5%, respectively. Overall, 13.8% and 14.0% of the subjects tested positive for NAb in the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU arms, respectively, and NAb results were also balanced between treatment arms at all measured time points (Table 57). The overall TP2 incidence of a positive ADA test result was comparable among the 3 treatment groups (Table 58), at 47.3%, 54.1% and 45.9% in the PF-06410293/PF-06410293, adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU and adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293 groups, respectively. Overall during TP2, 16.3%, 13.3% and 12.0% of the subjects tested positive for NAb in the PF-06410293/PF-06410293, adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU and adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293 groups, respectively. The majority of ADA positive subjects in TP2 were previously ADA positive in TP1, with only 22 (7.8%), 11 (8.1%) and 2 (1.5%) subjects first developing a post-dose positive ADA test in TP2 in the PF-06410293/PF-06410293, adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU and adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293 groups, respectively. No subject with a first post-dose positive ADA test during TP2 tested positive for NAb in TP2. Overall, comparable ADA incidences were observed across the 3 treatment groups during TP3 and the follow-up period (Table 59), and during the entire study, regardless of whether there was a single transition from adalimumab-EU to PF-06410293 (Table 58 and Table 59). The overall NAb incidence was comparable among the treatment groups, with the majority of ADA positive subjects testing NAb negative. The proportion of NAb positive subjects as a percentage of the ADA positive subjects was comparable and generally less than 50% at each planned visit in all treatment arms for TP1, TP2 and TP3. In TP1, the titer distribution was generally similar between the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU arms for subjects who were ADA positive at each visit up to Week 26. Although inter-subject variability was somewhat high, the maximal NAb titer distribution was generally similar between the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU arms, especially at later time points. In TP2, the titer distribution in subjects who were ADA positive at the specified visits was comparable across the 3 treatment groups and generally stable over time. NAb titers in NAb positive subjects at the specified visits generally showed comparable results among all treatment groups, although inter-subject variability was somewhat high. The distribution of ADA and NAb titers was generally comparable across the 3 treatment groups in TP3. In all 3 TPs, the maximal ADA titers for each subject were evenly distributed across the 4 quartiles within each arm. Similar results were observed for maximal titers in NAb positive subjects.

Safety Results: During TP1, a total of 143 (48.1%) and 143 (47.8%) subjects reported 343 and 379 all-causality treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU treatment arms, respectively. During TP2, a total of 123 (43.5%), 60 (44.4%) and 51 (38.3%) subjects reported 243, 112 and 100 all-causality TEAEs in the PF-06410293/PF-06410293, adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU and adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293 treatment groups, respectively. During TP3 and the follow-up period, a total of 218 (43.2%) subjects reported 446 all-causality TEAEs. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) During TP1, 25 (4.2%) subjects reported all-causality treatment-emergent SAEs, including 1 fatality in the adalimumab-EU arm (12 [4.0%]) subjects in the PF-06410293 arm and 13 [4.3%] subjects in the adalimumab-EU arm) (Table 60). The SOC with the highest proportion of subjects with SAEs was Infections and Infestations (3 [1.0%] subjects each in the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU arms), and the most frequently reported PTs in that SOC were pneumonia/pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (1 [0.3%] subject in the PF-06410293 arm and 2 [0.7%] subjects in the adalimumab-EU arm). Incidences of treatment-emergent all-causality and treatment-related SAEs were comparable between the PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU treatment arms (Table 60 and Table 63). During TP2, all-causality treatment-emergent SAEs were reported by 13 (2.4%) subjects (4 [1.4%], 6 [4.4%], and 3 [2.3%] subjects in the PF-06410293/PF-06410293, adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU and adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293 treatment groups, respectively) (Table 61). The SOC with the highest proportion of subjects with SAEs was Infections and Infestations (1 [0.4%] subject in the PF-06410293/PF-06410293 group and 3 [2.2%] subjects in the adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU group). All treatment-emergent SAEs by PT were each reported by 1 subject (Table 61). Treatment-related (9 [3.5%], 9 [7.5%], and 3 [2.4%] subjects for the PF/PF/PF, EU/EU/PF and EU/PF/PF groups, respectively) (Table 62). The SOCs with the highest percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs were Infections and Infestations (4 [1.6%] subjects on PF/PF/PF, 2 [1.7%] subjects on EU/EU/PF and 1 [0.8%] subject on EU/PF/PF), and Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (1 [0.4%] subject on PF/PF/PF, 2 [1.7%] subjects on EU/EU/PF, and 1 [0.8%] subject on EU/PF/PF). Tonsillitis and RA were reported for 2 subjects and all other SAEs were reported for 1 subject. Treatment-related treatment- emergent SAEs are presented in Table 65.

CONCLUSIONS: Treatment Period 1 Results from the first 26 weeks of dosing demonstrated no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy, safety, PK, PD and immunogenicity between PF-06410293 and adalimumab-EU. Treatment Period 2 In the subjects who re-randomized into TP2, results from TP2 continued to show the absence of clinically meaningful differences in efficacy, safety, PK, PD and immunogenicity among the PF-06410293/PF-06410293, adalimumab-EU/adalimumab-EU, and adalimumab-EU/PF-06410293 groups. Treatment Period 3 Overall, in line with the findings from TP1 and TP2, results from the final period (TP3) support the efficacy and safety of PF-06410293 in subjects with moderately to severely active RA who were treated with PF-06410293 in combination with MTX. Furthermore, results from TP3 show the absence of clinically meaningful differences in efficacy, safety, independent of single treatment transition from adalimumab-EU to PF-06410293 at Week 52.

GENERIC DRUG NAME AND/OR COMPOUND NUMBER: PF-06410293 PROTOCOL NO.: B5381002 Substudy PROTOCOL TITLE: An Open-Label, Single Arm, Prefilled Pen Sub-Study in a Subset of Subjects Participating in Protocol B5381002 Study Centers: A total of 16 centers enrolled and dosed subjects: 9 in the United States (US), 4 in Poland, 1 in Czech Republic, and 2 in Lithuania. Study Initiation Date and Final Completion Date: 03 October 2016 to 16 May 2017 Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objectives: Primary Objective:  To evaluate the success of PF-06410293 administration by the subject with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or their non-healthcare professional caregiver using the prefilled pen (PFP) device. Secondary Objectives:  To describe the safety of PF-06410293 administration by the subject or their non-healthcare professional caregiver using the PFP device.  To determine the correct operation of the PF-06410293 PFP by examination of returned used devices. METHODS Study Design: This was an optional, open-label, single arm substudy for subjects enrolled in Study B5381002. In addition to the main study procedures and assessments, this substudy was implemented during open-label treatment with PF-06410293 in the second year (Treatment Period 3 [TP3]) of the main B5381002 study, to demonstrate whether substudy subjects or their non-healthcare professional caregiver could safely and effectively administer PF-06410293 with the Sponsor’s PFP device. Approximately 50 study subjects were planned to be enrolled and dosed in this substudy. If a subject enrolled and attempted but ultimately failed to inject a dose, the subject’s data was included in the substudy data, and an additional subject was to be enrolled in order to have 50 subjects both enrolled and dosed. After receiving 2 PF-06410293 doses using the standard prefilled syringe (PFS) during the contained an identical PFS. Substudy subjects received 6 consecutive bi-weekly PF-06410293 doses over a period of 10 weeks (from Week 56 to Week 66) using the PFP device. Following training, subjects or their non-healthcare professional caregiver were to administer the PF-06410293 dose using the PFP for all injections, including the injections at home (the second, fourth, and fifth substudy injections). The first, third, and sixth injections were administered at the study site under the supervision of the investigator or a designated observer. Participant (the actual PFP user) and investigator/designated observer observations of the success of PF-06410293 injections administered using the PFP were collected throughout the 10-week substudy period from all substudy subjects who had at least 1 attempted administration of study drug PF-06410293 using the PFP device. If the substudy subject or non-healthcare professional caregiver was unable to use the PFP at any time, the subject was to return to use of the PFS for the remainder of the main B5381002 study. Following successful completion of the substudy, the subjects had the choice of continued use of the PFP or returning to PFS use for the remainder of the main B5381002 study. The Schedule of Activities for the substudy is provided in Table 1. Abbreviations: HBA = home-based administration; OAT = Observer Assessment Tool; OSA = on-site administration; PAT = Participant Assessment Tool; PFP = prefilled pen; PK = pharmacokinetic; SC = subcutaneous. a. Substudy Day 1 occurred at Week 56 and substudy Day 71 occurred at Week 66 of the main B5381002 study. All B5381002 study visit procedures were also performed at these visits, including PK and immunogenicity samples. b. There was no study visits scheduled on these weeks. The subject or their non-healthcare professional caregiver administered the study drug at home within the visit window. The B5381002 Subject Dosing Log continued to be completed for all PFP injections, using the kit label number for the PFP. The PFP injection location (abdomen or thigh) was also recorded in the Subject Dosing Log comment field. c. Each substudy subject or their non-healthcare professional caregiver administered up to 6 consecutive bi-weekly doses of PF-06410293, as tolerated, using the PFP device. They also recorded the date that the injection was performed on the study drug container label. The first, third, and sixth injections had to be administered at the site under the supervision of the investigator or designated observer. The first injection was an abdominal injection. d. The PFP user (either substudy subject or their non-healthcare professional caregiver performing the injection) recorded the success of all PF-06410293 injections using the PFP device, immediately following each injection, using the PAT. The investigator or designee also observed and recorded the success of the first, third, and sixth injections performed at the investigative site using the OAT (while blinded to the PFP user’s assessment). Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): Approximately 50 study subjects were planned to be enrolled and dosed in this substudy. Refer to Table 2 for the actual number of subjects dosed and analyzed. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Eligible substudy subjects were active participants in Year 2 of the main B5381002 study and moving into open-label B5381002 TP3, who had evidence of a personally signed and dated substudy informed who did not require PFP administration instructions in a language other than English, Czech, Lithuanian or Polish. Study Treatment: Substudy subjects were to receive 6 consecutive bi-weekly PF-06410293 doses over a period of 10 weeks. The study drug was administered as a subcutaneous injection using the single-use PFP device containing a PF-06410293 PFS. PFP Device Injection Success Evaluation Endpoints: Primary Endpoint for PFP Device Injection Success Evaluations:  Delivery system success rate (DSSR) based on participant (actual PFP User) and investigator/designated observer observations of the success of PF-06410293 administration by PFP. Secondary Endpoints for PFP Device Injection Success Evaluations:  Characterization of unsuccessful PFP injections.  A determination, by inspection, of the correct mechanical function of returned PFP devices. Safety Evaluations: No additional safety assessments were performed in the substudy and limited reporting of TP3 safety for these subjects was planned for the substudy. Safety evaluations included vital signs, adverse events (AEs) including injection site reactions (ISRs) and safety laboratory tests. Full safety data on substudy subjects will be reported in the final B5381002 study report. Safety endpoint (secondary):  Safety as measure by type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness and relatedness of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), abnormalities and laboratory parameters. Statistical Methods: PFP Device Injection Success Analysis: All endpoints related to Participant Assessment Tool (PAT) or Observer Assessment Tool (OAT) were summarized within the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which was defined as all substudy subjects who attempted to administer at least 1 dose of PF-06410293 using the PFP device. No formal statistical hypothesis was tested for the substudy data. All data were summarized using descriptive statistics. No imputation of missing data was planned. The percent variables calculated at each PFP injection visit were based on the number of subjects who attempted an injection at the visit. Analysis of Primary Endpoint for PFP Device Injection Success: The DSSR was defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved delivery success for an attempted injection at each  For injections performed at the study site (first, third, and sixth injections by PFP), a ‘Yes’ for Question 1 from the investigator/designated observer on the OAT.  Based on lack of injection failure reported on the PAT:  A ‘No’ for any of the Questions 4, 5 or 6 would indicate injection failure; a ‘Yes’ for all 3 questions would indicate injection success.  Question 7 ‘Yes - medicine was still flowing out the pen after it was withdrawn from the skin’ signals injection failure; a ‘No’ for this question would indicate injection success. Manual review and adjudication of injection success was required for the following PAT responses: Question 7 ‘Yes – I could not get the cap off.’ or if Question 7 ‘Other’ open text field had an entry. If the subject engaged in multiple PFP injection attempts at a visit, only the first attempt (ie, the first PFP) was to be included in the calculation of the DSSR at the visit; the second attempt (ie, use of a second PFP) was to be included in subject listings but not in the statistical summary. The DSSR at each visit was accompanied by an exact, 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI), using the Clopper-Pearson method (the Clopper-Pearson limits for a proportion was multiplied by 100 to obtain the CI for the percent). An overall DSSR (ie, combined across visits as a secondary representation of DSSR, for the attempted injections) and the 95% CI were to be obtained from a clustered binomial analysis using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) binomial model with logit link and working correlation structure of independence. As 100% of the injection attempted were successful, the 95% CI for the overall DSSR could not be calculated from the GEE model. Counts and percentages were presented, at each scheduled on-site injection visit, for each category of each OAT and PAT question. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints for PFP Device Injection Success: Characterization of unsuccessful PFP injections was descriptive and correlated with the inspection of returned PFPs. Determination of the correct mechanical function of returned PFP devices was to be described by visual inspection and an industrial computed tomography (CT) scan, and summarized in an inspection report, which was to include a list of any injections where the inspection demonstrated failure to inject the complete injection volume although the clinical assessment using PAT and OAT was reported as successful. Safety Analysis: The safety population was defined as substudy subjects who received at least a portion of a dose of PF-06410293 using the PFP device. Limited safety summaries and summaries of baseline characteristics were planned for this substudy, within the safety population. Subject Disposition and Demography: The end of substudy subject summary is provided in Table 2. A total of 63 subjects were screened after signing a substudy informed consent form, of whom 50 subjects entered the substudy and received substudy treatment using the PFP. Of the 50 treated substudy subjects, 1 (2.00%) subject discontinued from both the substudy and the main B5381002 study after 3 PFP injections (following withdrawal of consent). A total of 49 (98.00%) subjects completed the substudy, and 47 (95.92%) of them selected the PFP device for continued B5381002 study treatment. The 50 treated subjects consisted of 13 (26.0%) males and 37 (74.0%) females. The majority of the subjects (46/50, 92.0%) were White. The mean age at B5381002 Study screening was 54.9 years (range: 24 to 75 years). The mean weight and body mass index (BMI) at B5381002 Study Week 52 (ie, substudy screening) were 80.9 kg (range: 50.0 to 139.3 kg) and 29.1 kg/m2 (range: 16.3 to 49.4 kg/m2), respectively. The majority of the subjects (46/50, 92.0%) were right handed. None of the 50 treated subjects experienced use of an autoinjector or injection pen prior to participation in this substudy. The distribution of the 50 treated subjects included 38.0% in Poland, 28.0% in the US, 20.0% in Czech Republic, and 14.0% in Lithuania. Table 2.

On B5381002 Study Day 1, mean RA duration was 8.0 years. A total of 3 (6.0%) subjects had lower extremity replaced/fused joints. Mean swollen and tender joint counts were 16.8 (anti-CCP) antibody were 257.6 IU/mL and 287.5 U/mL, respectively. Mean high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was 24.7 mg/L. At B5381002 Study Week 52 (ie, substudy screening), mean swollen and tender joint counts were decreased to 1.9 and 5.4, respectively, and mean DAS28-CRP was decreased to 2.87. Mean Week 52 RF, anti-CCP antibody, and hs-CRP were 148.6 IU/mL, 296.2 U/mL, and 6.9 mg/L, respectively. PFP Device Injection Success Evaluation Results: Primary Endpoint: The DSSR based on participant (the actual PFP user) and investigator/designated observer observations of the success of PF-06410293 administration by PFP is summarized in Table 3. Statistical analysis of DSSR is provided in Table 4. All actual PFP users successfully administered PF-06410293 by PFP at each visit. The DSSR at each visit was 100.0% with the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI exceeding 92% and the upper bound being 100.0%. All of the 294 attempted injections were successful, resulting in an overall DSSR across visits of 100.0%. Table 3.

A summary of the OAT responses is provided in Table 5 for the 3 on-site substudy injection visits at Weeks 56, 60 and 66. There were 5 subjects who could not attend the on-site visit at Week 60 and instead, performed the injection with OAT assessment at Week 62. These 5 OAT assessments were successful and included in the OAT contribution to overall success but not included in the OAT summary by scheduled visit. The OAT observers recorded all injections as successful. Specific non-physical (verbal) help was reported by the observer for 3 (6.0%) subjects at Week 56 and 1 (2.3%) subject at Week 60. Table 5.

Week 60 OAT for 5 subjects were collected at Week 62; the successful injection at this visit was not included in the OAT summary but was included in the OAT contribution to overall success. The actual PFP user for the first injection at Week 56 consisted of 48 (96.0%) substudy subjects and 2 (4.0%) non-healthcare professional caregivers (a relative or friend). No actual PFP user switched from subject to non-healthcare professional caregiver, or vice versa, for the subsequent substudy visits. The PFP users answered all PAT questions as required to indicate injection success. A total of 3 PFP users entered open text information in the PAT Question 7 ‘Other’ field, of whom 2 subjects received verbal help with 1 or more of the instruction steps during the substudy. with injection success. The Question 7 ‘Other’ comments included: ‘first attempt could not press button down’; ‘second attempt with same pen was successful’; ‘couldn’t hear the first click’; ‘making sure it’s in’; and ‘it is stiff and hard to get button to press down’. Secondary Endpoints: A total of 292 used PFPs were returned to the Sponsor and analysis of all these PFPs demonstrated complete injection of the full volume for used PFPs, including all PFPs used for injections with OAT or PAT comments. There were no medical device complaints or failed injection attempts for the inspection report to correlate with the inspection findings. CT scans documented a bent needle after use in 5 (1.7%) of the returned used PFPs. Safety Results: There were no deaths, ISRs, or permanent discontinuations due to TEAEs reported during this substudy. A total of 2 (4.0%) subjects had temporary discontinuation of study medication (1 injection not performed) due to a TEAE. Treatment-emergent non-serious AEs are summarized in Table 6 (all-causality). All reported non-serious TEAEs were considered unrelated to treatment with the exception of a single Grade 1 event of upper respiratory tract infection. The most frequently reported TEAE was viral upper respiratory tract infection (5 [10.0%] subjects); all other TEAEs were reported by no more than 2 subjects. Treatment-emergent serious AEs (SAEs) are summarized in Table 7 (all-causality). There were 3 SAEs reported during the substudy, all of which were Grade 3 and considered unrelated to treatment. No subjects reported Grade 4 or higher TEAEs. No clinically significant findings were noted for vital signs or laboratory data.

CONCLUSIONS:  The DSSR at each visit and overall DSSR were 100.0%. All actual PFP users successfully administered each of the 294 PF-06410293 injection attempts by the PFP. The actual PFP user for the first injection at Week 56 consisted of 48 (96.0%) substudy versa, for the subsequent substudy visits.  The inspection of all 292 used PFPs confirmed successful injection of the full drug volume for all returned used PFPs.  The primary issue during injection attempts for the few injections requiring verbal help (OAT) or noted by the actual PFP user (PAT) was difficulty pushing the PFP down hard enough to unlock the injection button.  A high proportion of completed substudy subjects (95.92%) selected to continue PFP injections for the remainder of the B5381002 study treatment.  Subcutaneous injections of PF-06410293 by the subject or their non-healthcare professional caregiver using the PFP device were generally safe and well tolerated in the RA subjects investigated in this substudy.  The AEs (including SAEs) reported for the substudy population were consistent with those reported for the first year of the overall B5381002 study population.  There were no ISRs reported during the substudy.
