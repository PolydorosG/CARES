Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation Date: 08 November 2016 Study Completion Date: 20 July 2021 Report Date: 07 December 2021 Previous Report Date(s): Not Applicable. Phase of Development: Phase 2. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: The study objectives and endpoints are presented in Table S1. Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This was a single-arm, open-label, extended treatment, safety study in patients treated with talazoparib as a single agent or in combination with another agent in qualifying originating talazoparib use were to be evaluated with the data collected limited to safety assessments. The study provided access to single-agent talazoparib for qualifying patients who may benefit from continuing therapy with talazoparib. Study assessments included AEs, local clinical laboratory tests, concomitant medications, physical examinations, and vital signs (and weight). Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry) were to be performed every 4 weeks through Week 25 and every 8 weeks thereafter during the study. Complete blood count (CBC) tests were to be completed every 2 weeks through Week 9 and every 4 weeks thereafter. Women of childbearing potential had to have a pregnancy test every 4 weeks. Safety follow-up was to be through and including 30 days after the last dose of talazoparib. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Eligible patients must have received talazoparib as a single agent or in combination with another agent in a qualifying Medivation/Pfizer-sponsored study in advanced solid tumors and have no ongoing Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 talazoparib-related toxicities. All patients must provide signed informed consent. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) must be ≤2. Patients must have tolerated ≥0.25 mg/day talazoparib during the originating study. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before entering the study, be willing to have additional pregnancy tests while receiving talazoparib and agree to avoid pregnancy by using a highly effective birth control method from the first dose of talazoparib through 7 months after the last dose. Male patients must use a condom when having sex with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential from the first dose of talazoparib through 4 months after the last dose. Patients who permanently discontinued from any Medivation/Pfizer-sponsored study with talazoparib alone or in combination with another agent or who received an antineoplastic therapy after treatment with talazoparib in the originating study were excluded. Study Treatment: The maximum starting dose of talazoparib was to be 1 mg/day or the last tolerated dose administered in the originating study. Talazoparib capsules were to be administered by mouth once daily with or without food at approximately the same time of day. Patients receiving talazoparib as combination treatment in the originating study were to receive talazoparib as a single agent in this extended treatment study. Talazoparib administration could continue as long as the investigator considered treatment to be providing clinical benefit or until other study discontinuation criteria were met. The addition of any other antineoplastic therapy and the concurrent use of investigational agents during the study were prohibited. Patients continued receiving talazoparib as long as the investigator considers treatment to be providing clinical benefit or until other study discontinuation criteria were met. The study could have continued until the last patient had stopped deriving clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator or until the last patient met other study discontinuation criteria (anticipated to be approximately 4 years).

Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Evaluations: Not Applicable. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included AEs, vital signs, weight, and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: All safety analyses were conducted using the safety population defined as all patients who received any amount of talazoparib. Safety was evaluated using summaries of AEs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests. Treatment-emergent safety data were collected from the first dose of talazoparib through and including 30 days after the last dose. Drug exposure was summarized using descriptive statistics. All AEs were coded to preferred term and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and classified by severity using CTCAE. The number and percentage of patients with AEs were presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study treatment, severity, seriousness, and outcome (eg, leading to permanent treatment discontinuation). Descriptive statistics were used. Laboratory values were classified for severity using the CTCAE. Laboratory shift tables of baseline results versus postbaseline results were produced as appropriate. RESULTS Patient Disposition and Demography: Of 120 patients enrolled in the study, 118 received study treatment. All patients discontinued from the study treatment (Table S3). The most frequently reported reason for treatment discontinuation is disease progression (85 [70.8%] patients). Ten (8.3%) patients discontinued from study treatment due to AEs. All enrolled patients had signed the informed consent form (120 patients in total). A total of 118 patients received talazoparib and were included in the safety population.

The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 AE was anaemia (24 [20.3%] patients). The most frequently reported study drug-related AEs (10% of patients) were anaemia (35 [29.7%] patients), nausea (17 [14.4%] patients), fatigue (16 [13.6%] patients), thrombocytopenia (15 [12.7%] patients) and neutropenia (14 [11.9%] patients). The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related AE was anaemia (24 [20.3%] patients). Overall, 56 (47.5%) patients reported at least 1 AE of ‘cytopenia’. The most frequently reported preferred terms associated with myelosuppression were anaemia (39 [33.1%] patients), thrombocytopenia (17 [14.4%] patients) and neutropenia (14 [11.9%] patients). Grade 3 or 4 anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported for 24 (20.3%), 6 (5.1%) and 7 (5.9%) patients, respectively. AEs of special interest included acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), pneumonitis and venous thrombotic event (VTE). MDS was analyzed by the standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) of ‘myelodysplastic syndrome’ and AML was analyzed using selected AML-related preferred terms. VTE was analyzed by the modified SMQ of ‘embolic and thrombotic events, venous’.  Overall, 1 (0.8%) patient developed a Grade 4 AE of leukaemia, which was an SAE and considered as possibly related to study drug in addition to other factors such as past chemotherapy (paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin and vinorelbine) by the investigator. Study drug was permanently withdrawn in response to the SAE. The event was still ongoing at the time of last report.  No patients had reported AEs identified by the search of SMQ ‘myelodysplastic syndrome’ for MDS.  A total of 3 (2.5%) patients had an event of VTE, including 2 non-serious AEs of thrombophlebitis superficial and 1 non-serious AE of pulmonary embolism. One of the AEs of thrombophlebitis superficial was considered possibly related to study drug, the other AE of thrombophlebitis superficial and the AE of pulmonary embolism were not considered related to study drug. Fatal AEs occurred in 14 (11.9%) patients, with majority of deaths attributed to disease progression (4 [3.4%] patients). None of the fatal AEs were considered related to study drug. One additional fatal AE, a cerebrovascular accident, was reported beyond the 30-day period from the last dose, and was considered not related to study drug. Overall, SAEs were reported for 45 (38.1%) patients. The most frequently reported SAEs were anaemia, disease progression and dyspnoea (4 [3.4%] patients each). Study drug-related SAEs were reported for 9 (7.6%) patients. Anaemia (4 [3.4%] patients) was the most frequently reported study drug-related SAE. The incidence of AEs associated with permanent study drug discontinuation was low overall (9 [7.6%] patients). A total of 51 (43.2%) patients experienced AEs associated with dose interruptions, with the most frequently reported being anaemia (13 [11.0%] patients). A total of 13 (11.0%) patients experienced AEs associated with dose reductions, with the most frequently reported being anaemia (6 [5.1%] patients). No patients on the study met the criteria for Hy’s Law. The most frequently reported hematology parameter abnormalities that increased 2 or more toxicity grades from baseline were low hemoglobin (22 [18.6%] patients), low leukocytes (22 [18.6%] patients), low neutrophils (20 [16.9%] patients). Overall, the incidence of chemistry parameter abnormalities was low; the chemistry parameter abnormalities that increased 2 or more toxicity grades from baseline included high alkaline phosphatase (2 [1.7%] patients), high bilirubin (2 [1.7%] patients), and high creatinine (1 [0.8%] patient). The incidence of potentially clinically significant changes in vital signs and weight was low. Conclusion: Overall, the safety profile of talazoparib is consistent with the previously reported safety profile. No new safety signals were identified.
