Objectives, Endpoints, and Statistical Methods: The objectives and endpoints of the study are presented in Table S1. Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints Safety PK Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; AUC = area under the plasma concentration time profile from time zero inf extrapolated to infinite time; AUC = unbound area under the plasma concentration time profile from time inf,u zero extrapolated to infinite time; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time zero to last the time of the last quantifiable concentration; AUC = unbound area under the plasma concentration-time last,u profile from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration; CL/F = apparent clearance of drug from plasma; CL /F = unbound apparent clearance from plasma; C = maximum observed concentration; u max C = unbound maximum plasma concentration; ECG = electrocardiogram; f = fraction unbound; PK = max,u u pharmacokinetic; t = terminal phase half-life; T = time to reach C , V /F = apparent volume of ½ max max z distribution; V /F = unbound apparent volume of distribution. z,u Statistical methods are summarized below: A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), that included all 4 groups in the same model, was used to compare the natural log transformed of C , AUC , AUC and f of danuglipron max inf last u separately, for each of the hepatic impairment groups (Test, Groups 2, 3, 4) to the healthy normal hepatic function group (Reference, Group 1). C , AUC , and AUC were also max,u inf,u last,u analyzed with an ANOVA. C , AUC , AUC , f , C , AUC , AUC , CL/F, CL /F, V /F, V /F, T , and t max inf last u max,u inf,u last,u u z z,u max ½ were listed, summarized descriptively, and analyzed by group for participants in the PK parameter set. Any clinical laboratory, ECG, blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate abnormalities of potential clinical concern were described. No formal analyses were planned for safety data. Methodology: This was a non-randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel-cohort, multicenter study to investigate the effect of varying degrees of hepatic function on the plasma PK of danuglipron after a single, oral 20 mg dose administered in the fed state. Safety and tolerability were evaluated throughout the study. A total of 24 participants with varying degrees of hepatic function (6 participants per group) were administered a single, oral dose of danuglipron 20 mg in the fed state as planned. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): Approximately 24 participants were planned to be enrolled to study intervention such that approximately 24 evaluable participants were to complete the study. A total of 24 participants were assigned to treatment and all were treated. All 24 participants were included in the safety analysis set, PK concentration set, and PK parameter set. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Adult participants with or without hepatic impairment were enrolled in this study. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): Danuglipron was supplied by Pfizer as 10 mg tablets in bulk along with individual dosing containers, as necessary, for unit dosing. For the 20 mg dose administered in this study, participants took 2 tablets of danuglipron with the morning meal. The manufacturing lot numbers for the study intervention dispensed in this study are provided in Table S2. Table S2.

Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics:  Across the 4 hepatic function groups, the mean (range) age was 58.7 (45.0, 70.0) years, 13 participants (54.2%) were male and 11 female (45.8%), and most (22/24, 91.7%) participants were White.  The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar across the 4 hepatic function groups. Exposure:  All 24 participants received danuglipron 20 mg single dose. Safety Results:  No deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), severe AEs, or discontinuations from the study due to AEs were reported in the study. As this was a single-dose study, temporary discontinuations or dose reduction due to AEs were not applicable.  A total of 5 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in the study. All were mild in severity.  No TEAEs occurred in the normal hepatic function group. A total of 1, 2, and 2 TEAEs were reported in 1, 2, and 1 participant(s) in the mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment groups, respectively. All TEAEs were considered treatment-related.  All 5 TEAEs reported in 4 participants were in the gastrointestinal disorders system organ class (SOC). Nausea was reported in 3 participants, 2 in the moderate hepatic impairment group, and 1 in the severe hepatic impairment group. Diarrhea was reported in 1 participant in the mild hepatic impairment group. Vomiting was reported in 1 participant in the severe hepatic impairment group.  No medication errors were reported.  The most commonly reported laboratory abnormalities, reported in at least 3 (12.5%) participants, were platelets <0.5 × lower limit of normal (LLN), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) >1.1 × upper limit of normal (ULN), prothrombin time (PT) >1.1 × ULN, prothrombin international normalized ratio (PT/INR) >1.1 × ULN, bilirubin >1.5 × ULN, direct bilirubin >1.5 × ULN, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) >3 × ULN, albumin <0.8 × LLN, urine hemoglobin ≥1, urine urobilinogen ≥1. As expected, a higher proportion of laboratory abnormalities in liver tests were observed in participants with severe hepatic impairment compared to participants in the other 3 groups.  Increases in blood pressure from baseline (≥20 mm Hg in sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] or ≥30 mm Hg in sitting systolic blood pressure [SBP]) were observed in the normal hepatic function group and moderate and severe hepatic impairment groups, and low blood pressure (sitting DBP <50 mm Hg or sitting SBP <90 mmHg) was observed in the severe hepatic impairment group.  QTcF value >450 milliseconds and ≤480 milliseconds was observed in 5 participants across the three hepatic impairment groups, and PR interval baseline >200 milliseconds and ≥25% increase from baseline or baseline ≤200 milliseconds and ≥50% increase was observed in 1 participant in the severe hepatic impairment group. However, these ECG findings were not clinically meaningful. Pharmacokinetic Results: Plasma danuglipron exposure based on AUC , AUC , and C increased with decreased inf last max hepatic function. Adjusted geometric mean Test/Reference ratios (90% confidence interval [CI]) for AUC comparing the varying degrees of hepatic impairment (Test) to normal inf hepatic function (Reference) were 122.70% (61.33%, 245.49%), 282.73% (141.32%, 565.66%), and 640.78% (320.27%, 1282.00%) for participants with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively; and the corresponding ratios (90% CI) for AUClast were 122.89% (61.51%, 245.51%), 283.88% (142.10%, 567.13%), and 636.32% (318.51%, 1271.24%), respectively. Adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% CI) for C were 133.17% max (81.97%, 216.37%), 219.98% (135.39%, 357.41%), and 334.21% (205.70%, 543.00%) for participants with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Fraction unbound values were similar in the normal hepatic function and mild and moderate hepatic impairment groups and slightly higher in the severe hepatic impairment group. Relative to the normal hepatic function group, the adjusted geometric mean Test/Reference ratios (90% CI) for f were 85.19% (63.60%, 114.10%), 96.37% (71.95%, 129.07%), and u 135.20% (100.94%, 181.10%) for participants with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Similar to total plasma danuglipron exposure, plasma unbound danuglipron exposure based on AUC , AUC , and C increased with decreased hepatic function. Relative to the inf,u last,u max,u normal hepatic function group, adjusted geometric mean Test/Reference ratios (90% CI) for AUC were 104.59% (48.76%, 224.31%), 272.28% (126.95%, 583.96%), and 866.17% inf,u (403.86%, 1857.71%) for participants with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively; and the corresponding ratios (90% CI) for AUC were 104.87% (48.87%, last,u 225.04%), 273.63% (127.51%, 587.20%), and 861.63% (401.52%, 1849.01%), respectively. Adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% CI) for C were 113.43% (64.71%, 198.84%), max,u 211.96% (120.91%, 371.57%), and 451.66% (257.65%, 791.75%) for participants with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Conclusions: PK  Following a single 20 mg oral dose, plasma exposure for danuglipron based on AUCinf, AUC and C increased with decreased hepatic function. Relative to the normal last max hepatic function group, the adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) for AUC were inf 122.70% (61.33%, 245.49%), 282.73% (141.32%, 565.66%), and 640.78% (320.27%, 1282.00%) in mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment groups, respectively. Similar ratios were observed for AUC . The corresponding ratios (90% CIs) for C last max were 133.17% (81.97%, 216.37%), 219.98% (135.39%, 357.41%) and 334.21% (205.70%, 543.00%), in mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment groups, respectively.  Plasma danuglipron f values were generally similar in participants with normal hepatic u function, mild and moderate hepatic impairment and slightly higher in participants with severe hepatic impairment. The adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% CI) were 85.19% (63.60%, 114.10%), 96.37% (71.95%, 129.07%), and 135.20% (100.94%, 181.10%) for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment groups, respectively relative to normal hepatic function group.  Plasma unbound danuglipron exposure based on AUC , AUC and C increased inf,u last,u max,u with decreased hepatic function. Relative to the normal hepatic function group, the adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) for AUC were 104.59% (48.76%, inf,u 224.31%), 272.28% (126.95%, 583.96%), and 866.17% (403.86%, 1857.71%) in mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment groups, respectively. Similar ratios were observed for AUC . The ratios (90% CIs) for C were 113.43% (64.71%, last,u max,u 198.84%), 211.96% (120.91%, 371.57%) and 451.66% (257.65%, 791.75%) in mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment groups, respectively, relative to the normal hepatic function group. Safety  Single oral dose of danuglipron 20 mg was generally safe and well-tolerated when administered to adult participants with varying degrees of hepatic impairment and in age- and body weight-matched participants without hepatic impairment; all reported TEAEs were mild, gastrointestinal events in agreement with the known safety profile of danuglipron.
