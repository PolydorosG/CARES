Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation and Completion Dates: Study initiation date (First Subject First Visit): 26 October 2016 Primary completion date: 31 May 2018 Study completion date (Last Subject Last Visit): 22 August 2018 Report Date: 30 May 2019 Previous Report Date(s): Not applicable Phase of Development: Phase 2a Study Objectives: Primary Objectives:  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06480605 in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC).  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06480605 in induction of endoscopic improvement (as assessed by Mayo endoscopic subscore) at Week 14 in subjects with moderate to severe UC. Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06480605 in induction of remission at Week 14 (defined as a total Mayo score 2 with no individual subscore >1) in subjects with moderate to severe UC.  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06480605 in induction of endoscopic remission at Week 14 (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0) in subjects with moderate to severe UC.  To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-06480605 in subjects with moderate to severe UC.  To evaluate the immunogenicity of PF-06480605 in subjects with moderate to severe UC.  To evaluate disease and pathway related biomarkers (ie, high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and fecal calprotectin), and serum total soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like ligand 1A (TL1A) (sTL1A). METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 2a, single arm, 2-stage study in subjects with moderate to severe UC. Subjects received 500 mg of PF-06480605 intravenously once every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a total of 7 doses. At the end of the first stage (12 evaluable subjects with a Week 14 colonoscopy), an interim analysis was performed for an early efficacy assessment. Enrollment in the second stage was stopped if the futility criteria were met and any ongoing subjects in the second stage were moved to the follow-up period. Otherwise, the study continued to enroll additional subjects in the second stage for final efficacy assessment. An early PK readout of PF-06480605 serum concentrations was conducted after 6 subjects had completed the Week 4 visit. The analysis was done by the team clinical pharmacologist who confirmed that the predicted exposures of PF-06480605 in subjects with UC were consistent with expected values based on the healthy subject PK data. Therefore, no dose adjustments were made. The study included an additional research component involving collection of biological samples and immunogenicity analysis. Individual stopping rules were implemented to further evaluate safety and feasibility of study continuation as described below:  If 2 subjects receiving PF-06480605 developed the same adverse laboratory event with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 4.03) Grade 3 or higher, or if 1 subject developed a laboratory adverse event (AE) with a CTCAE Grade 4 or higher, then the study might be terminated.  If 2 subjects experienced an electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality defined as a prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) calculated using Fridericia’s correction factor (QTcF) of >500 msec over baseline assessment, then the study might be terminated. If a single subject experienced a prolonged QTcF of >500 msec over baseline assessment, then this subject would be discontinued from the study. The duration of participation for eligible subjects was approximately 8 months, including a Screening period of up to 6 weeks, a 12-week treatment period, and a follow-up period ending 14 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Subjects with AEs as a result of positive ADA/neutralizing antibody (NAb) might be requested to return for additional follow-up for up to 3 months after the follow-up/end-of-study visit. During the treatment period, subjects visited the site every 2 weeks (±3 days) for investigational product administration (7 visits), and then returned to the site every 4 weeks (±7 days) through Week 24 and again at Week 26 for follow-up visits (5 visits). This study was estimated to complete in approximately 32 months, maximum, allowing for an estimated 18-24 months of enrollment and approximately 8 months on study. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Male and female subjects between 18 and 75 years of age at the time of informed consent (subjects enrolled in Republic of Korea had to be 19 to 75 years of age at the time of informed consent).  A diagnosis of UC for 4 months.  Subjects with moderate to severe active UC as defined (via Screening colonoscopy) by a total Mayo score of 6, with a rectal bleeding subscore of 1 and an endoscopic subscore of 2 on the Mayo.  Subjects were required to have inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to at least 1 conventional therapy for UC, including steroids, immunosuppressants, anti-TNF inhibitors and anti-integrin inhibitors. For subjects in Netherlands, they were required to have inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to at least 1 biological therapy, such as an anti-TNF inhibitor.  Main criteria for exclusion:  Subjects with a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis, ischemic colitis, radiation colitis, diverticular disease associated with colitis, microscopic colitis, Crohn’s disease (CD), or clinical findings suggestive of CD (eg, fistulae, granulomas on biopsy).  Subjects with colonic dysplasia or neoplasia, toxic megacolon, primary sclerosing cholangitis, known colonic stricture, a history of colonic or small bowel stoma, or a history of colonic or small bowel obstruction or resection.  Prior evidence of liver injury or toxicity due to methotrexate. Study Treatment: PF-06480605 (500 mg) was administered intravenously as a 60-minute infusion using a calibrated infusion pump at Day 1, Week 2 (Day 15), Week 4 (Day 29), Week 6 (Day 43), Week 8 (Day 57), Week 10 (Day 71) and Week 12 (Day 85) ± 3 days during the study for a total of up to 7 doses. Investigational product administration was required to occur following most study procedures and not to be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. Subjects were required to remain at the study site for a minimum period of at least 2 hours for observation following the end of administration of PF-06480605 infusion.

Investigational Product Description Investigational Product Strength/Potency Dosage Form Description PF-06480605 powder for solution 100 mg/vial Lyophile for injection, 100 mg/vial PF-06480605 powder for solution 100 mg/vial Lyophile for injection, 100 mg/vial Efficacy Evaluations: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Endoscopic improvement at Week 14 (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, and without friability). Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  Remission at Week 14 (defined as a total Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore >1).  Endoscopic remission at Week 14 (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0). Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Immunogenicity Evaluations: Pharmacokinetics: Blood samples (3 mL) to provide approximately 1.2 mL serum for PK analysis were collected into appropriately labeled tubes on Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 141, 169, and 183, and at early withdrawal visit. Serum samples were analyzed for PF-06480605 concentrations using a validated, sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method in compliance with the sponsor standard operating procedures (SOPs). The following PF-06480605 PK parameters on Day 85 (Table S2) following multiple intravenous dosing were calculated for each subject within the treatment, as applicable, using non-compartmental analysis of concentration-time data.

If data permitted. Pharmacodynamics: A stool sample for determination of fecal calprotectin was obtained on Days 1, 15, 57, 85 and 183, and at early withdrawal visit. Samples were analyzed for fecal calprotectin concentrations using a validated, sensitive and specific ELISA method in compliance with the sponsor SOPs. A blood specimen for determination of hsCRP was obtained on Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, concentrations using a validated, sensitive and specific immunonephelometry method in compliance with the sponsor SOPs. Blood samples (6 mL) to provide approximately 3 mL serum were collected into appropriately labeled glass collection tubes (no additives) for the analysis of serum total sTL1A on Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 141, 169 and 183, and at early withdrawal visit. Samples were analyzed for serum total sTL1A concentrations using a validated, sensitive and specific high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method in compliance with the sponsor SOPs. Immunogenicity: Blood samples (3 mL) to provide approximately 1.2 mL serum for ADA and NAb analyses were collected into appropriately labeled tubes with no preservative (no anticoagulant or serum separator gel) on Days 1, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169 and 183, and at early withdrawal visit. A tiered ADA testing strategy was used: All samples that were positive were confirmed for antibody specificity. Confirmed positive samples were further characterized for titer and tested in the NAb assay, if bioanalytically feasible. Two (2) separate testing funnels were used for analysis of the samples for immunogenicity: 1. All the samples for immunogenicity were analyzed by the standard ADA assay for ADA detection, and the samples deemed positive by the standard ADA assay were subsequently analyzed by the plate-based NAb assay. 2. All the samples for immunogenicity were also analyzed by the new ADA assay with acid pre-treatment. The ADA positive samples characterized by the new ADA assay were further analyzed by the cell-based assay for the presence of NAb. Serum samples were analyzed for ADA with acid pre-treatment using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method and samples determined to be positive for ADA with acid pre-treatment were further characterized for NAb using cell-based assay method in compliance with the sponsor SOPs. Serum samples were analyzed for standard ADA assay using ECL method and samples determined to be positive for ADA by standard assay were further characterized for NAb using ELISA method in compliance with the sponsor SOPs. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included AE and serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring, safety laboratory tests, vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse rate, and temperature), and ECGs monitoring. Statistical Methods: This study employed Simon’s 2-stage design. Let p be the proportion of subjects achieving endoscopic improvement at Week 14 and the following hypotheses were tested in this study: H : p 6% versus H : p 41%, where 6% was the observed placebo endoscopic improvement 0 1 rate in anti-TNF experienced subjects from 2 tofacitinib Phase 3 induction studies in subjects with UC. A p-value of less than 0.05 corresponded to a statistically significant result; however, to establish a clinically significant result, it was required to have at least 9 out of 36 evaluable subjects achieving endoscopic improvement at Week 14 (ie, at least 25% of evaluable subjects achieving endoscopic improvement at Week 14) at the end of the second stage. If the actual number of evaluable subjects in the per protocol (PP) population was different from 36 at the end of the second stage, then it was required to have at least 25% subjects achieving endoscopic improvement at Week 14 for rejection of the null hypothesis H0 clinically. Efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint was used to assess the efficacy of PF-06480605 under Simon’s 2-stage design decision criteria. The primary analysis population was PP population, which consisted of subjects who were eligible for enrollment, not a major protocol violator, with at least 6 out of 7 planned doses received and a final colonoscopy at Week 14. The point estimate of endoscopic improvement rate, 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value were calculated according to the actual sample size in the PP population. The binary secondary efficacy endpoints, including remission and endoscopic remission at Week 14, were summarized by point estimates and appropriate CIs. These endpoints were analyzed separately for all treated population (consisting of subjects who had received at least 1 dose of PF-06480605) and PP population. Subjects who dropped out early from the study without a Week 14 colonoscopy were considered as failures in the all treated population analysis. Subgroup analyses for subjects who had prior use of conventional UC therapy (steroids, TNF inhibitors, immunosuppressants, or integrin inhibitors) were performed descriptively for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Pharmacokinetics: The PK concentration population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of PF-06480605 and in whom at least 1 concentration value was reported. The PK parameter population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of PF-06480605 and had at least 1 derived value of a specific PK parameter. PK concentrations were summarized and presented with summary statistics. Non-compartmental analysis was performed and the PK parameter estimates were provided. PK parameters were summarized by visit or dosing day and included the set of summary statistics. One (1) summary table presenting all PK parameters was provided. Pharmacodynamics: The PD biomarker analysis population was defined as all treated subjects who had at least 1 PD assessment. The PD endpoints were summarized by time and presented in a tabular or graphical form. Changes from baseline and absolute values of biomarker concentrations were reported. Immunogenicity: The immunogenicity assessment population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of PF-06480605 with at least 1 post-treatment ADA determination. Overall incidences of development of ADA and of NAb were reported along with relationships of incidence with respect to time. Both continuous endpoints and categorical endpoints (ie, positive and negative) were reported for the ADA and NAb assays by time points that samples were collected. Safety: The full analysis set (FAS) was defined as all treatment population which consisted of subjects who had received at least 1 dose of PF-06480605. This was the primary analysis population for the safety and treatment compliance. This population was also used to analyze efficacy endpoints in sensitivity analyses. The safety analysis set was the same as the FAS. This analysis set was the primary analysis population for treatment compliance and safety. Subjects who were not treated were excluded from the safety analyses. Safety data were presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate. All safety endpoints were listed and summarized in accordance with sponsor data standards. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: The study consisted of 2 parts, the induction period (treatment period) and the follow-up period. Fifty (50) subjects were assigned to and received the treatment with PF-06480605. Four (4) subjects discontinued from the treatment period: 3 subjects related to AEs and 1 subject related to lack of efficacy. All subjects moved into the follow-up period with the exception of 1 subject who discontinued treatment after 6 doses and chose not to go into the follow-up period due to an AE of colitis ulcerative. Forty-two (42) of 49 subjects completed the follow-up period of the study. Seven (7) subjects discontinued from study due to lack of efficacy (1), withdrawal by subject (4), and informed consent withdrawal (2). The majority of subjects were male (28 subjects, 56.0%) and White (48 subjects, 96.0%). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 40.0 (14.52) years, 70.06 (14.780) kg, and 23.60 (4.358) kg/m2, respectively. The most common forms of UC were pancolitis (24 subjects, 48.0%) and left-sided colitis (16 subjects, 32.0%). Seven (7 [14.0%]) and 3 (6.0%) subjects had proctosigmoiditis and extensive colitis, respectively. Most subjects had received steroid, anti-TNF inhibitors, anti-integrin inhibitors, and azathioprine for the treatment of UC at baseline (46 subjects [92.0%], 36 subjects [72.0%], 28 subjects [56.0%], and 33 subjects [66.0%], respectively). Efficacy Results: Primary Endpoint: The proportions of subjects achieving endoscopic improvement at Week 14 were 38.20% (95% CI: 23.82%, 53.68%) and 37.78% (95% CI: 23.77%, 53.46%) using uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) and maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) methods, respectively. The proportion of subjects achieving endoscopic improvement at Week 14 was statistically significant with the null hypothesis of 6% rejected (p-value <0.001) using UMVUE method. Subgroup Analysis of Primary Endpoint: Subjects without prior use of anti-TNF and anti-integrin inhibitors had greater observed proportion achieving endoscopic improvement at Week 14 (46.15% [95% CI: 19.22%, 74.87%] and 47.62% [95% CI: 25.71%, 70.22%], respectively) than those who had anti-TNF and anti-integrin inhibitors exposures (35.48% [95% CI: 19.23%, 54.63%] and 29.17% [95% CI: 12.62%, 51.09%], respectively). Secondary Endpoints Remission at Week 14: The proportions of subjects achieving remission at Week 14 (defined as a total Mayo score 2 with no individual subscore >1) were 24.00% (95% CI: 13.06%, 38.17%) and 26.67% (95% CI: 14.60%, 41.94%) in FAS and PP population, respectively, based on modified endoscopic subscore (in the modified definition, any presence of friability corresponded to an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3). Endoscopic Remission at Week 14: The proportion of subjects achieving endoscopic remission at Week 14 in FAS with non-responder imputation was 10.00% (95% CI: 3.33%, 21.81%). Similar results were found in FAS with last observation carry forward (LOCF) and in PP population with observed data (12.00% [95% CI: 4.53%, 24.31%] and 11.11% [95% CI: 3.71%, 24.05%], respectively). Subgroup Analysis of Secondary Endpoints: Based on modified endoscopic subscore, subjects without prior use of immunosuppressants, and anti-TNF and anti-integrin inhibitors had greater observed proportion achieving remission at Week 14 (36.36% [95% CI: 10.93%, 69.21%], 35.71% [95% CI: 12.76%, 64.86%], and 40.91% [95% CI: 20.71%, 63.65%], respectively) than those with prior use of immunosuppressants, and anti-TNF and anti-integrin inhibitors (21.05% [95% CI: 9.55%, 37.32%], 20.00% [95% CI [8.44%, 36.94%], and 11.11% [95% CI: 2.35%, 29.16%], respectively). Similarly, subjects without prior use of immunosuppressants and anti-TNF inhibitors had greater observed proportion achieving endoscopic remission at Week 14 in FAS with non-responder imputation (36.36% [95% CI: 10.93%, 69.21%] and 21.43% [95% CI: 4.66%, 50.80%], respectively) than those with prior use of immunosuppressants and anti-TNF inhibitors (2.63% [95% CI: 0.07%, 13.81%] and 5.71% [95% CI: 0.70%, 19.16%], respectively). Similar results were found in the analyses of FAS using LOCF for missing data imputation. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Results: Pharmacokinetics: Following multiple dose administration of 500 mg PF-06480605 intravenously Q2W for a total of 7 doses in subjects with moderate to severe UC, maximum serum concentration during the dosing interval (C ) values ranged between 99300 and max 1240000 ng/mL across all subjects dosed, with a geometric mean of 263400 ng/mL. After the achievement of C , PF-06480605 serum concentration exhibited a biphasic decline over max time with mean terminal half-life (t ) of 19.3 days. Geometric mean area under the ½ concentration-time profile from time 0 to time tau (τ), the dosing interval (AUC ) over a τ dosing interval of 14 days (336 hours) was 57610000 ng•hr/mL and geometric mean peak-to-trough ratio at steady state (PTR) was 3.0. Clearance (CL) geometric mean value was 0.00868 L/hr. Volume of distribution at steady state (V ) was low (geometric mean value of 4.69 L), indicating that PF-06480605 was ss primarily distributed in the plasma volume. Between-subject variability in PF-06480605 exposure on Day 85 was moderate to high with geometric percent coefficient of variation (%CV) was 45% for AUC and 54% for C . τ max Pharmacodynamics Fecal Calprotectin: The fecal calprotectin showed a significant reduction from baseline (51%-78%) following treatment with PF-06480605. The fecal calprotectin concentration decreased over time from Week 2 to Week 8, and the reduction was sustained through Week 26. hsCRP: The decrease from baseline in hsCRP concentration was observed with the treatment of PF-06480605. The hsCRP concentrations showed considerable decrease relative to baseline from Week 2 to Week 4, which was maintained through Week 26. Total sTL1A: The considerable increase from baseline in sTL1A profiles in UC subjects indicated evidence of sustained peripheral TL1A target engagement during treatment/induction period that was consistent with the intended action of PF-06480605. In the post-induction period, the sTL1A levels decreased slightly but were still higher as compared to baseline, which was suggestive of continued target engagement. Safety Results: A total of 33 subjects reported 109 all causality treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), of which 8 subjects experienced 18 treatment-related TEAEs. The majority of all causality TEAEs was mild or moderate in severity (76 and 28 of 109 events, respectively). Of the 18 treatment-related TEAEs, 12, 5, and 1 event was mild, moderate, and severe in severity, respectively. The most commonly reported all causality TEAEs were colitis ulcerative and arthralgia (6 subjects each, 12.0%), and abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, back pain, and alopecia (3 subjects each, 6%). No deaths, malignancies, or dose reductions or temporary discontinuations due to TEAEs occurred in this study. One (1) and 2 subjects discontinued from study and study treatment due to TEAEs, respectively. Three (3) subjects reported 4 treatment-emergent SAEs. Three (3) of these resulted from worsening of underlying disease activity and the fourth was a case of alopecia/baldness, which was reported as related to the study drug by the investigator as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), but unrelated by the sponsor. Two (2) subjects reported SAEs in the pre-randomization period. There were no clinically significant effects or trends observed for vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, or ECGs. Immunogenicity: Based on ADA assay with acid pre-treatment and cell-based NAb assay, the incidence of ADA in this study was 82% with titer values ranging from 1.31 to 4.42 and 1 value above the assay range (>4.64). Five (5) subjects (10%) tested NAb positive with relatively low titer values ranging from 0.809 to 1.38. Following PF-06480605 administration, the median time to first detection of ADA (with acid pre-treatment) and NAb (cell-based) were 140 and 114 days, respectively. Based on ADA assay with acid pre-treatment and cell-based NAb assay, there were no statistically significant effects of ADA and NAb status on the endoscopic improvement, remission (secondary endpoint), endoscopic remission, at Week 14; there was a small overall impact of ADA and NAb status on PK; and there appeared to be a trend of lower sTL1A target engagement starting from Week 8 for ADA and NAb positive subjects compared to the ADA and NAb negative subjects. Conclusions: Efficacy  The primary efficacy endpoint was met. The study showed statistically significant results in the primary endpoint with an endoscopic improvement rate of 38.2% (95% CI: 23.8%, 53.7%) at Week 14 in the PP population. The null hypothesis of 6% was rejected with a p-value<0.001. Similar CIs were found in FAS analysis.  The proportions of subjects achieving remission at Week 14 (defined as a total Mayo score 2 with no individual subscore >1) were 24.00% (95% CI: 13.06%, 38.17%) and 26.67% (95% CI: 14.60%, 41.94%) in FAS and PP population, respectively.  The proportion of subjects achieving endoscopic remission at Week 14 in FAS with non-responder imputation was 10.00% (95% CI: 3.33%, 21.81%). Safety  There were no deaths or malignancies. There were no dose reductions or temporary discontinuations due to TEAEs in this study. Of the 109 TEAEs, 18 treatment-related TEAEs were reported by 8 subjects: 12 TEAEs were mild, 5 TEAEs were moderate and 1 TEAE was severe. There were 4 treatment-emergent SAEs reported during the study. Three (3) of these resulted from worsening of underlying disease activity and the fourth was a case of alopecia/baldness, which was reported as related to the study drug by the investigator as an SUSAR but unrelated by the sponsor.  There were no clinically significant effects or trends observed for vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, or ECGs.  Of the 50 subjects enrolled into the treatment/induction period, 4 subjects discontinued treatment: 1 subject was related to an SAE (alopecia); 2 subjects discontinued due to non-serious AEs related to worsening UC; and the other subject discontinued due to lack of efficacy.  Of the 49 subjects who entered into the follow-up period of the study, 7 subjects discontinued from study. One (1) subject discontinued due to lack of efficacy, and 6 subjects withdrew from the study (2 withdrew their consent and 4 withdrew from the study as they did not want to further participate in the follow-up period of the study).  Based on ADA assay with acid pre-treatment and cell-based NAb assay, the incidences of ADA and NAb were 82% and 10%, respectively. The median time to first detection of ADA and NAb was 140 and 114 days, respectively, post first dose.  Based on ADA assay with acid pre-treatment and cell-based NAb assay, there were no statistically significant impacts of ADA and NAb status on endoscopic improvement, remission (secondary endpoint), endoscopic remission, . There was a small overall impact of ADA and NAb status on the PK. There appeared to be a trend of lower sTL1A target engagement starting from Week 8 for ADA and NAb positive subjects compared to the ADA and NAb negative subjects. However, the small sample size, high variability, and the high ADA incidence rates did not provide sufficient information to make definitive conclusion on the impact of ADA/NAb on the PK and efficacy.  Multiple intravenous infusion of PF-06480605 up to 7 doses was generally safe and well-tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe UC. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  Following multiple dose administration of 500 mg PF-06480605 intravenously Q2W for a total of 7 doses in subjects with moderate to severe UC, geometric mean Cmax and AUC values were 263400 ng/mL and 57610000 ng•hr/mL, respectively, with a τ geometric mean PTR of 3.0.  CL and V geometric mean values on Day 85 were 0.0087 L/hr and 4.69 L, ss respectively.  Mean t was 19.3 days. ½  Mean serum total sTL1A levels increased considerably from baseline following treatment with PF-06480605, indicating evidence of sustained peripheral target engagement during the treatment/induction period as well as in the post-induction period through Week 26.  With the treatment of PF-06480605, decreases from baseline in fecal calprotectin and hsCRP were observed through Week 26.
