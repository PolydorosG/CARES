Study Objectives and Endpoints Type Objective Endpoint PrimarySafety To evaluate the long-term safety and AE data (occurrence, nature, intensity, tolerability of pregabalin in pediatric and relationship to study medication). subjects 1 month through 16 years of age with POS and pediatric and adult Physical and neurological examinations. subjects 5 to 65 years of age with PGTC seizures. Vital signs. Growth and development parameters (height, weight, Tanner stage). Clinical laboratory data (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis). Electrocardiograms (ECGs). 28-day seizure rate (number of seizures per 28-day period). Assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior. Cognitive assessment battery (POS pediatric subjects 4 to 16 years of age only). METHODS Study Design: This was a 12 month, open-label, flexible dose, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pregabalin (administered twice daily [BID] in subjects 4 years of age and 3 times daily [TID] in subjects <4 years of age) as adjunctive therapy in pediatric subjects 1 month to 16 years of age with POS and pediatric and adult subjects 5 to 65 years of age with PGTC seizures. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Subjects who had participated in either Study A0081041 or Study A0081042, or direct enrolling subjects, who were 1 month to 16 years of age with diagnosis of epilepsy with seizures classified as simple partial, complex partial or partial becoming secondarily generalized, according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE 2010).  Subjects 5 to 65 years of age who participated in Study 1105 with a diagnosis of epilepsy (ILAE 2010) with PGTC seizures and who continued to satisfy seizure-related inclusion criteria for that study.  All subjects were to be receiving a stable dose of 1 to 3 AEDs at Visit 1. Study Treatment: Study medication was supplied by Pfizer as capsules of pregabalin (50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 225, and 300 mg), as well as 20 mg/mL solution (Table S2). The pregabalin liquid oral solution formulation was used for all subjects weighing <30 kg, while subjects weighing 30 kg used either the liquid oral solution or solid capsule formulation. Subjects 1 month to 16 years of age initiated dosing of pregabalin at the daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (subjects with body weight 30 kg) or 3.5 mg/kg/day (adjusted by 40% for subjects with body weight <30 kg) administered BID in subjects 4 years of age or TID in subjects <4 years of age or who previously participated in Study 1042 for a minimum of 1 week. Subjects 17 to 65 years of age who enrolled in this study following participation in Study 1105 initiated dosing of pregabalin at the level of 150 mg/day administered BID. Thereafter, dosing was flexible for all subjects based on individual seizure response and tolerability. Table S2.

Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Evaluations: There were no pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, or pharmacogenomic evaluations done in this study. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, growth and development parameters, clinical laboratory data, electrocardiograms (ECGs), seizure frequency, assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior, and cognitive testing (CogState Battery). Statistical Methods: The primary analysis set was the Safety Analysis Set (Safety study. Safety data (including AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, height/weight, physical/neurological examinations, suicidal ideation and behavior, and cognitive function) is summarized through standard data tabulations, descriptive statistics, and/or graphical presentations. Twenty-eight-day seizure rate was calculated from the seizure diaries as follows: # of seizures since last visit 28 day seizure rate = X 28 [# of days since last visit* - # of missing diary days since last visit] *Number of days since last visit is defined as: Date of last diary data entry since last visit – Date of first diary data entry since last visit +1. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Table S3. Subject Evaluation Groups – Safety Analysis Set Source: Table 14.1.1.1 Number of Subjects Analyzed for Adverse events is the number of subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and with at least one AE page. Number of Subjects Analyzed for Laboratory data is the number of subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and with at least one laboratory test during study treatment. The completion status is Study Completion, not Treatment Completion. Pregabalin - Pregabalin: any dose of pregabalin from the previous study and pregabalin in this study. Placebo - Pregabalin: placebo in the previous study, and pregabalin in this study. Direct Pregabalin: subjects with partial onset seizures who received pregabalin only in this study and did not participate in any previous study. Due to a China regulatory approval expiry at site (with a pending request for re-approval) data after Month 9 could not be submitted for 1 subject, who is reported as ongoing. Subject was reported as safe when leaving the study. Most subjects (491 [81.2%]) were 1 month to 16 years of age, with 114 (18.8%) subjects ≥17 years of age. The primary seizure type was POS for the majority (431 [71.2%]) of subjects, with 174 (28.8%) subjects with PGTC as the primary seizure type. More subjects were male (319) than female (286), and most subjects were white (463 [76.5%]) with 133 (22.0%) Asian subjects, 4 (0.7%) black subjects, and 5 (0.8%) subjects of other race. A total of 257 (42.5%) subjects previously participated in Study 1041, 163 (26.9%) subjects previously participated in Study 1042, 174 (28.8%) subjects previously participated in Study 1105, and 11 (1.8%) subjects directly enrolled into Study 1106. Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, Immunogenicity and/or Other Results: Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and/or other evaluations were not done. Safety Results: The overall median daily dose was 204.64 mg/day (range 21.9 mg/day to 562.7 mg/day). The median daily dose was lowest in the youngest subjects (1 month to <2 years of age, 115.60 mg/day), and was highest in subjects 10 to 16 years of age (308.90 mg/day). Table S4. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Causalities) - Safety Analysis Set Source: Table 14.3.1.2.1 a. One of these subjects died due to this event. Includes data up to 999 days after last dose of study drug. Except for the Number of Adverse Events subjects are counted only once per treatment in each row. Serious Adverse Events - according to the investigator’s assessment. Severity counts are based on the maximum severity or grade of events. All treated subjects are considered evaluable for adverse events. In the overall population, AEs reported in at least 10% of subjects were upper respiratory tract infection and pyrexia. Upper respiratory tract infection and pyrexia were the most frequently reported AEs (reported in at least 10% of subjects) in subjects 1 month to 16 years of age; the most frequently reported AEs (reported in at least 10% of subjects) in subjects ≥ 17 years of age were headache, dizziness, and somnolence. In total, 18 (3.0%) subjects discontinued due to AEs: 12 (2.4%) subjects 1 month to 16 years of age and 6 (5.3%) subjects ≥17 years of age. Seventeen of these subjects discontinued due to treatment-emergent AEs. The SOC with the most AEs leading to discontinuation was the nervous system disorders SOC (8 AEs for 8 subjects), of which the majority were due to a seizure- or epilepsy-related event. There were a total of 7 deaths; 6 deaths occurred during the study and 1 death occurred approximately 9 months after the subject had completed the study. No deaths were considered related to study drug by the investigator. SAEs were reported for 77 (12.7%) subjects. Pneumonia was the most frequently reported SAE, with 32 events during the study in 23 subjects. Several SAEs were seizure- or epilepsy-related. No subjects were permanently discontinued due to SAEs. Two subjects had SAEs of suicide attempt and were permanently discontinued from the study, one due to the outcome of an MHRA and one due to ongoing psychological and behavioral issues. One additional subject was discontinued from the study due to an AE of suicidal ideation. Pregabalin treatment resulted in an overall reduction in median 28-day seizure rate for POS and PGTC seizures. There were no clinically significant findings for laboratory results, physical and neurological examinations, cognitive function, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate), and ECGs. Conclusion(s): Long-term use of pregabalin in this study was generally safe and well tolerated and consistent with the well-established safety profile of pregabalin for patients with POS.
