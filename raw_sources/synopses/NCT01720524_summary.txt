Refer to Appendix 16.1.4.1 for a list of sites involved in this study. Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation Date: The first subject first visit was on 05 August 2013. Study Completion Date – Part A: End of enrollment: 31 December 2018. Report Date: 24 May 2019. Previous Report Date(s): Not applicable Phase of Development: Phase 3 Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: Table S1. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints (Part A) Assessed in a separate CSR for Part B of the study METHODS Study Design: This was a phase 3, multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, (sponsor/investigator and subject/legal acceptable representative), placebo-controlled, parallel group part of the study with a screening phase (up to 96 hours of age), treatment phase (≤14 days), and follow-up phase (up to 28±3 days). This study was conducted in subjects with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) or hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) and at risk for PPHN and had 2 consecutive parts (Part A and Part B). This study was conducted as part of a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) required by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A total number of 64 subjects were planned to be randomized to Part A. Because of the significant decline in enrollment despite all mitigation efforts, the EMA PDCO agreed to extend the duration of enrollment until 31 December 2018. Part A was concluded with 59 subjects randomized over a period of approximately 5 years. Part A: Neonates 96 hours of age (at randomization), at least 34 weeks gestational age, receiving inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) at 10 to 20 ppm while on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO )2 for PPHN or HRF and at risk for PPHN, with oxygenation index (OI) >15 and <60, were randomized to 1 of 2 parallel arms of study drug treatment: intravenous (IV) sildenafil or IV placebo (1:1 ratio). Efficacy and safety analysis of this double-blind phase of the study was performed after all subjects had completed or discontinued from the double-blind phase and the database for Part A of the study was locked. Part B: This part is a long-term, non-interventional follow-up, with visits at month 12 and 24, to assess developmental progress (neurology, ophthalmology and audiology assessments) of subjects who completed Part A. Analysis of this non-interventional phase of the study will be performed when all subjects have completed or discontinued from the 2 year follow-up visit. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects with PPHN, or HRF at risk for PPHN associated with idiopathic PPHN, meconium aspiration syndrome, sepsis, or pneumonia were enrolled in this study. Additional main inclusion criteria were: 96 hours of age at randomization (study drug must begin within 6 hours after randomization) and 34 weeks of gestation at screening, OI >15 and <60, calculated using 2 blood gases taken at least 30 minutes apart prior to randomization, and concurrent treatment with iNO at 10 to 20 ppm on 50% oxygen (O ).2 Study Treatment: Study drug was started within 6 hours after randomization. IV sildenafil group: IV sildenafil citrate was administered as a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg given over 30 minutes. This was followed by a maintenance treatment consisting of an IV infusion of 0.03 mg/kg/hr. Placebo group: IV 0.9% normal saline or dextrose 10% was administered at a rate similar to that used for the active investigational product infusion, based on subject’s weight, starting Study drug infusion had to continue for at least 48 hours, for up to 14 days, with or without the administration of additional therapy for PPHN, such as alternative pulmonary vasodilator. Note: The study drug infusion could be stopped before 48 hours, at the Principal Investigator’s discretion. Table S2.

The primary efficacy analysis was conducted using the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population. For the co-primary endpoints, the analyses were also conducted using the Per-Protocol (PP) population as sensitivity analyses. Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are included in Table S1. CCI Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Evaluations: Pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints included assessments of sildenafil and its major metabolite UK-103,320 plasma concentrations and the corresponding PK parameters obtained from a population PK analysis. The plasma concentration listings with subject identification (ID) and sampling time relative to sildenafil dosing time were reported in this Clinical Study Report (CSR). PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters and the relationships with the endpoints of interests will be explored; the results will be reported separately from the CSR. Safety Evaluations: Safety analyses were carried out for the safety analysis set for the Part A of the study. Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring, physical examinations, vital signs measurements, AEs monitoring, serious AEs (SAEs) monitoring, and safety laboratory tests (Table S1). Statistical Methods: The primary analysis was to test for the superiority of iNO + sildenafil over iNO + placebo for time on iNO treatment after initiation of IV study drug treatment for subjects without treatment failures and for treatment failure rate. For the primary efficacy analyses, time on iNO for subjects without treatment failures was summarized for each treatment. If multiple iNO treatments were given to a subject, total time on iNO was calculated for this endpoint for that subject. If there were gaps in between consecutive iNO treatments, those gaps were included in the calculation of total time on iNO. Treatment comparison was conducted using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for time on iNO treatment prior to randomization. Mean treatment difference, its 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value were calculated. Treatment failure rate and its 95% CI were calculated for each treatment group. Treatment comparison was conducted using either Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test whichever was appropriate. Estimated treatment difference in rates, its 95% CI and p-value were calculated. If p-values were <0.05(2-sided) from both analyses in favor of iNO + sildenafil treatment, superiority of iNO + sildenafil over iNO + placebo could be concluded at 5% (2-sided) significance level. For secondary analyses of continuous endpoints CCI similar analyses (ie, ANCOVA) conducted for time on iNO or 2-sample t-test (no adjustment for baseline values) were used. For categorical endpoints, similar analyses conducted for treatment failure rate were used. For time-to-event endpoints, time-to-results were summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank test was used for treatment comparisons. CCI Safety analyses were carried out for the safety analysis set of the study. All AEs were coded and grouped by system organ class (SOC). The incidence of each treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was tabulated by treatment. Tabulations by maximum severity and relationship to study drug were also included. AE data were summarized by treatment and in accordance with the current Pfizer data standards. For AEs, for tier-11 and tier-22 AEs, similar analyses conducted for treatment failure rate were used. No p-values were calculated for tier-2 events. For summary tables, footnotes 1 Tier-1 events: These are pre specified events of clinical importance and are maintained in a list in the product’s Safety Review Plan, and they are: Vision disorders (by high-level group term), hearing losses (by high-level term), erection increased (by preferred term). 2 Tier-2 events: These are events that are not tier 1 and are not uncommon in this patient population, in any were added stating p-values and CIs were not adjusted for multiplicity and should be used for screening purpose only. Laboratory data were summarized by treatment and in accordance with the current Pfizer data standards. Safety laboratory data were explored through the use of standard presentations of descriptive statistics. The following safety data were summarized by treatment and in accordance with the current Pfizer data standards: vital signs, demographics, subject disposition, study duration, and concomitant data medication. All other safety assessments were also described using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Numbers of screened, treated, completed, discontinued, and analyzed subjects, and number of subjects assigned to each treatment group are provided in Table S3. Thirty-three (33) male and 26 female subjects were included in the study. Most subjects were white (65.5% in the IV sildenafil group and 53.3% in the placebo group). The median age was 39.50 hours in the sildenafil group and 45.90 hours in the placebo group. The median birth weight was 3.25 kg (range: 2.2-5.4 kg) in the IV sildenafil group and 3.35 kg (range: 2.1-4.9 kg) in the placebo group. The proportions of gender, age, ethnicity and birth weight were similar between IV sildenafil group and placebo group. In the placebo group the percentage of Black and Asian subjects (23.3% and 16.7%, respectively) were higher than in the IV sildenafil group (3.4% and 6.9%, respectively). The most common primary diagnosis by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term was PPHN in 20 and 18 subjects of the IV sildenafil group and placebo group, respectively. The median duration since onset was 2.00 days (range: 1.00-5.00 days). The most predisposing condition by MedDRA preferred term was meconium aspiration syndrome in 14 and 15 subjects of the IV sildenafil group and placebo group, respectively. The median duration since onset was 2.00 days (range: 1.00-4.00 days). Concomitant medications were similar between the treatment groups. The most common concomitant medications (excluding background therapy of nitric oxide) were morphine (18 and 22 subjects), midazolam (21 and 18 subjects), and dopamine (18 and 19 subjects) in the IV sildenafil and placebo group, respectively. The study was completed by 23 (79.3%) subjects in the IV sildenafil group and by 23 (76.7%) subjects in the placebo group. Treatment was discontinued by 6 (20.7%) subjects Table S3.

Efficacy Results: Co-primary endpoints: The treatment failure rate was 27.6% and 20.0% in the IV sildenafil group and placebo group, respectively. The treatment difference was not statistically significant. The estimated treatment difference (95% CI) between IV sildenafil group and placebo group was 7.6% (-14.1%, 29.3%) with a p-value of 0.4935. The results for the PP population were similar to those in the ITT population; the estimated treatment difference (95% CI) between IV sildenafil group and placebo group was 8.6% (-14.4%, 31.5%) with a p-value of 0.4691. The number (%) of subjects with each first qualifying event for treatment failure was similar between the treatment groups. The first events of treatment failures in the IV sildenafil group were additional PPHN therapy for 4 (13.8%) subjects, ECMO therapy for 3 (10.3%) subjects and death for 1 (3.4%) subject. The first events of treatment failures in the placebo group were additional PPHN therapy and ECMO therapy for 3 (10.0%) subjects each (Table S4). Table S4.

All these subjects were on iNO treatment prior to initiation of study drug with a median time of 1.1 days (range: 0.1-2.5 days) in the IV sildenafil group and 0.9 days (range: 0.2-2.4 days) in the placebo group. The median time on iNO treatment after initiation of IV study drug was similar in both the IV sildenafil group and the placebo group with 3.2 days (range: 0.5-13.2 days) and 3.0 days (range: 0.8-14.0 days), respectively. The least square (LS) mean days of time on iNO treatment after initiation of IV study drug were the same at about 4.1 days for the 2 treatment groups. The LS mean difference (95% CI) for IV sildenafil group versus placebo group was 0.0 days (-2.08, 2.04) with a 2-sided p-value of 0.9850. The results for the PP population were similar to those for the ITT population; the LS mean difference (95% CI) for IV sildenafil group versus placebo group was 0.3 days (-2.58, 1.94) with a 2-sided p-value of 0.7765 (Table S5).

Secondary endpoints: All subjects in both treatment groups received mechanical ventilation. The median time to final weaning based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates (95% CI) was 8.3 days (5.46, 11.75 days) in the IV sildenafil group and 7.3 days (5.46, 10.78 days) in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with the p-value from log-rank test of 0.9885 (2-sided). As the treatment failure rate was 27.6% for the IV sildenafil group and 20% for the placebo group, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of median time from initiation of IV study drug to treatment failure could not be calculated. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups for time from initiation of IV study drug to treatment failure with the p-value from the log-rank test of 0.4910. For subjects with treatment failure, the median time from initiation of IV study drug to first treatment failure was 1.2 days (range: 0.0-7.0 days) in the IV sildenafil group and 1.5 days (range: 0.7-11.0 days) in the placebo For treatment comparisons in oxygenation parameters (OI , PaO /FiO ratio, and differential 2 2 saturation), the mean changes observed at 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours post study drug initiation were not statistically significant. For both treatment groups, a mean reduction for OI was observed at 1 hour after study drug initiation and reached a maximum at 24 hours post study drug initiation. At 24 hours post study drug initiation, the mean OI change from baseline was similar between the 2 treatment groups with mean change (95% CI) of -11.3 (-17.1, -5.4) for the IV sildenafil group and -9.8 (-15.5, -4.1) for the placebo group. CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI CCI Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Results: PK/PD modeling results will be reported in a separate population PK analysis report. Safety Results: TEAEs of all causalities, serious TEAEs, severe TEAEs and discontinuations due to AEs were reported in the IV sildenafil group in 22 (75.9%) subjects, 7 (24.1%) subjects, 9 (31.0%) subjects, and 4 (13.8%) subjects, respectively. TEAEs of all causalities, serious TEAEs, severe TEAEs and discontinuations due to AEs were reported in the placebo group in 19 (63.3%) subjects, 2 (6.7%) subjects, 7 (23.3%) subjects), and 4 (13.3%) subjects, respectively. One subject each in both treatment groups had a dose reduction or temporary discontinuation due to AEs (Table S6). In the IV sildenafil group, the most common TEAEs of all causalities by preferred term were hypotension (8 [27.6%] subjects), hypokalaemia (7 [24.1%] subjects), anaemia and drug withdrawal syndrome (4 [13.8%] subjects each), and bradycardia (3 [10.3%] subjects). In the placebo group, the most common TEAEs by preferred term were pneumothorax (4 [13.3%] subjects), anaemia, oedema, hyperbilirubinaemia, C-reactive protein increased, and hypotension (3 [10.0%] subjects each). Most of the TEAEs in both treatment groups were of mild intensity. Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 9 (31.0%) subjects in the IV sildenafil group and in 4 (13.3%) subjects in the placebo group. A treatment-related SAE was reported for 1 (3.4%) subject and severe treatment-related AEs were reported for 2 (6.9%) subjects in the IV sildenafil group; no treatment-related SAEs and severe treatment-related AEs were reported for the placebo group. One subject each in both treatment groups discontinued due to treatment-related AEs. One subject in the IV sildenafil group had a dose reduction or temporary discontinuation due to treatment-related AEs (Table S6). In the IV sildenafil group, the most common treatment-related TEAE by preferred term was hypotension (6 [20.7%] subjects). In the placebo group, TEAEs reported by preferred term were anaemia, underdose, hyperchloraemia, hypernatraemia, hypoglycaemia and rash erythematous which occurred in 1 (3.3%) subject each. Most of the TEAEs were of mild intensity; 2 TEAEs of hypotension in the IV sildenafil group were of severe intensity. The incidence of all causalities TEAE of hypotension was higher in the IV sildenafil group compared to the placebo group (8 [27.6%] out of 29 subjects versus 3 [10.0%] out of 30 subjects). The TEAE of hypotension occurred during the first 24 hours of study treatment for all the 8 subjects in the IV sildenafil group and 1 out of 3 subjects in the placebo group. One(1) subject in the placebo group experienced a TEAE of hypotension during the loading 6 subjects had TEAEs of hypotension with severity of mild or moderate, and 2 with severity of severe. Among the 3 subjects in the placebo group, the TEAEs of hypotension were either moderate or severe. No subjects met the reporting criteria of tier-1 AEs. TEAEs of Tier-2 events were reported for some subjects in the study, and the 95% CIs for all risk differences include 0. Three (3) deaths were reported during the study, 2 subjects died in the IV sildenafil group and 1 subject died in the placebo group. Both subjects in the IV sildenafil group died during the active treatment period while the subject in the placebo group died 16 days after discontinuation from study drug treatment due to insufficient clinical response. None of the deaths was assessed by the investigator to be related to treatment. Over the study duration, treatment-emergent SAEs of all causalities were reported in 7 (24.1%) subjects in the IV sildenafil group and in 2 (6.7%) subjects in the placebo group. Of these, a treatment-related SAE was reported in 1 (3.4%) subject in the IV sildenafil group (SAE of hypotension, leading to permanent discontinuation from study drug treatment); no treatment related SAEs were reported in the placebo group (Table S6). AEs leading to permanent discontinuations from study treatment were reported for 8 subjects, the incidence was comparable between the treatment groups with 4 (13.8%) in the IV sildenafil group and 4 (13.3%) in the placebo group (Table S6). For the IV sildenafil group, the AEs leading to permanent discontinuation from study treatment included respiratory failure, persistent foetal circulation, and hypoxia, which were not treatment-related, and hypotension which was treatment-related. For the placebo group, the AEs leading to permanent discontinuation from study treatment included disease progression and respiratory failure which were not treatment-related, and rash erythematous which was treatment-related.

Changes from baseline with regards to vital signs were assessed not to be clinically significant. Conclusion(s):  The study did not demonstrate superior efficacy of IV sildenafil when added to iNO comparing to iNO alone for the treatment of neonates with PPHN or hypoxic respiratory failure and at risk for PPHN.  There was an observed numerical imbalance in AEs and SAEs between the treatment groups. Review of events reported did not identify any cluster or pattern of events indicative of a safety concern with the use of sildenafil.
