METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 2a, randomized, double blind, vehicle controlled, parallel group, multicenter study on the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of PF-07038124 0.01% once daily (QD) versus vehicle control in the treatment of adult participants with mild to moderate AD or mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. In this study the efficacy of PF-07038124 ointment versus vehicle was assessed in 2 different indications – there was a separate vehicle 17 weeks, including a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period of 6 weeks, and a safety follow-up period of 4-5 weeks from last dose of study drug to last study visit. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Male or female participants with AD diagnosis at least 3 months prior to Day 1 or with a diagnosis of plague psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) for at least 6 months prior to Day 1 between the ages of 18 and 70 years, inclusive, at Visit 1 (Screening Visit/time of informed consent). Study Treatment: Study treatment in this study refers to 0.01% weight/weight (wt/wt) ointment of PF-07038124 and PF-07038124 vehicle ointment (placebo) supplied in 60 g tubes. A thin layer of study treatment ointment (approximately 3 mg/cm2) was applied QD (around the same time of the day) beginning on Day 1 through the final dose at the Week 6 visit. All subsequent doses after the first dose on Day 1, except the dose on the days of in-clinic visits, were applied at home. The study treatment information is provided in Table S3. Table S3. Investigational Product Description Investigational Product Vendor Lot No. Pfizer Lot No. Strength/Potency Dosage Form Description Placebo for K200714A 20-003423 0 mg/g Ointment PF-07038124 Topical Ointment in 60 g Tube) PF-07038124 0.1 mg/g K200721A 20-003576 0.1 mg/g Ointment Topical Ointment in 60 g Tube Efficacy Evaluations: AD Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Percent change from baseline in EASI total score at Week 6. The EASI quantifies the severity of a participant’s AD based on both severity of lesion by clinical signs and the percent of BSA affected. The percentage surface area affected was estimated by means of the “handprint method”, where the full hand of the participant (ie, the participant’s fully extended palm, fingers and thumb together) represented approximately 1% of the total BSA. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Proportion of participants achieving IGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) (on a 5-point scale) and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 6. IGA score reflects a global consideration of the erythema, induration and scaling. Other Secondary Efficacy: Proportion of participants having ≥4 points of reduction in weekly averages of PP-NRS from baseline at study visit time points specified in Table S1. The numerical rating scale, ranging from 0 (‘No Itch) to 10 (‘Worst Itch Imaginable’) with a 24-hour recall period. PP-NRS was assessed daily during the 7 days immediately preceding randomization and a minimum of 4 daily scores out of the 7 days prior to Day 1 was required to calculate the baseline average score. Plaque Psoriasis Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change from baseline in PSAI score at Week 6. PASI quantifies the severity of a participant’s psoriasis based on both lesion severity and the percentage of body surface area affected. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: Proportion of participants with PGA score clear (0) or almost clear (1) (on a 5-point scale) and ≥2 points improvement from baseline at Week 6. The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a descriptive 5-point scale: 0, “clear”; 1, “almost clear”; 2, “mild”; 3, “moderate”; 4 “severe”. Other Secondary Efficacy: Proportion of participants who achieved a PSI score of 0 (not at all) or 1 (mild) on every item at study visit time points specified in Table S2. PSI is a self-administered 8 item questionnaire that measures the severity of psoriasis symptoms over the past 24 hours and the past 7 days. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included physical examinations, vital signs (temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure), 12-lead ECGs, AEs, safety laboratory tests and skin tolerability. Statistical Methods: For the main analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (EASI and PASI), percent change from baseline was analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with the observed (or imputed) Week 6 change from baseline score as the dependent variable with treatment arm and baseline score at the independent variables. The least-square mean (LSM), the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the LSM, the difference between the LSM for each pair of treatment groups, and the corresponding 90% CI were presented. To assess the impact of baseline distribution the main analysis was repeated with an ANOVA model (excluding baseline as a covariate). For the main analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints (IGA/PGA response at Week 6), risk differences were analyzed using the method of Chan and Zhang (1999). CI of binomial proportion was reported using the Blyth-Still-Casella method. Proportions, risk differences and 90% CI are presented. PK concentrations were summarized and presented with descriptive statistics. All safety data were summarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulations, descriptive statistics, categorical summaries, and graphical presentations. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 152 participants were screened to obtain 104 randomized participants (70 for AD group and 34 for plaque psoriasis group). All participants received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants disposition events are summarized in Table S4. The mean age of participants with AD was 41.4 years in PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group and 36.1 years in vehicle group. The mean age of participants with plaque psoriasis was 51.8 years in PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group and 51.2 years in vehicle group. Refer to Table S5 for other demographic characteristics and physical measurements at baseline.

Figure S13. Plot of Proportion of Participants Achieving Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) Score 0 or 1 on Every Item - Exact Method, FAS (NRI) (Protocol C3941002) Safety Results: There were no deaths or SAEs in the study. Treatment-related severe AEs (4 participants) all occurred in the vehicle group. There were no treatment-related AEs in the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group. The number of TEAEs (all-causality) and participants reporting TEAEs were higher in the vehicle group (15 [29.4%] participants with 26 events) compared to the PF-07038124 group (12 [22.6%] participants with 16 events). No participants discontinued from study due to AE. There were 3 (5.9%) participants in the vehicle group with 3 TEAEs related to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), and 1 (2.0%) participant had a temporary discontinuation due to COVID-19. No participants in the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) groups experienced AE related to COVID-19. The most common all-causality TEAEs by system organ class (SOC) in the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group was Infections and Infestations (11.3%), and in vehicle group was Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (13.7%). There were no participants with application site pain or other skin reaction at application site in the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) groups. The number of participants with abnormal laboratory results were comparable between the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) and vehicle groups. There were no clinically significant trends in platelet, lymphocyte, neutrophil counts, creatinine or hemoglobin, bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and creatine kinase (CK) levels. No laboratory values were considered to be clinically significant in this study. There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline and no observed trends in ECGs, vital signs, or safety labs in either the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) or the vehicle groups. A majority of the participants had no skin tolerability issues (Grade = 0) after study treatment application. Most cases of skin tolerability issues were mild (Grade = 1), with the numbers about twice as likely to be reported in the vehicle group vs. the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group (16 vs. 10 occurrences of mild skin tolerability issues, and 11 vs. 4 occurrences of moderate skin tolerability issues [Grade = 2]). All severe skin tolerability issues (Grade = 3) to study treatment application resulting in discontinuation from study treatment (in 2 participants) occurred in the vehicle group. There were no participants with application site pain or other skin reactions at application site in the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group. Conclusion(s): Efficacy The study met the statistical significance for the primary endpoint for both indications. AD:  PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) met the primary efficacy endpoint in the C3941002 study for AD: PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) was statistically significantly different from vehicle in percentage change from baseline in EASI score at Week 6.  There was statistically significant difference in key secondary endpoint: response rate for IGA (clear - 0 or almost clear - 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 points) at Week 6 between PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group and vehicle group, which supported the findings of primary endpoint analysis.  The results from other important secondary endpoints including EASI-75 and PP-NRS response at Week 6 were consistent with the primary and key secondary endpoint findings. Plaque Psoriasis:  PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) met the primary efficacy endpoint in the C3941002 study for Plaque Psoriasis: PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) was statistically significantly different from vehicle in change from baseline in PASI score at Week 6.  There was no statistically significant difference in key secondary endpoint: response rate for PGA (clear - 0 or almost clear - 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 points) at Week 6 between PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group and vehicle group, although observed response rate was higher in PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group than vehicle group.  The results from PASI-75 at Week 6 were consistent with the primary findings. Safety  PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) was overall safe and well tolerated in both AD and plaque psoriasis populations.  There were no deaths or SAEs in the study. Severe AEs (in 4 participants) and severe skin tolerability to study treatment application (in 2 participants) all occurred in the vehicle group.  The number of TEAEs (all-causality) and participants reporting TEAEs were higher in the vehicle group compared to the PF-07038124 group. There were no treatment related AEs in PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group.  The most common SOC for AEs in PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group was Infections and Infestations.  There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline and no observed trends in ECGs, vital signs, or safety labs in either the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) or the vehicle groups.  A majority of the participants had no skin tolerability issues after study treatment application. Most cases of skin tolerability issues were mild, with the numbers about twice as likely to be reported in the vehicle group vs. the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group. All severe skin tolerability issues to study treatment application resulting in discontinuation from study treatment (in 2 participants) occurred in the vehicle group. There were no participants with application site pain or other skin reactions at application site in the PF-07038124 (0.01% ointment QD) group.
