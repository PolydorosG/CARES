METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1, open-label, 3-treatment, 6-sequence, 3-period crossover study to estimate the effect of steady state PF-07321332/ritonavir on the PK of midazolam in healthy adult participants. The study consisted of 3 treatments: single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg alone (Treatment A), multiple oral doses of PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg in combination with a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg (Treatment B), and multiple oral doses of ritonavir 100 mg in combination with a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg (Treatment C). Six treatment sequences were included with each participant receiving all Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Participants of 18 to 60 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent document (ICD); Participants were overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation; Participants who were willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures; Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test; Participants had body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2 and a total body weight 50 kg (110 lb). Study Treatment: Treatment A: Single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg. Treatment B: PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg administered orally, every 12 hours (q12h) for 9 doses: Day 1 morning to Day 5 morning. On Day 5, participants received a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg administered with the Day 5 morning dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir.

Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Blood samples were collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of midazolam, PF-07321332 and ritonavir. Plasma samples were analyzed using validated analytical methods in compliance with applicable standard operating procedures (SOPs). The following plasma midazolam, PF-07321332, and ritonavir PK parameters (Table S3) were calculated for each participant and treatment using non-compartmental analysis of plasma concentration-time data. Samples below the lower limit of quantitation were set to 0 (0 ng/mL), and actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis. Table S3.

Statistical Methods: PK Analysis The interactive effect on PK parameters was determined by constructing 90% confidence intervals (CIs) around the estimated difference between the Test and Reference treatments using a mixed effects model based on natural log transformed data. The mixed effects model was implemented using statistical analysis software (SAS) Proc Mixed, with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation method and Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom algorithm. Safety Analysis A set of summary tables split by treatment was produced to evaluate any potential risk associated with the safety and toleration of administering single dose midazolam without or following administration with multiple doses of PF-07321332/ritonavir or ritonavir. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 12 participants were assigned to treatments. A total of 10 participants completed treatments assigned in 6 sequences as planned, with 2 participants (1 participant in PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg=>ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg=>midazolam 2 mg sequence, 1 participant in ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg=>PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg=>midazolam 2 mg sequence) discontinued from the study due to AEs. A total of 11 male participants and 1 female participant were assigned to the study interventions. Most of the participants were White (9/12, 75%) and not Hispanic or Latino (10/12, 83.3%). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 34.6 (9.26) years, ranging from 21 to 50 years. The overall mean (SD) weight and BMI were 70.450 (8.7187) kg and 23.34 (1.710) kg/m2, respectively. Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done for this study. Pharmacokinetic Results: Midazolam Pharmacokinetics: Following a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg administered alone and with multiple doses of PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg or ritonavir 100 mg, plasma concentrations for midazolam were markedly higher following co-administration compared to administration alone. Midazolam C were observed in a median T of 1.0 hours post dose across all treatments. max max Midazolam plasma exposure based on geometric mean AUC increased more than 12-fold inf with a nearly 4-fold increase for C following co-administration with multiple oral doses of max PF-07321332/ritonavir combination or ritonavir. Co-administration of midazolam with PF-07321332/ritonavir did not result in any further increases in midazolam exposure compared to co-administration of midazolam with ritonavir. The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% CIs) for midazolam AUCinf and C were 1430.02% (1204.54%, 1697.71%) and 368.33% (318.91%, 425.41%) max respectively, following midazolam administration with multiple doses of PF-07321332/ritonavir combination (Test) as compared to administration alone (Reference), The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% CIs) for midazolam AUCinf and C were 1645.15% (1385.75%, 1953.11%) and 387.20% (335.25%, 447.21%) max respectively, following midazolam administration with multiple doses of ritonavir (Test) as compared to administration alone (Reference), Table S5. Mean t values for midazolam administered alone were 4.99 hours compared to 10.47 hours ½ and 11.54 hours following co-administration with multiple doses of PF-07321332/ritonavir, and with ritonavir, respectively. CL/F for midazolam was greatly reduced following co-administration with multiple doses of PF-07321332/ritonavir and ritonavir compared to midazolam administered alone. Geometric mean CL/F values were 76.57 L/hr for midazolam administered alone, compared to 5.50 L/hr and 4.78 L/hr following co-administration with PF-07321332/ritonavir, and with ritonavir, respectively, Table S4. Safety Results: The term “AE” refers to “TEAE” in this synopsis. AE monitoring: A total of 8, 19 and 14 all-causality AEs were reported by 4 (40%), 9 (81.8%), and 7 (63.6%) participants, who received midazolam 2 mg, PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg, respectively. Among all-causality AEs, 7, 16, and 13 AEs were considered treatment related, reported by 4 (40%), 9 (81.8%), and 7 (63.6%) participants, who received midazolam 2 mg, PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg, respectively. Two participants (1 [9.1%] participant who received PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg, and 1 [9.1%] participant who received ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg) were discontinued from the study due to AEs. Most of the AEs were mild in severity. A total of 3 TEAEs with moderate severity were reported. No deaths, severe AEs or SAEs, dose reductions or temporary discontinuations were reported. Clinical safety laboratory assessments: Laboratory test abnormalities were reported in 5 (50%), 5 (45.5%), and 8 (72.7%) participants who received midazolam 2 mg, PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg, respectively. None of the laboratory abnormalities were considered as clinically significant by the investigator. Vital signs: One (9.1%) participant who received PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg + midazolam 2 mg was initially reported to have a supine systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg which was not considered as clinically significant. ECG assessments: No participants had ECG values meeting pre-defined reporting criteria. Conclusion(s):  PK of midazolam was comparable between midazolam + PF-07321332/ritonavir (Treatment B) and midazolam + ritonavir (Treatment C) treatment group.  Co-administration of multiple oral dose PF-07321332/ritonavir increased single dose midazolam exposure (AUC and C ). The test/reference ratios of the adjusted inf max geometric means (90% CIs) for midazolam AUC and C were 1430.02 % inf max (1204.54%, 1697.71%) and 368.33% (318.91%, 425.41%), respectively, when midazolam was co-administered with PF-07321332/ritonavir (Test) compared to midazolam administered alone (Reference).  Co-administration of multiple oral dose ritonavir increased single dose midazolam exposure (AUC and C ). The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means inf max (90% CIs) for midazolam AUC and C were 1645.15 % (1385.75%, 1953.11%) inf max and 387.20% (335.25%, 447.21%), respectively, when midazolam was co-administered with ritonavir (Test) compared to midazolam administered alone (Reference).  Study interventions were generally safe and well tolerated for participants administered PF-07321332/ritonavir in the presence of midazolam.
