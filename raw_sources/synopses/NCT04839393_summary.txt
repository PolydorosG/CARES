Table S3. Treatment Scheme for Part A *Each participant was planned to undergo 2 treatment periods with a washout interval between periods of at Table S4. Treatment Scheme for Part B In Part A and Part B morning doses, study interventions were administered with breakfast at approximately 0800 hours (plus or minus 2 hours). For BID dosing on Day 46, Day 47, and Day 61, evening dosing of PF-06865571 and/or PF-06882961 occurred approximately 12 hours after morning dosing. On all other study days, evening dosing of PF-06865571 and/or PF-06882961 occurred approximately 10 hours after morning dosing. Efficacy Evaluations: Not Applicable. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Blood samples were collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of PF-06882961 and PF-06865571, and were analyzed using validated analytical methods in compliance with applicable standard operating procedures (SOPs). The plasma PK parameters were calculated for each participant for each treatment, as applicable, using non-compartmental analysis of plasma concentration-time data. Samples below the lower limit of quantitation were set to zero (0 ng/mL) for analysis. Actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse event (AE) monitoring, physical examinations (PEs), vital signs measurements, ECGs assessments, clinical safety laboratory assessments, suicidal ideation and behavior risk monitoring, coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) specific assessments, pregnancy testing, management of hypoglycemia and glucometer monitoring of glucose. Statistical Methods: PK Plasma concentrations were listed and summarized descriptively by PK sampling time and treatment (dosing alone versus co-administration). Individual participant and median and statistics and median and mean plots by sampling time, the nominal PK sampling time was used, for individual participant plots by time, the actual PK sampling time was used for plasma samples. Median and mean profiles were presented on both linear and semi-log scales. Natural log-transformed PK parameters data were analyzed using a mixed effect model with treatment, sequence, and period as a fixed effects and participant embedded in sequence as a random effect. Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (Test-Reference) and corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from the models. The adjusted mean differences and 90% CIs for the differences were exponentiated to provide estimates of the ratio of adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) and 90% CIs for the ratios. Safety AEs, ECGs, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR), and safety laboratory data were reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study to evaluate the safety of participants. Any clinical laboratory, ECG, BP, and PR abnormalities of potential clinical concern were described. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 8 participants were assigned to the Part A of the study and all completed the open-label treatment and follow-up phases.

AUC (ng.hr/mL) 6660 9011 73.91 (67.95, 80.40) Safety Results: TEAEs: No TEAEs were reported during Part A of the study. In Part B, a total 18 (94.7%) participants were reported with 89 all-causality AEs, 84 of which were considered as treatment-related.  Most frequently occurred (reported by over 50% of the participants) all-causality AEs were nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite, all of which were considered treatment-related. Notably, these events were mostly reported when participants received treatment of PF-06882961 titration up to 200 mg BID, during which 12 (63.2%), 7 (36.8%), and 10 (52.5%) participants reported nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite, respectively.  Most TEAEs reported were mild in severity, except 1 moderate AE of nausea was reported by 1 participant during treatment of PF-06882961 titration up to 200 mg BID.  Overall, all-causality AEs under system organ class (SOC) of Gastrointestinal Disorders, Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders, and Nervous System Disorders were mostly commonly reported.  A total of 2 participants had dose reductions during the study: o One participant had a PF-06882961 dose reduction from 180 mg BID to 160 mg BID from Day 42 through the end of study treatment due to AEs of constipation (mild) and nausea (mild), both were treatment-related. o One participant had a PF-06882961 dose reduction from 200 mg BID to 180 mg BID at the second dose on Day 59 and further reduced from 180 mg BID to 160 mg BID from Day 60 through the end of study treatment due to AEs of nausea (moderate), vomiting (mild) and dizziness (mild), all were treatment-related.  No deaths, severe AEs or serious adverse events (SAEs), or temporary discontinuations were reported.  A total of 2 participants discontinued from study due to the same reason: AE of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test positive, both occurred during PF-06882961 titration up to 200 mg BID. Both AEs were mild and assessed as not related to the study intervention. Hypoglycemic Adverse Events: One (5.3%) participant reported symptomatic hypoglycemia during titration of PF-06882961 up to 200 mg BID. An AE of hypoglycaemia (investigator term: hypoglycemic event) with mild severity was reported and assessed as treatment-related. No actions regarding study intervention or concomitant medication were taken, while oral carbohydrate was given in response to the AE. Clinical Laboratory Evaluation: In Part A, laboratory test abnormalities were reported in 2 (25%) and 3 (37.5%) participants during treatment of PF-06882961 20 mg, and PF-06882961 20 mg + PF-06865571 300 mg, respectively.
