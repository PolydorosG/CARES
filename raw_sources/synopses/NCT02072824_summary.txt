PROPRIETARY DRUG NAME®/GENERIC DRUG NAME: Lyrica/Pregabalin PROTOCOL NO.: A0081042 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multicenter Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Pregabalin as Adjunctive Therapy in Children 1 Month Through <4 Years of Age With Partial Onset Seizures Study Center(s): Subjects were randomized at 52 centers in 22 countries: Belarus (1), Belgium (1), Bulgaria (2), China (2), France (1), Germany (1), Greece (1), Hungary (6), Israel (1), Lebanon (2), Malaysia (1), Philippines (7), Republic of Korea (1), Romania (2), Russian Federation (6), Serbia (2), Spain (1), Taiwan (3), Thailand (2), Turkey (1), Ukraine (5), and the US (3). Study Initiation Date and Final Completion Date: Study Initiation Date: 16 September 2014 Final Completion Date: 13 March 2018 Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objective(s): The primary objective of the study was:  To evaluate the efficacy of 2 dose levels of pregabalin compared to placebo as an adjunctive treatment in reducing the frequency of partial onset seizures (POS) in pediatric subjects 1 month to <4 years of age. The secondary objectives of the study were:  To evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin compared to placebo on the frequency of POS as determined by responder rate in pediatric subjects 1 month to <4 years of age.  To assess the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in pediatric subjects 1 month to <4 years of age with POS. METHODS Study Design: This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 pregabalin doses administered 3 times daily (TID) as adjunctive therapy in pediatric subjects 1 month to <4 years of age with POS, with or without secondary generalization. Approximately 150 subjects were planned to be enrolled in this study. Subjects were required to maintain a stable dose of 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) throughout the study. Randomization was stratified by site and subject age, as follows:  Stratum 1: 1 month and <1 year of age  Stratum 2: 1 to 2 years of age  Stratum 3: >2 years of age and <4 years of age The study was composed of 4 phases, a baseline video-electroencephalogram (V-EEG) phase (48-72 hours in duration), a 5-day double-blind dose escalation phase, a 9-day double-blind fixed-dose phase (including V-EEG recording of 48-72 hours over the final 3 days of the phase), and a 7-day double-blind taper phase. The total duration of the double-blind treatment phase (inclusive of the dose-escalation phase, fixed-dose phase, and taper phase) was 21 days. Every reasonable attempt was made to obtain the minimum target V-EEG recording of 48 hours and up to 72 hours if possible. Hereafter, “V-EEG assessment” will refer to the entire V-EEG monitoring period, which may have lasted up to 72 hours. Figure 1 presents a diagram of the study design for Study A0081042. Figure 1.

Abbreviations: EEG = electroencephalogram; V=Visit. Subjects who completed the baseline phase and met the eligibility criteria were randomized to treatment at Visit 3. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day (6 mg/kg/day for subjects 1 to 3 months of age), pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day (12 mg/kg/day for subjects 1 to 3 months of age), or placebo, respectively. Subjects randomized to pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day started treatment with pregabalin 3.5 mg/kg/day for 5 days and then received 7 mg/kg/day. Subjects randomized to pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day received 3.5 mg/kg/day for 2 days, 7 mg/kg/day for 3 days, and then 14 mg/kg/day. Daily dosing for each subject was recorded by parent(s)/guardian(s)/caregiver(s), as appropriate, in a daily dosing diary. Table 1 presents the schedule of activities for this study. Subjects who participated in Study A0081042 through Visit 7 (End of Study/Early Termination) were considered to have completed the study. Subjects who completed the study were eligible for screening into Study A0081106, a 1-year open-label safety study. In addition, subjects who received at least 1 dose during the fixed-dose phase but withdrew could also be considered for screening into Study A0081106. Table 1.

Eligible subjects were receiving a stable dose (within 7 days of screening) of 1 to 3 AEDs, must have had at least 3 observed seizures in the month prior to screening, and must have had at least 2 POS during the 48-hour baseline V-EEG phase, as determined by the investigator or designee. Potential subjects were excluded from the study if they had primary generalized seizures, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes, and/or Dravet syndrome. Subjects with a diagnosis of febrile seizures, seizures related to an ongoing medical illness, progressive structural central nervous system (CNS) lesion, progressive encephalopathy, progressive errors of metabolism, known or suspected chronic hematologic, hepatic, or renal disease were excluded from the study. Pregabalin 20 mg/mL and matching placebo oral solutions were provided as clear, colorless solutions containing sweetening (sucralose) and flavoring (artificial strawberry) agents in child-resistant bottles. Pregabalin or matching placebo was administered orally TID. The dose (volume of solution) was based on the age and weight of the subject at Visit 3 (randomization) and randomized treatment group All subjects randomized to receive pregabalin started at 3.5 mg/kg/day (3 mg/kg/day for subjects 1 to 3 months of age) during the 5-day dose-escalation phase, escalated to the final level for their randomized treatment during the 9-day fixed-dose phase, then tapered back to 3.5 mg/kg/day (3 mg/kg/day for subjects 1 to 3 months of age) during the 7-day taper phase. Efficacy Endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was:  The log-transformed double-blind 24-hour seizure rate for all POS collected at Visit 6 (48-72 hour V-EEG assessment phase) during the double-blind phase as determined by the central reader. The secondary efficacy endpoint of the study was:  Responder rate, defined as subjects who had 50% reduction from baseline in partial seizure rate during the double-blind V-EEG assessment. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory data, physical examinations, vital signs, neurological examinations, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Two interim reviews of safety data were also conducted by an External Data Monitoring Committee (E-DMC). The purpose of the interim safety reviews was to review deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), and discontinuations due to AEs. Statistical Methods: The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, defined as the primary efficacy population that consisted of randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug during the double-blind treatment phase, had a baseline with at least 1 POS identified by V-EEG as determined by the central reader, and a treatment phase V-EEG, was the primary analysis population. The safety analysis set included all subjects who took at least one dose of study drug. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the log-transformed double-blind 24-hour seizure rate collected during the double-blind V-EEG assessment at Visit 6 as determined by the central reader. This 24-hour seizure rate was calculated as follows for the double-blind treatment phase: # of hours of V - EEG monitoring * “double-blind 48-hour assessment phase” refers to the entire double-blind V-EEG monitoring period, which may have lasted up to 72 hours. Baseline 24-hour EEG seizure rate was calculated in the same manner described above, using the baseline V-EEG assessment. When the log-transformation was used, the quantity 1 was added to the double-blind 24-hour seizure rate for all subjects to account for any possible “0” seizure incidence. This resulted in the following primary efficacy measure: log (double-blind 24-hour EEG seizure rate + 1). e Results were reported as “percent change in seizures” relative to placebo using the following back-transformation: A minimum of 24 hours of evaluable V-EEG recording was required. For subjects who had less than 24 hours of evaluable V-EEG recording, as determined by the central reader, their seizure rate was set to missing. The primary analysis was performed on the primary endpoint using a linear model with treatment, age stratum, geographical region (ie, North America + Europe + Middle East, Asia Pacific, Rest of the World) and baseline log seizure rate as a continuous covariate. This linear model included both dose groups of pregabalin. A sequential step-wise test procedure was used to control for multiplicity of testing such that the experimental-wise type I error rate did not exceed the 5% level of significance. For the key secondary efficacy endpoint, comparisons were performed for each pregabalin dose relative to placebo using maximum likelihood tests and confidence intervals. The definitive statistical summary for treatment group comparisons was the odds ratio. The responder outcomes were summarized by treatment group using counts and percentages. Safety data were tabulated and listed according to Pfizer’s standard reporting algorithms. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 231 subjects were screened for inclusion in this study, of which 175 subjects were randomized to a treatment group: 71 subjects to pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day, 34 subjects to pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day, and 70 subjects to placebo. No subjects were noted by the central reader to have an exclusionary seizure type. Of the 175 randomized subjects, 175 (100.0%) subjects took at least 1 dose of study drug mg/kg/day group, and 67 (95.7%) subjects in the placebo group. Overall, 6 (3.4%) subjects discontinued from the study: 2 (2.8%) subjects in the pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day group, 1 (2.9%) subject in the pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day group, and 3 (4.3%) subjects in the placebo group. A total of 140 (80.0%) subjects were included in the mITT population: 59 (83.1%) subjects in the pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day group, 28 (82.4%) subjects in the pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day group, and 53 (75.7%) subjects in the placebo group.

Number of subjects analyzed for laboratory data is the number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication and with at least 1 laboratory test during study treatment. The mITT population was the primary efficacy population and consisted of randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug during the double-blind treatment phase, had a baseline with at least 1 POS seizure identified by V-EEG, and a treatment phase V-EEG. The ITT population consisted of randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug during the double-blind treatment phase and had a baseline with at least 1 POS identified by V-EEG. Adverse events are checked for related/not related to study drug. Other discontinuation categories are automatically assigned. Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; ITT = intent-to-treat; mITT = modified intent-to-treat; POS = partial onset seizure; V-EEG = video-electroencephalogram. Demographic characteristics were comparable across treatment groups at baseline. Subjects the mITT population, baseline median 24-hour seizure frequency was 4.66 for the pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day group, 5.41 for the pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day group, and 2.93 for the placebo group. A summary of subject demographic characteristics and baseline seizure frequency is presented in Table 4.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Efficacy was demonstrated in this study with pregabalin 14 mg/kg/day compared to placebo based on analysis of log-transformed 24-hour seizure rate (p=0.0223). This corresponded to a percent reduction in seizures of 43.9% relative to placebo. Pregabalin 7 mg/kg/day did not show improvement relative to placebo in log-transformed 24-hour seizure rate (p=0.4606). A statistical summary of log-transformed 24-hour seizure rate (POS) during the double-blind treatment phase for the mITT population is presented in Table 5.

Responder was defined as subjects who had a 50% reduction from baseline in partial seizure rate during the double-blind V-EEG assessment. Note: the odds ratio, its 95% CI, and p-value were from a logistic regression model with terms for treatment, age strata, and region. The odds ratio and its 95% CI were calculated by exponentiating the log odds ratio and 95% CI that corresponded to the treatment contrast in the logistic regression model. Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; V-EEG = video-electroencephalogram; mITT = modified intent-to- treat. Safety Results: Across all treatment groups, there were no clinically significant findings for safety assessments including laboratory results, physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, and ECGs.
