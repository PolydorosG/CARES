Abbreviation Definition Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) The final protocol (Appendix 16.1.1) was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board(s) (IRB) and/or Independent Ethics Committee(s) (IEC) of the investigational centers participating in the study. The IRBs and/or IECs are listed in Appendix 16.1.3.1. Ethical Conduct of the Study This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with all International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines. In addition, all local regulatory requirements were followed, in particular, those affording greater protection to the safety of trial participants. INTRODUCTION Dacomitinib is an orally available, selective adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive irreversible small-molecule inhibitor of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, HER-1), HER-2 receptor, and HER-4 receptor, and their oncogenic variants (eg, EGFR with exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations). Dacomitinib is being developed globally in locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Indications of activity have been seen in a number of dacomitinib clinical trials. This treatment extension study permitted continued access to dacomitinib for patients in Japan who participated in other dacomitinib monotherapy treatment studies and had the potential to derive clinical benefit without unacceptable toxicity from continued dacomitinib treatment. Patients were required to follow a schedule of visits and data collection that permitted continued safety monitoring. Therefore, the results of the study are being reported in a synopsis study report. STUDY PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Table 1. Study Objectives and Endpoints Source: Appendix 16.1.1 Study Design This was a multi-center, open-label, treatment extension study open in Japan only. Eligible patients included those with advanced NSCLC who received and tolerated single-agent dacomitinib in a prior clinical study in Japan (A7471009 and A7471050) and had the potential to derive continued clinical benefit based on investigator judgment. Patients enrolled in this treatment extension study would continue to receive dacomitinib starting at the current dose level in the prior study. Dose reductions and re-escalations were allowed based on tolerability. Patients could continue to be treated with dacomitinib on this study as long as there was evidence of clinical benefit in the judgment of the investigator. Refer to Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 3, Protocol Table 1, and Protocol Section 6.1 for more details of the study design, Schedule of Activities, and patient withdrawal procedure, respectively. Selection of Study Population As described above, patients with advanced NSCLC from prior studies in Japan for dacomitinib were eligible for this study. Patients had to meet all eligibility criteria to participate in this study. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Key inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. For a full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, refer to Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Sections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. Key inclusion criteria were as follows: 1. Received dacomitinib on another clinical trial in Japan and judged by the investigator to be deriving ongoing clinical benefit. 2. No ongoing National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or intolerable Grade 2 adverse events (AEs) related to dacomitinib treatment on the prior study. Key exclusion criteria were as follows: 1. Patients who met 1 or more study withdrawal criteria on the prior study using dacomitinib in Japan. 2. Participation in other studies involving other investigational drug(s) (Phases 1-4) when treatment in the current study began and/or during study participation. Treatments Patients were to receive continuous daily dosing of dacomitinib at a dose of 45 mg, 30 mg, or 15 mg. The starting dose of dacomitinib on this treatment extension study was the patient’s administration. Dose modifications were to be applied to patients in order to manage treatment-related toxicity that was not controlled by optimal supportive care, or not tolerated due to symptomatology or interference with normal daily activities regardless of severity. Dose reductions could have taken place whenever toxicity that was not controlled with optimal supportive care was noted during the study. Refer to Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 5 for more details of study treatment. Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Safety and/or Other Evaluations Efficacy Evaluations (Not Applicable) There were no efficacy evaluations done in this study. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and/or Other Evaluations (Not Applicable) There were no pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic or other non-safety evaluations done in this study. Safety Evaluations Safety evaluations are described in Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Sections 7 and 8. Statistical Methods Planned in the Protocol and Determination of Sample Size Determination of Sample Size: Due to the nature of this study, the number of patients to be enrolled was not predetermined. Safety Analysis: Safety analysis set was the as-treated population which included all patients who received at least 1 dose of dacomitinib. Safety data were summarized using descriptive statistics, and no inferential analyses were planned. Refer to Appendix 16.1.1, Protocol Section 9, and Appendix 16.1.9.1, Statistical Analysis Plan Section 6 for more details of the analyses for this study. RESULTS Patient Disposition and Data Sets Analyzed A total of 7 patients were enrolled and received study treatment, all of whom were analyzed for safety (Table 2). The 7 patients consisted of 5 patients from Study A7471009 and 2 patients from Study A7471050 (Table 16.2.1.1). All 7 patients permanently discontinued from treatment phase, with reasons of objective progression/relapse (3 patients), study termination by sponsor (as commercial dacomitinib became available) (3 patients), and global deterioration of health status (1 patient).

BMI was defined as weight/(height × 0.01)2. Protocol Deviations As listed in Appendix 16.2.2, there was 1 protocol deviation deemed important for this study. The interval of tumor assessments for 1 patient was longer than the protocol-specified ≤6 months. This deviation did not affect the overall results or conclusions of the study. GCP compliance was maintained. Safety Results Extent of Exposure: Duration of treatment is summarized in Table 4. The starting dose of dacomitinib was 15 mg for 5 patients and 30 mg for the other 2 patients. The median duration of study treatment for the 7 patients was 55 weeks (range: 40 to 195 weeks). Table 4.

Dosing interruption was defined as a dosing interval of any duration with daily dose of 0 mg. Dose reduction was defined as a reduction by ≥33% but <100% from the previously administered non-zero dose, for any reason. Cumulative dose = actual total dose received as recorded on CRF. Relative dose intensity was defined as percent of actual total dose received relative to intended total dose. a. Intended total dose = (prescribed daily dose at beginning of the study) × (actual dose duration). b. Intended total dose = 45 mg × (actual dose duration). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs): An overview of all-causality and treatment-related TEAEs is provided in Table 6. Of the 64 TEAEs reported by the 7 patients, 27 TEAEs (reported by 6 patients) were considered treatment-related. None of the TEAEs resulted in a permanent treatment discontinuation. Temporary treatment discontinuations (ie, dosing interruptions) due to TEAEs are listed by patient in Table 14.3.1.1.2. There were no Grade 5 TEAEs during the study.

Except for the number of AEs, patients were counted only once per treatment in each row. Included all data collected since the first dose of study drug. SAEs were determined according to the investigator’s assessment. Severity counts were based on the maximum severity or grade of events. MedDRA (version 22.0) coding dictionary applied. a. There was 1 patient (with 30 mg starting dose) who temporarily discontinued dacomitinib treatment due to AEs (Grade 2 Paronychia and Pruritus) for 2 weeks, followed by dacomitinib treatment resuming at 15 mg (Tables 14.3.1.1.2 and 16.2.5.1.1). These AEs were captured as temporary discontinuation associated AEs but not as dose reduction associated AEs in the CRF (Table 14.3.1.1.2); the dose resuming at 15 mg was counted as a dose reduction (Table 5 and Table 16.2.5.1.2). The incidence of TEAEs is summarized by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC), preferred term, and maximum CTCAE grade in Table 7 (all-causality) and Table 8 (treatment-related). All TEAEs were Grade ≤3 and were reported in ≤2 patients (Table 7). All the Grade 3 TEAEs were resolved and considered as unrelated to treatment (Table 16.2.7.1). Treatment-related TEAEs were all Grade ≤2 (Table 8). The treatment-related TEAEs reported in >1 patient were Diarrhoea, Paronychia, and Dry skin (2 patients each). A total of 3 treatment-emergent serious AEs (SAEs) were reported by 2 patients in this study, including: • A Grade 2 Ileus and a Grade 3 Lung infection (by a patient with 15 mg dose), both of which resulted in a temporary discontinuation of study drug; • A Grade 3 Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (by a patient with 15 mg dose) with no action taken for study drug (Tables 14.3.2.2.1 and 14.3.2.2.2). None of the SAEs were considered treatment-related (Table 14.3.2.2.1).

Death Narratives (Not Applicable) There were no deaths reported during the study. None of the SAEs was considered treatment-related or associated with permanent treatment discontinuation; therefore no corresponding narratives were created. Other Significant Adverse Events Narratives (Not Applicable) There were no other significant AEs reported during the study. CONCLUSIONS • The study met its primary objective of providing access to dacomitinib for 7 eligible Japanese patients. • Dacomitinib was generally safe and well-tolerated in this study. There were no Grade 5 TEAEs or permanent treatment discontinuations associated with TEAEs in this study. All treatment-related TEAEs were Grade ≤2. NOTE: Since this is a synopsis study report, not all of the tables applicable to a full study report are necessarily included. Therefore, there may be gaps in the sequences of table numbers. The report has been carefully reviewed to ensure that all relevant tables are present.
