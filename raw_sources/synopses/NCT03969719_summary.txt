Table S1. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints To evaluate the effects of 2 dose  Change from baseline in levels of PF-06835919 compared to HbA1c at all timepoints placebo on HbA1c. other than Week 16. METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 2a, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PD of PF-06835919 administered once daily (QD) for 16 weeks in adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on stable doses of metformin. A fixed, single-blind, placebo run-in period of approximately 14 days following confirmation of eligibility and prior to randomization (ie, Visit 4 to Visit 6) was included to familiarize participants with the study treatment regimen and to exclude participants who were not compliant with single-blind placebo administration prior to randomization at Day 1 (Visit 6). A total of approximately 150 participants (50 per arm) were to be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 between PF-06835919 at 150 mg and 300 mg, and placebo to ensure a minimum of approximately 132 participants (44 per arm) complete. The dropout rate for this study was presumed to be not more than approximately 12%. A total of 164 participants were actually randomized in this study. For individual participants, the total duration of the study from the Screen 1 visit to the on-site follow-up visit (Visit 13) was approximately 24 weeks. The time between Screen 1 (Visit 1) and Screen 3 (Visit 3) was approximately 3 weeks, and approximately 6 weeks (42 days) between Screen 1 (Visit 1) and Day 1 (Visit 6) (Figure S1). Figure S1. Study Design Schematic ^This visit was to occur at the local, sponsor-approved imaging facility. *This visit was only applicable to participants involved in the sub-study. Participants returned to the site for distribution of food and water diary, placement of devices, received instructions for use, and reported AEs. Investigational product did not need to be administered at the site. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Male or female participants between the ages of 18 and 70 years, inclusive, at Visit 1 (Screen 1). Females had to be of non-childbearing potential.  Participants with T2DM on stable doses (500 mg/day) of metformin monotherapy for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screen 1).  At Visit 1 (Screen 1), waist circumference >102 centimeters for males and >89 centimeters for females with a maximum that allowed for a participant to fit comfortably within the MRI machine.  At Visit 3 (Screen 3), liver fat 8% measured by MRI-PDFF acquisition protocol at the sponsor-qualified imaging facility, confirmed via a single repeat, if deemed necessary by the sponsor-identified central imaging vendor.  HbA1c at Screen 1 (Visit 1), as assessed by the sponsor-identified central laboratory of 7.0-10.5%, inclusive. A single repeat was allowed, if deemed necessary.  At Visit 1 (Screen 1), total body weight of >50 kg (110 pounds [lbs]) and a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 – 40.0 kg/m2, inclusive. Study Treatment: This study was planned as a 3-arm, parallel group study with 2 active PF-06835919 treatment arms (150 mg QD and 300 mg QD) and placebo to evaluate changes in liver fat and HbA1c in participants with elevated liver fat and T2DM. Participants took a total of 3 tablets of PF 06835919 and/or placebo at approximately the same time each day (recommended to be taken with the morning meal). Dosing was witnessed by the investigator site staff at Visit 4, and Visits 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12. Participants were instructed to delay self-administration of investigational product and concomitant medications on scheduled visit days until they arrived for their outpatient clinic visit, except participants in the sub-study at their Week 14 (Visit 11). At visits when participants reported to the imaging center, dosing and breakfast had to be delayed until completion of the MRI-PDFF procedure. The investigational product information is provided in Table S2. Table S2. Investigational Product Description Efficacy Evaluations: At scheduled visits, liver fat was assessed via MRI using the PDFF acquisition protocol. A participant’s eligibility for this study based on liver fat as assessed via MRI-PDFF at Screen 3 (Visit 3) was made by the sponsor-identified central imaging vendor only. The MRI images were reviewed by a sponsor-identified central imaging vendor. PD Evaluations: Fasting plasma glucose was collected as part of the clinical laboratory tests. In addition, a sufficient amount of blood was collected for analysis of plasma insulin and HbA1c. HOMA-IR values were derived from fasting plasma insulin and glucose values. Approximately 2.5 mL of blood was collected to ensure sufficient serum for analysis of hs-CRP. These samples were processed and shipped for analysis to the sponsor-identified central laboratory. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included AEs, hypoglycemia AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and 12-lead ECGs. Statistical Methods: The primary Efficacy and PD endpoints and secondary PD endpoints were analyzed using Primary Estimand. The Primary Estimand was intended to provide a population level estimate of the treatment effect of the investigational product alone relative to placebo under the scenario of no discontinuation of study intervention, without the potential confounding effects of additional prohibited medications, regardless of the participant’s compliance with the investigational product dosing. Efficacy The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all participants randomly assigned to treatment and who took at least 1 dose of treatment. The percent change from baseline in whole liver fat using MRI-PDFF at Week 16 was the derived endpoint. Baseline was the measurement obtained at Visit 5 prior to randomization. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed on log-transformed change from baseline with treatment and log-transformed baseline whole liver PDFF value as covariates. Estimates of the mean relative differences between each active dose and placebo at Week 16 and the corresponding 90% confidence interval (CI) were obtained from the model to estimate the effect of the initially randomized treatment regardless of treatment compliance. Comparison of each PF-06835919 dose with the placebo was performed at a Type I error rate of 10% (2-sided). No adjustment for multiple comparisons was made. This analysis utilized the FAS. PD The change from baseline in HbA1c at post-baseline visits was the derived endpoint. Baseline was the closest measurement prior to first dose on Day 1. Analysis using mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) was performed on change from baseline with treatment, time and treatment by time interaction as fixed effects and baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. Time was fitted as a repeated effect. Estimates of the mean differences between each active dose and placebo at all post-baseline time points including the primary time point of Week 16 and the corresponding 90% CIs were obtained from the model to estimate the effect of the initially randomized treatment regardless of treatment compliance. Comparison of each PF-06835919 dose with the placebo was performed at a Type I error rate of 10% (2-sided). No adjustment for multiple comparisons was made. This analysis utilized the FAS. For hs-CRP and ALT, the derived endpoint was the percent change from baseline. For measures of glycemic metabolism namely, fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, and HOMA-IR, the derived endpoint was the change from baseline. Baseline was the closest measurement prior to first dose on Day 1. The derived endpoints were analyzed using MMRM with treatment, time and treatment by time interaction as fixed effects and baseline value as a covariate. If the MMRM did not fit the data then group medians and differences in group medians from placebo with 90% CIs were to be provided at each post-baseline time point to estimate the effect of the initially randomized treatment regardless of treatment compliance. This analysis utilized the FAS. Safety The safety analysis set included all participants who were randomly assigned to treatment and took at least 1 dose of treatment. The safety endpoints were listed and summarized in accordance with sponsor reporting standards. All safety data were to be summarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulations, descriptive statistics, categorical summaries, and graphical presentations to evaluate any potential risk associated with the safety and toleration of administering PF-06835919. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 164 participants (71 males and 93 females) were randomized and treated.  The mean age of all treated participants was 58.8 years; the mean BMI was 32.36 kg/m2.  The majority of participants were White (76.8%). A total of 145 (88.4%) participants completed the double-blind treatment (Table S3).  A total of 19 participants discontinued the double-blind treatment: 4 (7.4%) participants in the placebo group, 9 (16.4%) participants in the PF-06835919 150 mg group, and 6 (10.9%) participants in the PF-06835919 300 mg group.  In the overall population, the most common reason for discontinuation during the double-blind treatment period was withdrawal by participant (7 [4.3%] participants).  Only 4 (2.4%) participants discontinued the double-blind treatment due to AEs. A total of 145 (88.4%) participants completed the treatment period and 146 (89.0%) participants completed follow-up period (Table S3).  Among the 19 participants who discontinued the double-blind treatment, 1 participant in the PF-06835919 300 mg group remained in the follow-up period of this study. Efficacy Results: Primary Endpoint - Whole Liver Fat Percent Change From Baseline at Week 16 Using MRI-PDFF Log-transformed response ratio at Week 16 to baseline in whole liver fat by MRI-PDFF was analyzed using ANCOVA, with treatment and log-transformed baseline whole liver fat by MRI-PDFF as covariates. Model-derived estimates were back-transformed from the log scale and converted to percent change. Both PF-06835919 dose groups demonstrated greater reductions in whole liver fat using MRI-PDFF as compared to placebo at Week 16. The primary statistical analyses results of log-transformed response ratios to baseline in  At Week 16, LS mean whole liver fat was reduced by 19.13% at PF-06835919 300 mg dose and 17.05% at PF-06835919 150 mg dose, compared with 5.26% for placebo based on ANCOVA (Primary Estimand).  The placebo-adjusted effects (and 90% CI) were -14.64% (-24.18%, -3.89%) and -12.44% (-22.37%, -1.25%) for the PF-06835919 300 mg and 150 mg doses, respectively. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Figure S2. Least Squares Means With 90% Confidence Intervals of Percent Change From Baseline in Whole Liver Fat Using MRI-PDFF at Week 16 - Primary Estimand PD Results: Primary Endpoint - HbA1c Change From Baseline at Week 16 Change from baseline to Week 16 in HbA1c was analyzed using the MMRM with treatment, time and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, and baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. The primary statistical analyses results based on Primary Estimand are provided in Table S5 and Figure S3.  The LS mean differences (and 90% CI) to placebo in HbA1c at Week 16 were -0.08% (-0.36%, 0.20%) and -0.25% (-0.52%, 0.02%) for the PF-06835919 150 mg and 300 mg doses, respectively. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Figure S3. Least Squares Means With 90% CIs for Change From Baseline in HbA1c at Week 16 - Primary Estimand Secondary Endpoints Percent Change From Baseline in hs-CRP Over 16 Weeks There were reductions in median hs-CRP in the PF-06835919 300 mg group relative to placebo (ranging from -21.47% to -35.88% across Week 2 to Week 16). Smaller numerical reductions relative to placebo were observed in the PF-06835919 150 mg group (ranging from -0.60% to -13.90% across Week 2 to Week 16) based on Primary Estimand. Change From Baseline in Fasting Insulin, Glucose and HOMA-IR Over 16 Weeks Insulin PF-06835919 300 mg demonstrated median numerical reductions from baseline in insulin compared to placebo beginning at Week 2 through Week 16 based on Primary Estimand. The size of the placebo adjusted effects ranged from -0.40 mIU/L to -1.40 mIU/L across visits but with 90% CIs containing 0, indicating that it was credible that there was no effect. There were no notable differences in insulin change from baseline between the PF-06835919 150 mg group and the placebo group over time. Glucose Reductions from placebo in median fasting plasma glucose beginning at Week 2 through Week 16 were observed for both of the PF-06835919 150 mg group (median differences from placebo ranging from -2.00 mg/dL to -12.00 mg/dL across visits) and 300 mg group (median differences from placebo ranging from -16.00 mg/dL to -18.00 mg/dL across visits) based on Primary Estimand. The magnitude of effects for PF-06835919 300 mg (but not PF-06835919 150 mg) clearly separated from placebo with 90% CIs excluding 0 at all timepoints. HOMA-IR Reductions from placebo in median HOMA-IR beginning at Week 2 through Week 16 were observed for both of the PF-06835919 150 mg group (ranging from -0.06 to -0.40 across visits) and 300 mg group (ranging from -0.16 to -1.33 across visits) with the PF-06835919 300 mg effects detectably different to placebo (90% CIs excluded 0) at Week 8 and Week 16 based on Primary Estimand. Percent Change From Baseline in ALT Over 16 Weeks Reductions from placebo for ALT were observed for both of the PF-06835919 150 mg and 300 mg groups at all timepoints except Week 12 based on Primary Estimand. The largest reductions from placebo were at Week 16 with median ALT 15.26% (90% CI: -30.05%, -0.48%) and 16.76% (90% CI: -31.98%, -1.55%) lower than placebo for Change From Baseline in HbA1c at All Timepoints Other Than Week 16 The LS mean reductions from baseline in HbA1c were observed beginning at Week 2 through Week 16 in the placebo group and in both PF-06835919 treatment groups based on MMRM (Primary Estimand), with slightly greater reductions observed in the PF-06835919 300 mg group as compared to the PF-06835919 150 mg and placebo groups from Week 4 to Week 16. No statistically significant differences (90% CIs included 0 at all timepoints) in the HbA1c reduction were observed between the PF-06835919 dose groups and the placebo group. Safety Results: AEs An overview of all-causality and treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), by treatment group, is provided in Table S6.  In this study, there were 22 (40.7%), 25 (45.5%) and 18 (32.7%) participants that experienced at least 1 all-causality TEAE in the placebo, PF-06835919 150 mg and PF-06835919 300 mg groups, respectively. Of these participants, 2 (3.6%) participants in the PF-06835919 150 mg group and 1 (1.8%) participant in the PF-06835919 300 mg group experienced TEAEs in severe intensity; none of these severe TEAEs were considered as treatment-related.  There was no apparent dose-related increase in frequency of TEAEs with PF-06835919.  In this study, 1 SAE was reported in 1 participant in the PF-06835919 150 mg group, which was reported as not treatment-related. The incidence of all-causality TEAEs was similar between the placebo and PF-06835919 treatment groups, with 25 (45.5%) participants in the PF-06835919 150 mg group and 18 (32.7%) participants in the PF-06835919 300 mg group, compared with 22 (40.7%) participants in the placebo group. The most commonly reported all-causality TEAEs, reported in at least 4 participants in the study, were diarrhoea, headache, abdominal pain, hyperglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia. For these TEAEs, there was no clear imbalance between the placebo and PF-06835919 groups, with the exception of hyperglycaemia, which occurred only in the PF-06835919 150 mg group. The majority of the all-causality TEAEs were mild in severity. Overall, the proportion of participants experiencing treatment-related TEAEs was low across the treatment groups with 4 (7.3%) participants in the PF-06835919 150 mg group and 1 (1.8%) participant in the PF-06835919 300 mg group reporting treatment-related TEAEs, compared with 2 (3.7%) participants in the placebo group. Two treatment-related TEAEs experienced by 2 (3.6%) participants in the PF-06835919 150 mg group and 1 treatment-related TEAE experienced by 1 (1.8%) participant in the PF-06835919 300 mg group were of moderate severity. The other 4 treatment-related TEAEs were all mild in severity. One participant in the PF-06835919 300 mg group discontinued the study drug due to a mild TEAE of anaemia but continued in the study, and this event was considered not related to treatment. Two participants discontinued permanently from study due to TEAEs, neither of which were considered as treatment-related.  One participant in the PF-06835919 150 mg group discontinued from study permanently due to a severe TEAE of hypertriglyceridaemia, which was considered not related to treatment.  Another participant in the PF-06835919 300 mg group discontinued from the study permanently due to a mild TEAE of pyrexia, which was considered not related to treatment. Two participants temporarily discontinued the study drug due to TEAEs that were considered as not treatment-related.  One participant in the placebo group temporarily discontinued the study drug due to mild TEAEs of diarrhoea and vomiting, and these events were not related to treatment.  Another participant in the PF-06835919 300 mg group temporarily discontinued the study drug due to a mild TEAE of dizziness, and this event was deemed not related to treatment. There were no deaths in this study. One participant in the PF-06835919 150 mg group experienced a severe SAE of SARS-CoV-2 test positive on Study Day 29 due to the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which was considered not related to treatment. Hypoglycemia AEs  In the placebo group, 3 (5.6%) participants experienced TEAEs of hypoglycaemia, among whom 1 (1.9%) participant had treatment-related hypoglycaemia.  In the PF-06835919 150 mg group, 1 (1.8%) participant experienced TEAE of hypoglycaemia, which was considered as treatment-related by the investigator. Any episode of hypoglycemia was captured on the hypoglycemia adverse event (HAE) case report form (CRF). The hypoglycemic AEs were summarized using the HAE CRF page.  One (1.9%) participant in the placebo group, 1 (1.8%) participant in the PF-06835919 150 mg group and no participants in the PF-06835919 300 mg group experienced asymptomatic hypoglycemia.  No participants experienced severe hypoglycemia, documented symptomatic hypoglycemia or probable symptomatic hypoglycemia. Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Without regard to baseline abnormality, the proportion of participants who had laboratory test abnormalities was similar across the 3 treatment groups (52 [98.1%], 52 [96.3%] and 51 [92.7%] participants in the placebo, PF-06835919 150 mg and PF-06835919 300 mg groups, respectively). Without regard to baseline abnormality, the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities in this study population with T2DM were fasting glucose 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), hemoglobin A1C 1.3 × ULN, urine glucose ≥1 and leukocyte esterase ≥1. Vital Signs The MMRM statistical analysis was used to analyze the change from baseline in pre-dose and 1-2 hours post-dose systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP and pulse rate.  Numerical LS mean increases from baseline in pre-dose sitting systolic BP were observed in the placebo group (1.17 mmHg) and PF-06835919 150 mg group (1.14 mmHg), with slightly greater increases from baseline observed with the PF-06835919 300 mg group (4.03 mmHg) at Week 16.  No clinically meaningful differences were observed in change from baseline in sitting systolic BP at 1-2 hours post-dose for either PF-06835919 dose group as compared to the placebo group.  Similarly, no significant differences were observed in changes from baseline in pre-dose or 1-2 hours post-dose sitting diastolic BP or pulse rate for either PF-06835919 dose group as compared with the placebo group. ECG ECG values were generally comparable across the 3 treatment groups. There were no clinically meaningful mean changes in ECG data in the treatment groups during the study. There were no participants with single post-dose value 500 msec for Q wave to end of T wave (QT) and QT corrected by Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) intervals. The maximum post-dose mean values for ECG intervals were similar across the 3 treatment groups, and the mean ECG maximum increases from baseline were similar across the 3 treatment groups. There did not appear to be an association between changes from baseline in mean ECG parameters and increasing doses of PF-06835919. Conclusions: The study objectives for C1061011 were successfully evaluated in participants with T2DM and NAFLD. Efficacy  Both PF-06835919 doses demonstrated declines from baseline in whole liver fat assessed by MRI-PDFF at Week 16. The placebo-adjusted effects (and 90% CI) were -14.64% (-24.18%, -3.89%) and -12.44% (-22.37%, -1.25%) for the PF-06835919 300 mg and 150 mg doses, respectively. PD  Small numerical decreases in HbA1c were observed with both PF-06835919 doses but the effect sizes were not detectably different to placebo. The placebo-adjusted effects (and 90% CI) at Week 16 were -0.25% (-0.52%, 0.02%) and -0.08% (-0.36%, 0.20%) for the PF-06835919 300 mg and 150 mg doses, respectively.  Reductions from baseline over time were observed for both PF-06835919 doses, compared with placebo for the key secondary endpoint of fasting plasma glucose. PF-06835919 300 mg demonstrated median reductions from baseline in hs-CRP compared to placebo over time while the changes with PF-06835919 150 mg dose were smaller. No meaningful changes were observed in other secondary endpoints measured at either dose of PF-06835919. Safety  PF-06835919 administered at 150 mg and 300 mg QD over 16 weeks was generally safe well-tolerated in participants with NAFLD and T2DM.  Based on AE, laboratory and vital signs data collected, no clinically meaningful adverse trends were identified in participants with NAFLD and T2DM.
