J Clin Oncol 2016; 34(15 Suppl)(S):2566. Study Initiation Date: 10 September 2013 Study Completion Date: 08 January 2020 Report Date: 15 June 2020 Previous Report Date(s): Not Applicable Phase of Development: Phase 1b Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: The primary and secondary study objectives and endpoints are presented in Table S1 (dose escalation) and Table S2 (safety and efficacy expansion in patients with TNBC).  METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1b, three-arm, open-label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study of PF-05212384 in combination with anti-tumor agents in sequential cohorts of adult patients with select advanced solid tumors. Successive cohorts of patients received selected doses of PF-05212384 in combination with selected doses of chemotherapeutic agents or dacomitinib in 3 independent arms on an outpatient basis. Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in other (monotherapy) studies, the study tested increasing doses of PF-05212384 in combination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinib in order to select the best dose to administer in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) expansion portion of the study. Based on the rationale provided in the protocol, an expansion cohort opened with implementation of Protocol Amendment 5 to assess the clinical activity and continued overall safety profile of PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Dose Escalation Patients (age ≥18 years) with histological or cytological proven diagnosis of advanced slid tumor were enrolled. Arm A included patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), advanced breast cancer (ABC), or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Arm B included patients with urothelial transitional cell cancer (TCC), TNBC, NSCLC, or ovarian cancer (OC). Arm C included patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2+ breast cancer (BC) refractory to prior herceptin or lapatinib, HER2+ esophago-gastric cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), or NSCLC. For patients enrolled in the dose escalation phase, measurable or evaluable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1; for patients in the MTD cohorts, measurable disease is required. Expansion in Patients with TNBC Patients (age ≥18 years) with histological or cytological proven diagnosis of TNBC were enrolled. Measurable disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Study Treatment: Administration of PF-05212384 PF-05212384 was administered weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 30 minutes. The infusion of PF-05212384 was initiated approximately 30 minutes following the completion of the docetaxel or cisplatin infusion (Arms A and B) or immediately following the ingestion of the dacomitinib dose (Arm C). Administration of Docetaxel Docetaxel was administered intravenously at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The total docetaxel dose was administered as a 1-hour IV infusion. Administration of Cisplatin Cisplatin was administered intravenously at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The total dose was administered as a 2-hour IV infusion. Administration of Dacomitinib Patients self-administered dacomitinib orally, once daily (QD) on a continuous basis. Dacomitinib was supplied as 15 mg tablets and was taken on an empty stomach (defined as less than 500 calories within 2 hours before or after intake of study medication) and with at least 6 oz (180 mL) of water. Patients were instructed to swallow study drug tablets whole and not to chew them prior to swallowing. No tablet was ingested if it was broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact. Patients were instructed to take their medication at approximately the same time (3 hours) Study drug information is provided in Table S3. Table S3.

Tumor assessments included all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging included the chest (chest x-ray or high resolution computed tomography [CT]) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order to monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or non-target lesions in the chest. Imaging included abdomen and pelvis CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans if disease was being followed in these areas. A brain CT or MRI scan for patients with known or suspected brain metastases and bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with known or suspected bone metastases were required. The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline was employed in the follow-up tumor assessments. Anti-tumor activity was assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease progression was suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if not done in the previous 6 weeks). Patients who had a tumor assessment as standard of care within 28 days of the lead-in dose but prior to signing the informed consent document did not need to have a re-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data was available for entry onto the study case report form. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Other Evaluations: Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Blood samples (3 mL whole blood per sample collection timepoint) were collected for PK analysis of PF-05212384, docetaxel, and dacomitinib (and the desmethyl metabolite PF-05199265). A blood sample of 6 mL of whole blood per sample collection timepoint, was collected for the PK analysis of cisplatin. For the expansion cohort, blood samples (3 mL whole blood per sample collection timepoint) were collected for PK analysis of PF-05212384. Human plasma samples were analyzed for determination of PF-05212384 using a validated, sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS/MS) method in compliance with the sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs). Human plasma samples were analyzed for determination of docetaxel using a validated, sensitive and specific HPLC-MS/MS method in compliance with the sponsor’s SOPs. Human plasma samples were analyzed for determination of dacomitinib and PF-05199265 using a validated, sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-API/MS/MS) method in compliance with the sponsor’s SOPs. Human plasma samples were analyzed for determination of free and total cisplatin using a validated, sensitive and specific inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method in compliance with the sponsor’s SOPs. The following single and multiple dose plasma PK parameters (Table S4) for PF-05212384, docetaxel, platinum, ultra-filtrate platinum, dacomitinib and PF-05199265 (metabolite of dacomitinib) were calculated for each patient and treatment, as applicable, using noncompartmental analysis of plasma concentration-time data. Samples below the lower limit of quantification were set to 0 for analysis. Actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis. Nominal time post-dose was used for PK analysis if the actual sample collection time was missing. Table S4.

Pharmacodynamic Evaluation Details on preparation and handling of all biomarker samples including processing, storage, and shipment were provided in the Laboratory Manual. The source of the samples is listed Table S5. Pharmacodynamic and Molecular Analysis Samples Patient Reported Outcomes Evaluation Patient reported outcomes (PROs) of health-related quality of life (QOL) and breast cancer specific disease/treatment related symptoms were assessed using European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23). Patients completed each instrument at pre-dose on Day 1 and Day 8 of Cycles 1 and 2, on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle starting with Cycle 3 and at the end of treatment visit. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs and physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory safety assessments, as well as pregnancy tests and left ventricular ejection fraction measurements. Statistical Methods: Efficacy Does escalation: tumor response was presented in the form of patient data listings that included, but were not limited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. In addition, dates of progression, death, first response and last tumor assessment were listed. If the data permits, objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit response (CBR) rate were provided by arm and by tumor type. Unconfirmed objective response included complete response (CR) and PR (partial response). CBR included PR, CR and stable disease (SD) (24 weeks from the first dose to treatment failure). Expansion: Confirmed ORR, CBR rate, duration of response (DR), and progression free survival (PFS) were calculated for expansion Arms 1 and 2. Pharmacokinetics The PK parameter analysis population was defined as all enrolled patients who started treatment and who had sufficient information to estimate at least 1 of the PK parameters of interest. Plasma PK parameters for PF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib were estimated using non-compartmental analysis. The single dose and steady-state PK parameters were summarized descriptively by dose, cycle and day. For PF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib concentrations were summarized descriptively by dose, cycle, day and nominal time. Individual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data were plotted by dose, cycle and day (single dose and steady-state) using nominal times. Median profiles were presented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales. Pharmacodynamics For biopsy samples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, (percent coefficient of variation [%CV], and minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical biomarker measures) were determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. Data from biomarker assays were analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive statistics such as Wilcoxon rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Patient Reported Outcomes The number and percentage of patients who completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 were summarized in a table, as well the reasons for non-completion of these measures. The mean change of global QOL scores from baseline (and 95% confidence interval [CI]) was calculated. Repeated measures mixed model analyses were also conducted to estimate changes in scores over time. The number and proportion of patients who improved, worsened, or remained stable for all of the symptom and functional domains, global QOL, and single items of the QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR23 were summarized in a table. In addition to the above analyses, an examination of the time to deterioration (TTD) for Safety Summaries and analyses of safety parameters included all enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Summaries for safety endpoints were by dose escalation arm, dose level, and Arm B expansion arm.

Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Other Results: Pharmacokinetics Arm A PF-05212384 Pharmacokinetics: Following administration of a single IV infusion of PF-05212384, the median plasma PF-05212384 concentrations declined rapidly till 24 hours, followed by a slower log-linear decline over 24 to 168 hours post-dose. Maximum plasma concentration (C ) was max generally observed at the end of infusion (median time for C [T ] 0.5 to 0.55 hour). The max max geometric mean plasma PF-05212384 exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time profile [AUC] and C ) generally appeared to increase proportionally with increasing max PF-05212384 doses from 90 mg to 180 mg. Total variability in PF-05212384 exposure based on the geometric %CV ranged from 21% to 103% for AUC (AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time [AUC ], AUC from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable inf concentration [AUC ] and from time 0 to time tau [AUC ]) and from 21% to 154% for last tau C . The terminal half-life (t ) was similar across all treatment groups with mean values max ½ ranging between 31.42 and 35.86 hours except at the lower dose level of 90 mg (26.58 hours). Following administration of multiple once-weekly IV infusion doses of PF-05212384 in combination with a single IV infusion of docetaxel, the median plasma PF-05212384 concentration-time profiles appeared similar to that of single dose where a rapid decline followed by a slower log-linear decline was observed over 168 hours post-dose. While the geometric mean C was lower at the 90 mg and 110 mg PF-05212384 dose levels, no max general trend was observed between PF-05212384 exposure and doses. Similarly, PF-05212384 total exposure (AUC ) was lower at the 90 mg dose level and there was no tau general trend in the exposure with increasing dose levels. Total variability in PF-05212384 exposure based on geometric %CV ranged from 22% to 56% for AUC and from 26% to tau 53% for C . The geometric mean observed accumulation ratio (R ) ranged from 0.9498 to max ac 1.413 across the dose levels indicating no accumulation with repeated weekly dosing of PF-05212384. The mean t of PF-05212384 was increased at lower dose levels (90 mg to ½ 130 mg) when PF-05212384 was administered in combination with docetaxel compared to PF-05212384 administered alone. However, the mean t of PF-05212384 was similar at ½ higher dose levels (150 mg and 180 mg) for both modes of administration. Docetaxel Pharmacokinetics: Following administration of a single IV infusion of docetaxel alone, the median docetaxel concentrations declined in a multi-phasic fashion. The C values were observed at the end max of infusion with median T ranging from 1.00 to 1.12 hours. The geometric mean C max max values ranged from 946.7 to 2528 ng/mL and the total exposure (AUC ) ranged from 1280 last to 2748 ng•hr/mL across the treatment groups. Total variability in docetaxel exposure based on geometric %CV ranged from 11% to 102% for AUC (AUC and AUC ) and from 19% last inf to 161% for C . max Following administration of docetaxel IV infusion in combination with PF-05212384, the C values were observed at the end of infusion with median T ranging from 1.02 to max max 1.34 hours. The geometric mean C values ranged from 695.9 to 2457 ng/mL and the total max exposure (AUC ) ranged from 1383 to 2921 ng•hr/mL across the treatment groups. Total last variability in docetaxel exposure based on geometric %CV ranged from 26% to 136% for AUC (AUC and AUC ) and from 18% to 253% for C . last inf max Arm B PF-05212384 Pharmacokinetics: Following administration of a single IV infusion of PF-05212384, the median plasma PF-05212384 concentrations declined very rapidly till 24 hours, followed by a slower log-linear decline over 24 to 168 hours post-dose. The C values were observed at the end max of infusion with median T ranging from 0.50 to 0.58 hour. The geometric mean plasma max PF-05212384 exposure (AUC and C ) generally appeared to increase proportionally with max increasing PF-05212384 doses from 90 mg to 310 mg. Total variability in PF-05212384 exposure based on geometric %CV ranged from 14% to 65% for AUC (AUC , AUC and inf last AUC ) and from 6% to 76% for C . t was similar across all treatment groups with mean tau max ½ values ranging between 32.57 and 42.87 hours except at the lower dose level of 90 mg (26.38 hours). Following administration of multiple once-weekly IV infusions of PF-05212384 in combination with a single IV infusion of cisplatin, the median plasma PF-05212384 concentration-time profiles appeared similar to that of single dose where a rapid decline followed by a slower log-linear decline was observed over 168 hours post-dose. No trend was observed in the exposure of PF-05212384 with increasing dose levels. The geometric mean C values ranged from 6273 to 18730 ng/mL and the total exposure (AUC ) ranged max tau from 12690 to 38850 ng•hr/mL for the dose levels where sufficient patients were available to report means. Total variability in PF-05212384 exposure based on geometric %CV ranged from 46% to 77% for AUC and from 19% to 114% for C .
