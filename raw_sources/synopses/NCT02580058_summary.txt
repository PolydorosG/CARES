Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation Date: 21 December 2015 Primary Completion Date: 19 September 2018 Report Date: 30 April 2019 Previous Report Date(s): Not applicable Phase of Development: Phase 3 Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: The primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are outlined in Table 1. Table 1. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel 3-arm study in which approximately 550 patients who met the eligibility criteria were planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive avelumab alone, avelumab in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), or PLD alone as follows:  Arm A (Experimental, Avelumab Alone): Avelumab 10 mg/kg given as a 1-hour intravenous (IV) infusion every 2 weeks (Q2W);  Arm B (Experimental, Avelumab + PLD): Avelumab 10 mg/kg given as a 1-hour IV Q2W + PLD 40 mg/m2 given as a 1-hour IV infusion every 4 weeks (Q4W);  Arm C (Control, PLD Alone): PLD 40 mg/m2 given as a 1-hour IV infusion Q4W. Patients were stratified by platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant status, number of prior regimens (1 versus 2 or 3), and bulky disease (defined as presence of a tumor ≥5 cm) versus not. Cross-over was not permitted. The study included up to 4 periods:  Screening: Up to 28 days before randomization,  Study treatment: Treatment following randomization,  Short-term follow-up: Follow-up for 90 days after the last dose of study (hereafter referred to as follow-up),  Long-term follow-up: Follow-up until death, End of Study, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. Patients might have withdrawn from treatment at any time at their own request, or they might have been withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the patient to comply with the protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site. The final analysis of this study has been completed; however, this study remains open to allow the remaining patients currently enrolled in the Arm A or Arm B to continue receiving avelumab as a single-agent or in combination with PLD. These patients will be allowed to continue receiving avelumab based on the investigator’s assessment that the anticipated benefit outweighs the risks. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Eligible patients were adult patients (18 years of age or 20 years of age in Japan) with histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and who had platinum-resistant or status was required to be 0 to 1. Patients may have received up to 3 prior lines of systemic anticancer therapy for platinum-sensitive disease, a platinum containing regimen was required as their most recent therapy and no prior systemic therapy for platinum-resistant disease was allowed. Patients were required to have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 with at least 1 unidimensional measurable lesion that had not previously been irradiated. Study Treatment: Study drugs were administered by IV infusion. In the combination arm, PLD was administered on Day 1 of each cycle and on that day it was administered first before the avelumab infusion.

As of the data cut-off date (19 September 2018), anti-tumor activities were assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline (screening) and every 8 weeks thereafter until documented disease progression as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). Radiological tumor assessments were also conducted whenever disease progression was suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration) and at the time of withdrawal from the treatment (if not done in the previous 4 weeks). Complete, partial responses (CR, PR) and progressive disease were confirmed on repeated imaging 4 weeks after initial documentation. The Patient Report Outcome (PRO) questionnaires were administered on the first day of each treatment cycle as well as upon End of Treatment (EOT)/Study Withdrawal and Post Treatment Safety Follow-up (Days 30, 60 and 90). Table 3. Efficacy Evaluations Table 3 Efficacy Evaluations Biomarker Evaluations: Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor infiltrating CD8 positive (CD8+) T lymphocytes as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were candidate predictive biomarkers in this study. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA)/echocardiogram, ECOG performance and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: the key statistical methods are briefly summarized as below. Primary Efficacy The primary analyses of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) were performed based on BICR assessment using the full analysis set (FAS), which included all randomized patients. A stratified log rank test (1-sided) stratified by randomization stratification factors was performed. PFS time was summarized by treatment arm using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards (PH) model was fitted to compute the hazard ratio and the corresponding confidence interval (CI). In order to account for the group sequential design in this study, the repeated CI (RCI) method was used to construct the 2-sided RCI for the hazard ratio. A similar analysis was performed for the primary analysis of Overall Survival (OS). Secondary Efficacy  Sensitivity Analyses: Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the robustness of the primary analysis results for PFS based on BICR assessment and the primary analysis results of OS. The sensitivity analyses repeated the primary analysis (p-value, hazard ratio and 95% CIs) with modifications. PFS based on BICR assessment and OS were  PFS Based on Investigator Assessment: repeated the analysis for the PFS based on investigator assessment.  The Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on BICR and Investigator Assessments: were estimated by dividing the number of patients with objective response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) by the number of patients randomized to the respective treatment arm. The corresponding exact 2-sided 95% CIs are provided by treatment arm. The association of treatment and Objective Response (OR) was also tested by the General Association Statistic of the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (CMH) with the randomization strata taken into account.  Time to Response Based on BICR and Investigator Assessments: are summarized using simple descriptive statistics.  Duration of Response (DR) Based on BICR and Investigator Assessments: are summarized by treatment arm using Kaplan-Meier method. The median DR and 95% CI for the median are provided for each treatment arm.  Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on BICR and Investigator Assessments: defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, non-complete response/non-progressive disease or stable disease (SD), was calculated for each treatment arm, along with 2-sided 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method.  Subgroup Analyses: were performed for OS, PFS based on BICR assessment, OR based on BICR assessment and DR based on BICR assessment for the pre-specified subgroups.  PRO: descriptive summaries over time are provided for the PRO endpoints. The treatment effect on time-to-deterioration (TTD) in patient’s European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Ovarian Cancer 28 (EORTC QLQ-OV28) abdominal/gastrointestinal (GI) symptom subscale were estimated using a Cox’s PH model stratified by the randomization strata to calculate the hazard ratio for the experimental arms versus control arm. Kaplan-Meier estimates (product-limit estimates) are presented by treatment arm together with a summary of associated statistics including the median TTD time with 2-sided 95% CI.  Biomarkers: Appropriate statistical methods using biomarker analysis set was used to investigate any possible relationship of biomarker levels with avelumab anti-tumor efficacy relative to appropriate control arms. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize all patient characteristics, treatment administration/compliance, and safety parameters. The Safety Analysis Set was the primary population for safety evaluation, which included all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment (ie, avelumab or PLD). RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 566 patients were randomized (188 each to the avelumab arm and the avelumab in combination with PLD arm, and 190 to the PLD arm). Of the 566 patients randomized, 546 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug (187 in the avelumab arm, 182 in the combination arm, and 177 in the PLD arm) (Table 4). At the time of data cutoff (19 September 2018), of the 188 patients randomized to the combination treatment, 178 (94.7%) patients discontinued avelumab and 183 (97.3%) patients discontinued PLD. In the avelumab arm and the PLD arm, 182 (96.8%) and 190 (100.0%) patients discontinued from treatment, respectively (Table 4). Disease progression (progressive disease) was the primary reason for discontinuation from treatment (61.2% for avelumab and 53.7% for PLD in the combination arm, 71.8% in the avelumab arm and 49.5% in the PLD arm) (Table 4). Patients who discontinued from treatment and did not withdraw consent continued into the follow-up phase or directly into the long-term follow-up (if the patient initiated subsequent anti-cancer therapy at the EOT or by patient request). There were 389 patients and 386 patients entering the follow-up and long-term follow-up phases, respectively. The primary reasons for discontinuation from study during follow-up and long-term follow-up were “other” (including start of new therapy) and “death”, respectively. All enrolled patients were female, and the median age was 60 years old (range 26 to 86 years). Most of the patients were from Europe (48.8%), North America (25.4%) or Asian (20.7%). Patient accrual by geographic region, country and site was similar among the 3 treatment arms. The physical measurements at baseline were similar for the 3 treatment arms. The median (range) values of Body Mass Index and body surface area (BSA) for the overall population were 25.20 (range: 14.2 to 59.8) kg/m2 and 1.70 (range: 1.2 to 2.7) m2, respectively. The primary site of tumor was the ovary in the majority of patients (85.9%) followed by the peritoneum (8.7%) and the fallopian tube (5.5%). There were 251 (44.3%) patients who had a platinum-free interval of 0 to 3 months and 248 (43.8%) patients who had a platinum-free interval of >3 to 6 months. Efficacy Results: Primary – PFS Based on BICR Assessment A Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS based on BICR is displayed in Figure 1. Median PFS based on BICR assessment was 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.8, 1.9), 3.7 months (95% CI: 3.3, 5.1) and 3.5 months (95% CI: 2.1, 4.0) for the avelumab arm, the combination arm and the PLD arm, respectively. PFS based on BICR assessment crossed the futility boundary for both avelumab versus PLD and the combination treatment versus PLD comparisons at the time of the interim analysis (IA). Updated results as of the data cutoff show a stratified hazard ratio based on 279 PFS events of 1.68 (RCI: 1.320, 2.601; 1-sided nominal p-value: >0.9999) for comparison between avelumab versus PLD, and a stratified hazard ratio based on 259 PFS events of 0.78 (RCI: 0.587, 1.244; 1-sided nominal p-value: 0.0301) for comparison between the combination treatment versus PLD. Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier Plot of Progression-Free Survival (Primary Analysis) Based on BICR Assessment (RECIST v1.1) – Full Analysis Set Primary – OS A Kaplan-Meier plot of OS is displayed in Figure 2. As of the data cutoff, median OS was 11.8 months (95% CI: 8.9, 14.1), 15.7 months (95% CI: 12.7, 18.7) and 13.1 months (95% OS crossed the futility boundary for the avelumab versus PLD comparison at the time of the IA. Updated results show a stratified hazard ratio (avelumab versus PLD) of 1.14 (RCI: 0.948, 1.580; 1-sided nominal p-value: 0.8253) based on the 213 deaths. The stratified hazard ratio (combination treatment versus PLD) based on 206 deaths was 0.89 (RCI: 0.744, 1.241; 1-sided p-value: 0.2082), in favor of the combination treatment. The observed p-value for the combination treatment versus PLD did not cross the threshold for statistical significance. Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival - Full Analysis Set Secondary - Sensitivity Analysis for PFS Based on BICR Assessment The results of the sensitivity analyses were similar to those based on the primary analysis. Secondary - Sensitivity Analysis for OS The results of the sensitivity analyses were similar to those based on the primary analysis. Secondary - PFS Based on Investigator Assessment The outcome of the primary endpoint PFS based on BICR assessment was corroborated by the outcome of the secondary endpoint, PFS based on investigator assessment. Consistent with the BICR assessment, PFS based on investigator assessment was observed with a stratified hazard ratio of 1.79 (95% CI: 1.403, 2.281 1-sided p-value>0.9999) for the ; p-value=0.0600) for the comparison between the combination treatment versus PLD (Figure 3). Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier Plot of Progression-Free Survival Based on Investigator Assessment (RECIST v1.1) - Full Analysis Set Secondary - Best Overall Response (BOR) The observed ORR based on BICR assessment was 3.7% (95% CI: 1.5, 7.5) for avelumab, 13.3% (95% CI: 8.8, 19.0) for the combination treatment, and 4.2% (95% CI: 1.8, 8.1) for PLD. The stratified odds ratio was 0.890 (95% CI: 0.267, 2.901) and 3.458 (95% CI: 1.463, 9.096) for the comparison between avelumab and PLD and between the combination treatment and PLD, respectively. The proportion of patients with a BOR of confirmed CR was 0 for the avelumab and PLD arms, and 1.1% for the combination arm, whilst the proportion of patients with a BOR of progressive disease was almost half in the combination arm (31.9%) and the PLD arm (32.1%) as in the avelumab arm (53.7%). The ORR based on investigator assessment was 5.3% (95% CI: 2.6, 9.6) for avelumab and 9.5% (95% CI: 5.7, 14.6) for PLD, and 18.6% (95% CI: 13.3, 24.9) for the combination treatment. The stratified odds ratio was 0.538 (95% CI: 0.216, 1.279) and 2.167 (95% CI: 1.145, 4.242) for the comparison between avelumab and PLD and the comparison between the combination treatment and PLD, respectively. For patients who had an OR as assessed by BICR, the median time to response was 2.8 months for avelumab arm, 3.6 months for the combination arm and 3.7 months for the PLD arm. The median DR as assessed by BICR for patients who responded was 9.2 months, 8.5 months and 13.1 months for the avelumab arm, the combination arm and the PLD arm, respectively. As assessed by the investigator, for patients who had an OR, the median time to response was 1.9 months for the avelumab arm, 3.7 months for the combination arm and 3.5 months for the PLD arm. Secondary - DCR The DCR for the avelumab arm, the combination arm and the PLD arm was 33.0%, 57.4% and 48.9%, respectively, based on the BICR assessment; and was 34.0%, 61.7% and 54.7%, respectively, based on the investigator assessment. Secondary - Patient-Reported Outcomes The median TTD for EORTC QLQ-OV28 (the abdominal/GI subscale) was not estimable for the avelumab arm, 11.1 months for the combination arm and 10.6 months for the PLD arm. The hazard ratio (95% CI) was 1.41 (0.863, 2.306) for avelumab versus PLD and 1.24 (0.790, 1.934) for the combination treatment versus PLD. Biomarker Results Of the total population evaluable for the PD-L1 biomarker analysis, 57% had PD-L1 positive (PD-L1+) tumors; and the proportion of patients with PD-L1+ tumors of each treatment arm was similar. Within the combination arm, the median value of PFS based on BICR was slightly higher in the PD-L1+ subgroup as compared to the PD-L1- subgroup. The unstratified hazard ratio with respect to PFS based on BICR assessment in the PD-L1+ subgroup as compared to the PD-L1 negative (PD-L1-) subgroup was 0.95 within the avelumab arm, 0.71 within the combination arm and 1.16 within the PLD arm. The hazard ratios with respect to PFS in the PD-L1- subgroup were greater than 1 for both the avelumab alone and combination arms when compared to the PLD arm. The hazard ratios in the PD-L1+ subgroup were 1.45 for avelumab versus PLD and 0.65 for the combination treatment versus PLD. Within the combination arm, the median value of OS was higher in the PD-L1+ subgroup as compared to the PD-L1- subgroup. The unstratified hazard ratio with respect to OS in the PD-L1+ subgroup as compared to the PD-L1- subgroup was 0.62 within the avelumab arm, 0.65 within the combination arm and 0.99 within the PLD arm. The hazard ratios with respect to OS in the PD-L1- subgroup were greater than 1 for both the avelumab and the combination arms when compared to the PLD arm. The hazard ratios in the PD-L1+ subgroup were 0.83 for the avelumab arm versus the PLD arm, and 0.72 for the combination arm versus the PLD arm. Of the total population evaluable for the CD8 T cell biomarker analysis, 46% patients had CD8+ tumors; and the proportion of patients with CD8+ tumors of each treatment arm was similar. Within the combination arm, the median value of PFS based on BICR was higher in the CD8+ subgroup as compared to the CD8 negative (CD8-) subgroup. The unstratified hazard ratio with respect to PFS based on BICR assessment in the CD8+ subgroup as compared to the CD8- subgroup was 0.93 within the avelumab arm, 0.69 within the combination arm and 0.95 within the PLD arm. Hazard ratios with respect to PFS in the CD8- subgroup were 1.53 and 0.92 for the avelumab arm and the combination arm respectively when compared to the PLD arm. The hazard ratios in the CD8+ subgroup were 1.58 for the avelumab arm versus the PLD arm, and 0.64 for the combination arm versus the PLD arm. Within the combination arm, the median value of OS was higher in the CD8+ subgroup as compared to the CD8- subgroup. The unstratified hazard ratio with respect to OS in the CD8+ subgroup as compared to the CD8- subgroup was 0.89 within the avelumab arm, 0.62 within the combination arm and 0.88 within the PLD arm. Hazard ratios with respect to OS in the CD8- subgroup were 1.01 and 0.97 for the avelumab arm and the combination arm respectively when compared to the PLD. The hazard ratios in the CD8+ subgroup were 1.03 for the avelumab arm versus the PLD arm, and 0.66 for the combination arm versus the combination arm. Safety Results: An overview of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) is provided in Table 5. The proportions of patients with TEAEs were similar among the treatment arms (96.3%, 98.8% and 97.7% for avelumab, combination treatment and PLD, respectively). However the combination treatment arm had a higher proportion of patients with treatment-related TEAEs, grade 3 TEAEs or TEAEs leading to discontinuation from any study drug. The treatment-emergent serious adverse event (SAE) incidence was higher in avelumab treated patients (avelumab alone [38.0%] and in combination [41.2%]), compared with the PLD arm (28.8%). ./B999_UNBLINDED/B9991009_CSR/adae_s020 Date of Generation: 26JAN2019 (08:53) The TEAE incidences are summarized by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term (PT) and maximum Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade. The incidences of TEAEs with any grade in ≥10% and grade ≥3 in ≥5% patients are presented in Table 6 (all-causality) and Table 7 (treatment-related). More than half of the 533 patients with any TEAEs experienced TEAEs of grade 3 (Table 6). Avelumab treated patients had higher incidences of Grade 5 TEAEs (8.0% and 4.4% compared with 3.4% on PLD), most of which were coded as Disease progression PT. The most frequent all-causality TEAEs in the combination arm (≥30% patients) were Fatigue, Nausea, Anaemia and Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (Table 6). The most frequent treatment-related TEAEs in the combination arm (≥30% patients) were Fatigue, Nausea, and Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (Table 7). Neutropenia 1 (0.5) 1 (0.5) 26 (14.3) 10 (5.5) 26 (14.7) 9 (5.1)   A summary for all-grade and grade 3 immune-related AE (irAE) incidences are presented in Table 8. As expected based on avelumab’s mechanism of action, the proportion of patients with irAEs was higher in the avelumab arm and in the combination arm than in the PLD arm (13.4% and 28.0% versus 4.5% for all grades, 3.7% and 8.2% versus 0.6% for grade 3). The most common irAE categories were “Immune-related Endocrinopathies: Thyroid Disorders” (5.9%, 9.9% and 1.1% in the avelumab arm, the combination arm and the PLD arm, respectively) and “Immune-related Rash” (3.2%, 18.1% and 3.4% in the avelumab arm, the combination arm and the PLD arm, respectively). Alanine aminotransferase increased 2 (1.1) 1 (0.5) 1 (0.5) 1 (0.5) 0 0  A summary for infusion-related reactions (IRR) incidences are presented in Table 9. There were 38 (20.3%), 30 (16.5%) and 17 (9.6%) patients that experienced a TEAE that met the case definition of an IRR in the avelumab, combination and PLD arms, respectively. The most commonly reported IRR PT was Infusion related reaction, experienced by 13 (7.0%) patients in the avelumab arm, 11 (6.0%) patients in the combination arm and 14 (7.9%) patients in the PLD arm. There was a higher proportion of patients in the combination arm with TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of either study drug compared with avelumab and PLD (26.4% versus 10.2% and 10.2%, respectively). The proportion of patients who discontinued both study drugs was similar across treatment arms (8.2% versus 10.2% and 10.2% patients, respectively). The most common TEAE leading to the discontinuation of avelumab was Intestinal obstruction (1.6% and 0.5% patients on avelumab and on the combination treatment, respectively). The most common TEAE leading to the discontinuation of PLD was Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (4.4% and 1.7% patients in the combination treatment and PLD arms, respectively). As of the data cutoff, 57.8% patients in the avelumab arm, 53.8% patients in the combination arm, and 58.2% patients in the PLD arm had died. The primary reason for death was disease progression (48.7% patients in the avelumab arm, 50.5% patients in the combination arm and 50.8 % patients in the PLD arm). TEAEs leading to death are summarized by system organ class (SOC) and PT in Table 10. The most common serious TEAEs were Intestinal obstruction and Abdominal pain. The most common treatment-related serious TEAE was Pyrexia, reported in the avelumab arm and in the combination arm. Overall, there was a higher proportion of liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in the combination arm. None of the abnormalities met the criteria for a potential Hy’s Law case. The proportions of patients with the QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s Formula (QTcF) >500 msec or QTcF changes from baseline >60 msec were small and similar among the 3 treatment arms. One [1 (0.8%)], 1 (0.6%) and 2 (1.5%) patients, respectively, had a Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)% ≥15 points decrease from baseline to a post baseline value <lower limit of normal (LLN); and 1 (0.8%), 3 (1.9%), and 2 (1.5%) patients, respectively, had a LVEF% ≥10 points decrease from baseline to a post baseline value <LLN. Conclusions:  Avelumab, administered alone or in combination with PLD, was not superior to PLD monotherapy in prolonging PFS (as assessed by BICR) or OS, in the treatment of patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.  The observed ORR based on BICR assessment was higher for avelumab administered in combination with PLD and similar for avelumab alone compared with that for PLD alone.  The results of the analyses for tumor-related efficacy endpoints based on investigator assessment were similar to those based on BICR assessment.  PFS and OS were extended following treatment with avelumab in combination with PLD compared to PLD alone in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 and in those containing CD8+ T-cells, when compared to patients whose tumors did not express these markers. These data, while not conclusive in the context of this study, indicate that PD-L1 expression or the presence of CD8 T-cells have potential as predictive biomarkers for the activity of avelumab in combination with PLD in this patient population.  The observed TTD results, as measured by the abdominal/GI subscale of the EORTC QLQ-OV28 were similar for avelumab, either alone or in combination, compare to PLD alone.  The safety profile of avelumab, administered alone or in combination with PLD, was generally tolerable, manageable, and consistent with the known safety profiles of avelumab and PLD when administered as monotherapies.
