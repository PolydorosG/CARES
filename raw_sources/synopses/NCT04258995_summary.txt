Date of Current Version: 13 May 2021 Date(s) of Previous Report(s): Not Applicable OBJECTIVES Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: Primary and secondary study objectives and endpoints are presented in Table S1. Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 2, open-label study in healthy participants who had received 1 of 6 dose/formulations of GBS6 in the C1091001 study. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Key inclusion criteria are as follows:  Healthy adults (male and female) at enrollment who were determined by medical history, physical examination, and clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in the study.  Participants who were enrolled in the C1091001 study, received GBS6, and completed the 1-month blood draw. Key exclusion criteria are as follows:  Pregnant female participants; breastfeeding female participants; positive urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) at Visit 1 (prior to vaccination); and WOCBP who were, in the opinion of the investigator, sexually active and at risk for pregnancy and fertile men and WOCBP who were unwilling or unable to use effective methods of contraception as outlined in this protocol from the signing of the informed consent until at least 3 months after the last dose of investigational product.  Acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that could increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or could interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study. Chronic medical conditions included human immunodeficiency virus, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (HBV surface antigen positive), and/or hepatitis C virus infection.  History of severe adverse reaction and/or severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any vaccine.  History of microbiologically proven invasive disease caused by GBS.  Previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational GBS vaccine (other than GBS6), or planned receipt during the participant’s participation in the study (through 6-month telephone call). Vaccines Administered: Participants received 1 dose of GBS6 (20 μg), with or without aluminum phosphate (AlPO ) based on the formulation received in the primary C1091001 4 study. GBS6 was administered intramuscularly as a 0.5 mL injection per dose into the deltoid muscle, preferably of the nondominant arm unless medically contraindicated. Immunogenicity Evaluations: Blood samples (approximately 50 mL/visit) for immunogenicity assessments were collected from all participants prior to vaccination and at 1 month after vaccination or approximately 150 mL (an additional optional 100 mL) for those who consented to a larger blood draw at Visit 2. OPA results for the 6 serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V) were determined in all participants for each blood sample at Day 1 and at 1 month after vaccination. Results were reported as OPA titers. Concentrations of for each blood sample at Day 1 and at 1 month after vaccination and reported as IgG concentrations. Safety Evaluations: Local reactions (pain at injection site, erythema/redness, and induration/swelling), systemic events (fever, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain) and the use of antipyretic medication were collected using an e-diary during Days 1 to 14 following vaccination, where Day 1 was the day of vaccination. AEs were reported by the participant. AEs were actively elicited and collected up to 1 month after vaccination, SAEs and MAEs were actively elicited and collected up to 6 months after vaccination. Pregnancy tests had a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL. Pregnancy tests were performed in WOCBP immediately before administration of the vaccine dose. Statistical Methods: Primary Endpoints: For each group, the exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided for the proportion of participants reporting local reactions, systemic events, AEs, SAEs and MAEs. For each group, the number of participants with AEs within 1 month, proportion, and associated exact 2-sided 95% CIs were presented for any AE, each system organ class (SOC) and each preferred term (PT) within each SOC, by vaccine group. For each group, the number of participants with MAEs and SAEs, proportion, and associated exacted 2-sided 95% CIs were presented by SOC and PT. Secondary Endpoints: The descriptive summary statistics were provided for immunogenicity results. GMCs of IgG and GMTs of OPA, at each available time point for each serotype were presented by vaccine group. For each vaccine group, the number of participants with valid assay data, GMCs, and associated 2-sided 95% CI were presented. Empirical reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) of IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs, for 1 month after the vaccination time point were generated separately for each serotype by vaccine group. GMFRs from before vaccination to each selected postvaccination timepoint and associated 2-sided 95% CIs of IgG, and OPA were presented for each serotype by vaccine group. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: The disposition of participants is presented in Table S2. There were 152 participants enrolled in the study, 1 participant consented but was not assigned to the study. All 151 participants assigned to the study were vaccinated, 98.7% of the participants completed the study. A total of 2 participants withdrew from the study due to being lost to follow-up. No participants were withdrawn due to AEs. There were more female participants than male participants (75.5% versus 24.5%). The overall mean age of participants was 36.7 years. The majority of the participants were White (82.8%), and non-Hispanic (93.4%). There were more Black or African American participants in the GBS6 without AlPO group compared to the GBS6 with AlPO group 4 4 (18.7% versus 7.9%), and the overall demographic characteristics of the 2 vaccine groups were similar.

Erythema/redness and induration/swelling were reported less 4 frequently and at similar rates between the 2 formulations of GBS6. Of the participants who reported local reactions in the GBS6 with AlPO group and GBS6 without AlPO group, 4 4 53.9% and 40.0%, respectively, described them as mild and 2.6% and 0 described them as severe. No participant reported any Grade 4 local reactions. The overall duration of all the local reactions were similar between the 2 formulations of GBS6. The maximum duration for pain at the injection site was 14 days in participants who administered GBS6 with AlPO compared to 6 days in those who administered GBS6 4 without AlPO . 4 Overall, the median onset days were the same between the 2 formulations of GBS6 (both with a median of Day 1). Systemic Events: The frequency of participants reporting any systemic event was similar between the 2 formulations of GBS6 (with 45 [59.2%] and 46 [61.3%] participants reporting in the GBS6 with AlPO and without AlPO , respectively). Most systemic events were mild 4 4 or moderate. The overall frequency of severe systemic events was low in both formulations of GBS6 (with 2 [2.6%] and 1 [1.3%] participants reporting in the GBS6 with AlPO and 4 without AlPO , respectively). The most frequently reported systemic events were headache 4 and fatigue in both formulations of GBS6 (with 23 [30.3%] and 31 [41.3%] participants reporting headache in the GBS6 with AlPO group and without AlPO group, respectively 4 4 and 34 [44.7%] and 23 [30.7%] participants reporting fatigue in the GBS6 with AlPO group 4 and without AlPO group, respectively). The frequencies of participants reporting fever, 4 nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and joint pain were similar between the 2 formulations of GBS6 (5% difference). Participants who received GBS6 with AlPO reported more fatigue and 4 muscle pain, while participants who received GBS6 without AlPO reported more headache. 4 The overall reported duration of fever, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue/tiredness, muscle pain and joint pain were similar between the 2 formulations of GBS6. Participants who received GBS6 with AlPO reported a longer median duration of headache (6 days versus 4 1 day). The median duration of any systemic event reported ranged from 1.0 to 6.0 days in participants who received GBS6 with AlPO and from 1.0 to 4.0 days in participants who 4 received GBS6 without AlPO . The median duration of reported antipyretic/pain medication 4 use was of limited duration and was similar between the 2 formulations of GBS6. The median onset days for fever (38.0°C) were later in participants receiving GBS6 with AlPO compared to participants receiving GBS6 without AlPO (Day 5 versus Day 1). The 4 4 onset days for antipyretic/pain medication use ranged from Day 1 to 8 for participants receiving GBS6 with AlPO and ranged from Day 2 to 13 for participants receiving GBS6 4 without AlPO .4 Adverse Events: All AEs are summarized by AE category in Table S7. Overall, the number of AEs was low. There were 1 SAE and 5 severe AEs. There were no AEs assessed as vaccine-related by the investigators. All AEs that were reported through 1 month follow-up after the study vaccination are summarized by AE category in Table S8. Overall, 6.6% of participants and 12.0% of participants reported AEs within 1 month after receiving GBS6 with AlPO and without 4 AlPO , respectively. There was no SAE, severe AE, or vaccine-related AE reported through 4 the 1 month follow-up. During the study, AEs were most commonly reported in the SOC of infections and infestations in both dose formulations of GBS6 (6.6% in GBS6 with AlPO and 10.7% in 4 GBS6 without AlPO ).4 AEs that were reported through 1 month follow-up after the study vaccination were most commonly reported in the SOC of infections and infestations in both dose formulations of GBS6 (2.6% in GBS6 with AlPO and 6.7% in GBS6 without AlPO ). 4 4 Table S7.

No other participants reported any SAEs. Other Significant Adverse Events: MAEs were reported by 11.8% of participants in the GBS6 with AlPO group and 9.3% of participants in the GBS6 without AlPO group. The 4 4 most commonly reported MAEs were the PT “pharyngitis streptococcal” for participants in the GBS6 with AlPO group (2.6%) and upper respiratory tract infection for participants in 4 the GBS6 without AlPO group (2.7%). 4 Pregnancy Reported During the Study: There was 1 pregnancy reported during the study. There were no pregnancy related AEs reported in this study. Conclusion(s): A single booster vaccination of GBS6, administered approximately 2 years after a primary GBS6 dose, to healthy adult participants was safe and well-tolerated, and elicited robust immune responses for each vaccine serotype with both dose formulations. This study demonstrated that a booster vaccination of GBS6 may be of benefit for healthy adults after the primary series. These data are important to inform GBS6 dosing strategies in pregnant women with subsequent pregnancies.
