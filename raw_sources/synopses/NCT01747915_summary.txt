Study Objectives and Endpoints PrimaryEfficacy To demonstrate superior efficacy of pregabalin The primary endpoint was the compared to placebo for treatment of PGTC log-transformed (log ) 28-day seizure rate e seizures as measured by the 28-day seizure for all PGTC seizures collected during the rate. double-blind assessment phase. Results were reported as “percent reduction in seizures” relative to placebo. The 28-day seizure rate was calculated as follows for the double-blind assessment phase: Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints The analysis of the exploratory endpoint “time to experience the same total number of primary generalized clonic-tonic seizures (PGTC) seizures in the double-blind assessment phase observed during the baseline phase for each subject (referred to as ‘Time to Nth Seizure’)” will be analyzed and reported separately. METHODS Study Design: This was a randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 pregabalin doses administered twice-daily (BID) as adjunctive therapy in subjects 5 to 65 years of age with PGTC seizures. The study consisted of 4 phases: an 8-week baseline phase, a 12-week double-blind assessment phase including a 2 week double blind dose escalation phase and a 10 week double blind fixed dose phase) and a 1-week double-blind medication taper phase. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects aged 5 to 65 years inclusive with a diagnosis of epilepsy with classified as PGTC seizures according to the International League against Epilepsy, receiving a stable dose of 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Subjects with a current diagnosis of febrile seizures or seizures classified as focal seizures or taking any concomitant medications that were not permitted. Study Treatment: Fixed dose of pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day (300 mg/day maximum), pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day (600 mg/day maximum), or placebo administered BID. treatment phase of this study is presented in Table S2. Table S2. Double-Blind Dosing by Study Treatment and Study Phase Yrs=yearsEfficacy Evaluations: Efficacy was evaluated based on seizure counts at baseline and during the 12-week double blind assessment phase from the subject daily seizure diary. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), laboratory safety tests, physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, body weight, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and suicidality assessments. Statistical Methods: The efficacy analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which consisted of randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of investigational product during the double blind assessment phase and had a baseline value and at least 1 post baseline efficacy assessment (diary entry). The primary analysis set for safety was the safety population, which included randomized subjects who took at least one dose of the investigational product. A total of 168 subjects was planned to be enrolled in this study in a 1:1:1 ratio of pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day (maximum 300 mg/day), pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day (maximum 600 mg/day), and placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the log-transformed (log ) 28-day seizure e rate for all PGTC seizures collected during the double-blind assessment phase. The 28-day seizure rate was calculated as follows for the double-blind assessment phase: # of seizures in the double-blind assessment phase of study 28-day seizure rate =  28 [# of days in period - # of missing diary days in period] When the log-transformation was used, the quantity “1” was added to the 28-day seizure rate to account for any possible "0" seizure incidence. This resulted in the following primary efficacy endpoint: log (28-day seizure rate + 1). Two back-transformations were used for e relative reduction in seizures. The primary analysis was performed using a linear model with log-transformed baseline seizure rate (continuous covariate), age stratum, geographic region, and treatment group as fixed effect terms. Each dose of pregabalin was compared to placebo in a pair-wise manner using a sequential step-wise testing procedure to control for multiplicity of testing such that the experiment-wise type I error rate did not exceed the 5% level of significance. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Table S3. Subject Evaluation Groups The Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population consists of randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of investigational product during the DB assessment phase, have a baseline value and at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment. Number of Subjects Analyzed for Adverse events is the number of subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and with at least one AE page. Number of Subjects Analyzed for Laboratory data is the number of subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and with at least one laboratory test during study treatment. a. Includes 6 subjects that were re-screened, therefore 374 unique subjects were screened. Across treatment groups in the overall population, demographic characteristics were comparable. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 25.2 (13.1) years. Most (121/219 [55.3%]) subjects were female, and 98/219 (44.7%) subjects were male. The majority (196 [89.5%]) of subjects were White, with 22 (10.0%) Asian subjects and 1 (0.5%) subject of other race. Efficacy Results: Primary Endpoint The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, log-transformed 28-day seizure rate, showed a non-significant result for pregabalin 10/mg/kg/day versus placebo (p=0.8889). Since the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group did not meet the primary objective, the primary endpoint analysis for the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group compared to placebo was non- significant per the pre-specified sequential step-wise testing procedure. The difference in least squares (LS) mean in 28-day seizure rate between pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day and placebo was 0.02, and between pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day and placebo was -0.01. The treatment differences reflected a 2.12% change with pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day in PGTC seizure frequency relative to placebo and a -1.23% change with pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day relative to placebo (back-transformation [a]). The treatment differences reflected a 3.10% change in PGTC seizure frequency with pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day and a -1.80% change with pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day (back-transformation [b]). The results of sensitivity and supplemental analyses of the primary endpoint were consistent with those of the primary analysis. Secondary Endpoint Treatment with pregabalin, at both dose levels, did not improve the responder rate numerically compared to placebo. The number of responders was 31 (41.3%) subjects for the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group (p=0.7973 versus placebo), 28 (38.9%) subjects for the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group (p=0.8474 versus placebo), and 30 (41.7%) subjects for the placebo group. Safety Results: The incidence of AEs in any category for each treatment group for the safety analysis set is summarised in Table S4. Table S4.

Except for the Number of Adverse Events subjects are counted only once per treatment in each row. Serious Adverse Events - according to the investigator’s assessment. Severity counts are based on the maximum severity or grade of events. All treated subjects are considered evaluable for adverse events. In the overall population, the most frequently reported AEs (reported in at least 10% of subjects) were as follows: for pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day, dizziness (13 [17.3%] subjects); for pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group, dizziness (12 [16.7%] subjects) and headache and somnolence (11 [15.3%] subjects each); and for placebo, headache (12 [16.7%]). In subjects 5 to 16 years of age, the most frequently reported AEs (reported in at least 10% of subjects) in the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group were dizziness (4 [15.4%] subjects) and upper respiratory tract infection (3 [11.5%] subjects). No AEs occurred in at least 10% of subjects aged 5 to 16 years within the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group, with the incidence of headache, somnolence, upper respiratory tract infection, and weight increased reported in 2 (9.1%) subjects each. Upper respiratory tract infection and increased appetite were the most frequently reported AEs (at least 10% of subjects) in subjects aged 5 to 16 years in the In subjects 17 to 65 years of age, the most frequently reported AEs (reported in at least 10% of subjects were as follows: for pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day, dizziness (9 [18.4%] subjects) and headache (6 [12.2%] subjects); for the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group, dizziness (11 [22.0%] subjects), headache and somnolence (9 [18.0%] subjects each), and weight increased (5 [10.0%] subjects); for the placebo group, headache (11 [20.4%] subjects) and somnolence (6 [11.1%] subjects). One subject in the placebo group discontinued the study due to death from sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which the investigator considered not related to study treatment. One additional subject in the placebo group discontinued the study due to pregnancy. An additional 15 subjects discontinued the study due to an AE (8 subjects in the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group, 5 subjects in the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group, and 2 subjects in the placebo group). The majority of AEs leading to discontinuation were in the nervous system disorders system organ class (SOC) (12 of 17 subjects in total), of which most were due to a seizure- or epilepsy-related event. A total of 15 subjects 17 to 65 years of age permanently discontinued due to AEs, as did 2 subjects 5 to 16 years of age. In addition to the subject that died, other treatment-emergent serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 6 subjects, 2 in each treatment group; seizure (2 subjects) in the placebo group, status epilepticus and generalised tonic-clonic seizure in the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group, and generalised clonic tonic seizure (2 subjects) in the pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day group. The proportion of subjects with AEs relating to laboratory parameters was low with none severe or considered to be SAEs. In addition, there were no clinically significant findings relating to vital signs, ECGs, physical examination or Tanner stage assessment, neurological examination or mental health risk assessments of suicidal ideation and behavior. Conclusion(s): In this study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjunctive pregabalin administered BID in subjects 5 to 65 years of age with PGTC seizures:  The primary objective was not met with pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day based on statistically non-significant reduction in PGTC seizure frequency compared to placebo.  The primary endpoint analysis for the pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day group compared to placebo was non-significant per the pre-specified sequential step-wise testing procedure.  Pregabalin 5 mg/kg/day and pregabalin 10 mg/kg/day were generally safe and well tolerated and consistent with the well-established safety profile of pregabalin.
