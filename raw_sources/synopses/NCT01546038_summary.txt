Patients who had glasdegib dose reduction were reported as the starting glasdegib dose level received. b. Study treatments refer to glasdegib+backbone chemotherapy. Phase 2 Unfit (Non-intensive) The patient disposition for the Phase 2 Unfit arms is summarized in Table S2. Two (2 [2.4%]) patients in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm completed study treatments. The main reasons for discontinuations from study treatments (glasdegib 100 mg and LDAC for the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm and LDAC for the LDAC alone arm) were insufficient clinical response, adverse events (AEs, regardless of causality) and deaths. Four (4 [4.5%]) and 1 (2.3%) patients completed the study in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm and LDAC alone arm, respectively. Death was the main reason for discontinuations from the study. Table S2.

Twelve (12) patients: 9 patients ≥55 years and 3 patients <55 years, were discontinued study treatments due to transplant. b. Study treatments refer to glasdegib 100 mg+cytarabine/daunorubicin. Refer to the PCD CSR synopsis for the summary of demographic data. Efficacy Results: Phase 1b Overall Survival (OS; Secondary Endpoint): Twenty-one (21 [91.3%]) deaths were reported in Arm A, the estimated median OS was 4.4 (80% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5, 6.6) months. Six (6 [85.7%]) deaths were reported in Arm B, the estimated median OS was 11.5 (80% CI: 4.5, 17.4) months. Twelve (12 [54.5%]) deaths were reported in Arm C, the estimated median OS was 37.8 months. The lower bound of 80% CI was 14.5 months and the upper bound of 80% CI was not estimable, as 10 (45.5%) patients were censored for no longer being followed for survival. Phase 2 Unfit (Non-intensive) All the p-values reported in the supplemental CSR were 1-sided unless specified otherwise. OS (Primary Endpoint): In the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm, 80 (90.9%) deaths were reported, and the estimated median OS was 8.8 (80% CI: 6.9, 9.9) months. In the LDAC alone arm, 41 (93.2%) deaths were reported, and the estimated median OS was 4.9 (80% CI: 3.5, 6.0) months (Table S4). The difference in OS was statistically significant and clinically meaningful with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.569 (80% CI: 0.441, 0.734) (by stratified Cox proportional hazards model based on Interactive Voice Response System [IVRS]) and p-value of 0.0020 (by stratified log-rank test based on IVRS). Patients with good/intermediate cytogenetic risk in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm had statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS as compared to those with good/intermediate cytogenetic risk in the LDAC alone arm (based on IVRS: HR=0.526, p-value=0.0063; based on case report form [CRF]: HR=0.514, p-value=0.0042; based on unstratified Cox proportional hazards model). For patients with poor cytogenetic risk, there was an improvement in OS for the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm compared to the LDAC alone arm (based on IVRS: HR=0.631, p-value=0.0624; based on CRF: HR=0.613, p-value=0.0570; based on unstratified Cox proportional hazards model).

Complete Remission (CR; Secondary Endpoint): In the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm, 16 (18.2% [80% CI: 12.9%, 23.5%]) patients achieved CR based on derived response. In the LDAC alone arm, 1 (2.3% [80% CI: 0.0%, 5.2%]) patient achieved CR based on derived response. The difference in CR rate between the 2 arms was statistically significant and clinically meaningful based on derived responses (p-values <0.025 from both unstratified Pearson Chi-Square test [p-value was 2-sided] and stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] test based on IVRS or CRF, respectively). Disease Specific Efficacy Secondary Endpoints: AML: In the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm, 4 (5.1% [80% CI: 2.3%, 10.0%]), 2 (2.6% [80% CI: 0.7%, 6.7%]), 5 (6.4% [80% CI: 3.2%, 11.6%]), 1 (1.3% [80% CI: 0.1%, 4.9%]), 5 (6.4% [80% CI: 3.2%, 11.6%]) and 13 (16.7% [80% CI: 11.3%, 23.4%]) AML patients achieved objective responses of CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi], Morphologic Leukemia-Free State [MLFS], partial remission [PR], PR with incomplete responses; 9 (11.5% [80% CI: 7.1%, 17.6%]) and 13 (16.7% [80% CI: 11.3%, 23.4%]) AML patients achieved cytogenetic complete response (CRc) and molecular complete response (CRm), respectively, based on investigator-reported responses. In the LDAC alone arm, 1 (2.6% [80% CI: 0.3%, 9.9%]), 1 (2.6% [80% CI: 0.3%, 9.9%]), 4 (10.5% [80% CI: 4.7%, 19.9%]) and 8 (21.1% [80% CI: 12.7%, 31.9%]) AML patients achieved objective responses of CRi, PR, MR and SD, respectively, based on derived responses; 1 (2.6% [80% CI: 0.3%, 9.9%]) AML patient achieved CRm, based on investigator-reported response. MDS: In the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm, 1 (10.0% [80% CI: 1.0%, 33.7%]) MDS patient each achieved objective responses of CRi, unconfirmed CRi, marrow complete response (mCR; CRi not included) and unconfirmed SD based on derived responses; 1 (10.0% [80% CI: 1.0%, 33.7%]) MDS patient achieved CRc, based on investigator-reported response. In the LDAC alone arm, 2 (33.3% [80% CI: 9.3%, 66.7%]) MDS patients achieved SD based on derived responses. Phase 2 Fit (Intensive) CR (Primary Endpoint): In the Phase 2 Fit arm, for patients with age ≥55 years, 22 (36.7% [80% CI: 28.7%, 44.6%]) patients achieved CR based on derived response. OS (Secondary Endpoint): In the Phase 2 Fit arm, for patients with age ≥55 years, 42 (70.0%) deaths were reported, and the estimated median OS was 14.7 (80% CI: 13.1, 17.7) months. The estimated median OS regardless of age was 14.9 (80% CI: 13.4, 19.3) months for this arm. Safety Results: Phase 1b Two (2) additional deaths were reported during the follow-up period in Arm C since PCD CSR data cutoff (01 June 2016) for Phase 1b. The safety profile of glasdegib combined with chemotherapy (LDAC [Arm A], decitabine [Arm B], or cytarabine/daunorubicin [Arm C]) for patients in Phase 1b was tolerable and manageable and in line with the safety conclusions drawn from safety data up to PCD. Phase 2 Unfit (Non-intensive) Glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC Arm: The most frequently reported all-causality AEs (≥30%) in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm were anaemia (38 [45.2%] patients), febrile neutropenia and nausea (30 [35.7%] patients each), decreased appetite (29 [34.5%] patients), fatigue (27 [32.1%] patients) and thrombocytopenia (26 [31.0%] patients). The most frequently reported Grade 3 or higher all-causality AEs (≥30%) were anaemia (35 [41.7%] patients), febrile neutropenia (30 [35.7%] patients), and thrombocytopenia (26 [31.0%] patients). The most frequently reported all-causality serious adverse events (SAEs; ≥15%) were febrile neutropenia (24 [28.6%] patients) and pneumonia (19 [22.6%] patients), and treatment-related SAEs (≥4%) were febrile neutropenia (10 [11.9%] patients), anaemia and pneumonia (4 [4.8%] patients each). LDAC Alone Arm: The most frequently reported all-causality AE (≥30%) in the LDAC alone arm was anaemia (17 [41.5%] patients). The most frequently reported Grade 3 or higher all-causality AE (≥30%) was anaemia (15 [36.6%] patients). The most frequently reported all-causality SAEs (≥15%) were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. The most frequently reported treatment-related SAE (≥4%) was febrile neutropenia. SAEs of febrile neutropenia (28.6% versus 17.1%) and pneumonia (22.6% versus 17.1%) were more frequent in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm than in the LDAC alone arm. In contrast, SAEs of sepsis (3.6% versus 12.2%) were less frequently reported for the glasdegib+LDAC arm versus the LDAC alone arm. Smoothened (SMO) inhibitor-associated AEs in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm included dysgeusia (25.0%), muscle spasms (22.6%) and alopecia (10.7%). Seventy-six (76 [90.5%]) and 40 (97.6%) deaths were reported in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC and LDAC alone arms respectively, with the main cause being disease under study. Over half of the deaths occurred during the follow-up period (after 28 days post the last dose of study treatments): 50 out of 76 and 23 out of 40 deaths in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC and LDAC alone arms, respectively. Thirty-two (32 [38.1%]) and 19 (46.3%) patients permanently discontinued study treatments (glasdegib and/or LDAC for the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm and LDAC for the LDAC alone arm) due to AEs in the 2 arms, respectively. Thirty-one (31 [36.9%]) and 13 (31.7%) patients were reported to have AEs that led to temporary discontinuation of LDAC in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC and LDAC alone arms, respectively. Forty-seven (47 [56.0%]) and 15 (17.9%) patients were reported to have AEs that led to temporary discontinuation and dose reduction of glasdegib respectively in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm. Instances of mean QTc using Fridericia’s formula (mQTcF) >480 msec and/or >60 msec increase from baseline were observed in both the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm as well as the LDAC alone arm, suggesting that there may be other confounding factors contributing to QTc changes in both arms. QTcF prolongation >500 msec was less frequent in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm than in the LDAC alone arm (6.0% versus 11.8%). Events on both arms occurred in patients with multiple comorbidities, including significant cardiovascular medical history, and/or patients taking concomitant therapy with QT prolonging potential. Phase 2 Fit (Intensive) Five (5) additional deaths with 4 in the ≥55 years age group were reported during follow-up period since PCD CSR cutoff (03 January 2017) for Phase 2 Fit. The safety profile of glasdegib combined with cytarabine/daunorubicin for patients in the Phase 2 Fit arm was tolerable and manageable and in line with the results based on safety data up to PCD. Conclusions: Refer to the PCD CSR synopsis for the conclusions based on data up to PCD. Based on data up to the last patient last visit, the following conclusions are provided. Phase 1b - AML and MDS • The median OS for glasdegib+cytarabine/daunorubicin (Arm C) was 37.8 (80% CI: 14.5, Not Estimable) months, which appeared favorable in the context of approximately 24 months observed in historical controls. The median OS for glasdegib in combination with LDAC (Arm A) and decitabine (Arm B) was 4.4 (80% CI: 2.5, 6.6) and 11.5 (80% CI: 4.5, 17.4) months, respectively. • The safety profile of glasdegib combined with chemotherapy (LDAC, decitabine, or cytarabine/daunorubicin) for fit (Arm C) and unfit (Arms A and B) patients was consistent with what was seen in the Phase 1 monotherapy study in patients with selected myeloid malignancies, backbone chemotherapy and the known safety profile of SMO inhibitors. Phase 2 Unfit (Non-intensive) - AML and MDS • The primary objective of OS was met at the PCD. The analysis of OS presented in this supplemental CSR was consistent with that at the PCD. Addition of glasdegib to LDAC demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful OS improvement: OS HR of 0.569 (80% CI: 0.441, 0.734) with p-value of 0.0020, indicating 43.1% reduction in risk of death for the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm compared to the LDAC alone arm. The median OS was 8.8 (80% CI: 6.9, 9.9) months versus 4.9 (80% CI: 3.5, 6.0) months, respectively. In terms of HR, improvement in OS was consistent across all pre-specified subgroups by cytogenetic risk. • Based on derived response, a higher CR rate was achieved for the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm (18.2% [80% CI: 12.9%, 23.5%]) versus the LDAC alone arm (2.3% [80% CI: 0.0%, 5.2%]). • Among AML patients, 27 (34.6% [80% CI: 27.7%, 41.5%]) and 3 (7.9% [80% CI: 2.3%, 13.5%]) patients achieved clinically beneficial response (CR, CRi, MLFS, PR, or PRi) in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC and LDAC alone arms, respectively, based on derived responses. Based on investigator-reported responses, 9 (11.5% [80% CI: 7.1%, 17.6%]) and 13 (16.7% [80% CI: 11.3%, 23.4%]) AML patients achieved CRc and CRm, respectively in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm; and 1 (2.6% [80% CI: 0.3%, 9.9%]) AML patient achieved CRm in the LDAC alone arm. • Among MDS patients, 5 (50.0% [80% CI: 29.7%, 70.3%]) and 2 (33.3% [80% CI: 8.7%, 58.0%]) patients achieved clinically beneficial response (confirmed and unconfirmed CR, CRi, mCR, PR, or SD) in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC and LDAC alone arms, respectively, based on derived responses. Based on investigator-reported response, 1 (10.0% [80% CI: 1.0%, 33.7%]) MDS patient achieved CRc in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm. • Glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC treatment was associated with an approximately 3 times longer mean duration of treatment than LDAC alone. The safety/tolerability profile was as expected of a SMO inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy in these patient populations, namely gastrointestinal side effects and cytopenias. • Despite longer duration of glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC treatment, cytopenias were not accompanied by increases in sepsis or bleeding as compared to LDAC alone. • Instances of mQTcF >480 msec and/or >60 msec increase from baseline were observed in both the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm as well as the LDAC alone arm, suggesting that there may be other confounding factors contributing to QTc changes in both arms. QTcF prolongation >500 msec was less frequent in the glasdegib 100 mg+LDAC arm than in the LDAC alone arm (6.0% versus 11.8%). Events occurred in both arms in patients with multiple comorbidities, including significant cardiovascular medical history and/or patients taking concomitant therapy with QT prolonging potential. • Addition of glasdegib to LDAC had a favorable benefit/risk profile for patients with AML or high-risk MDS that are not suitable for intensive chemotherapy. Phase 2 Fit (Intensive) - AML and MDS • Based on derived response for AML and MDS patients, 22 (36.7% [80% CI: 28.7%, 44.6%]) patients with age ≥55 years achieved CR. The response rates were similar to those reported historically for that patient population although the primary objective of demonstrating a ≥54% CR rate was not achieved. • For patients with age ≥55 years, the estimated median OS was 14.7 (80% CI: 13.1, 17.7) months. The estimated median OS regardless of age was 14.9 (80% CI: 13.4, glasdegib in combination with cytarabine/daunorubicin has the potential to demonstrate improved OS for patients who are suitable to receive intensive chemotherapy. • The combination of glasdegib with cytarabine/daunorubicin was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that in AML and MDS patients receiving standard intensive chemotherapy and with what has been reported for the SMO inhibitor class.
