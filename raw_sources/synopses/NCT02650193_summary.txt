COMPOUND NUMBER: PF-06881894 (HSP-130) PROTOCOL NO.: C1221002 (ZIN-130-1504) PROTOCOL TITLE: A Phase 1-2 Ascending Dose Study to Assess the Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, and Safety of PF-06881894 (HSP-130) in Subjects With Non-Metastatic Breast Cancer Following Single-Dose and Multiple-Dose Administration by Subcutaneous Injection. Study Center(s): The study was conducted at 10 sites (3 sites in Hungary and 7 sites in Spain). Three of the sites in Spain received study drug but did not enroll subjects. Study Initiation Date and Final Completion Dates: 21 December 2015 to 05 October 2017 Phase of Development: Phase 1-2 Study Objective(s): Primary Objective for Phase 1 (Cycle 0)  To characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) response of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and CD34+ count to PF-06881894 at doses of 3 mg and 6 mg when administered as a single subcutaneous (SC) dose without chemotherapy to determine whether it would be appropriate to study multiple doses of 3 mg in the context of background chemotherapy. Secondary Objectives for Phase 1 (Cycle 0)  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-06881894 at doses of 3 mg and 6 mg when administered as a single SC dose without background chemotherapy;  To characterize the safety of PF-06881894 at doses of 3 mg and 6 mg when administered as a single SC dose without background chemotherapy. Primary Objective for Phase 2 (Cycles 1-4)  To characterize the PD response of duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in Cycle 1 to PF-06881894 over a range of doses when administered as a single SC dose.  To characterize the PD response of ANC to PF-06881894 in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 over a range of doses when administered as single and multiple SC doses;  To characterize the PK of PF-06881894 in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 over a range of doses when administered as single and multiple SC doses;  To characterize the safety, including immunogenicity, of PF-06881894 over a range of doses when administered as single and multiple SC doses. METHODS Study Design: This was an open-label, non-comparative, parallel-group study characterizing the PD, PK, and safety (including immunogenicity) of PF-06881894 in patients with non-distantly metastatic (non-Stage 4) breast cancer who have not previously received chemotherapy at any point prior to enrollment in this study. The study was originally designed as a dose-finding study supporting 351(a) submission. As the Sponsor transitioned from 351(a) pathway to 351(k) (biosimilar) pathway, the purpose of the study changed from dose-finding to provision of supportive data only in patients with breast cancer for biosimilar submission. The data presented are from the 2 phases of the study in patients with non-distantly metastatic breast cancer and provide PD, PK and safety (including immunogenicity) data. Each phase consisted of an independent study population. Phase 1 (Cycle 0) consisted of a single dose of PF-06881984 (3 mg or 6 mg) to be administered by SC injection in patients prior to definitive breast surgery and without chemotherapy; Phase 2 (Cycles 1-4) consisted of multiple-dose administration of PF-06881984 as a 6 mg SC dose (once per cycle on Day 2 for 4 sequential cycles) in patients after definitive breast surgery, treated with docetaxel, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) chemotherapy. See Figure 1 and accompanying text for an explanation of the 2 phases of the study, Cycle 0 (without chemotherapy) and Cycles 1-4 (with myelosuppressive chemotherapy). Patients enrolled in this study will hereafter be denoted ‘subjects’. Subjects in Phase 1 (Cycle 0) Subject eligibility was determined during a 14-day screening period. Eligible subjects were enrolled sequentially to each of the PF-06881894 dose groups as follows:  Regimen A: PF-06881894, 3 mg, single SC injection in the deltoid region (n = 6);  Regimen B: PF-06881894, 6 mg, single SC injection in the deltoid region (n = 6). Dose escalation from Regimen A to B was based on safety assessments in the 6 evaluable count and platelets), electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, and any adverse events (AEs) occurring postdose administration through Day 30. Based on these assessments, there was no contraindication for dose escalation and screening for the subsequent dose level (Regimen B) was initiated. In Cycle 0, subjects received PF-06881894 on Day 1. Subjects obtained a baseline assessment of ANC and CD34+ count on Day 1 prior to receipt of PF-06881894, and returned for PD (ANC and CD34+) and PK assessments for up to a maximum of 7 visits after PF-06881894 dosing. Subjects in Phase 2 (Cycles 1-4) After completion of enrollment of the 6 subjects receiving Regimen B in Cycle 0, an additional 12 subjects at the 6 mg dose were planned for enrollment on Regimen B in Cycles 1-4. Based on the study design, if the results of Cycle 0 determined that the 3 mg and 6 mg doses appeared comparable, both doses would have been included for assessment in Cycles 1-4. If, however, the results were not comparable and the 3 mg dose response appeared to be lower than the 6 mg dose in terms of ANC and CD34+ counts (and therefore potentially sub-therapeutic in the setting of myelosuppressive chemotherapy), the adaptive design allowed only the 6 mg dose to be assessed in Cycles 1-4. A total of 13 subjects were actually enrolled in Cycles 1-4, as the last 2 subjects were screened at the same time and both met the entry criteria. As the 3 mg dose and 6 mg doses were not comparable in terms of the 2 PD parameters, only the 6 mg dose (Regimen B) was assessed in Cycles 1-4.  Regimen B: PF-06881894, 6 mg, single SC injection in the deltoid region, at least 24 hours after administration of chemotherapy (Day 2) in Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and Cycle 4 (n = 13). Subjects returned for PD (ANC) and PK assessments for up to an additional 7 visits after dosing. The adaptive study design is presented in Figure 1. Study activities are presented in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3. Note: PF-06881894 was previously named HSP-130. Table 1.

The study population was limited to women based on the small total population numbers (original maximum of approximately 36 to 48 subjects, with a final expected total study population of 24 subjects [12 in Cycle 0 and 12 in Cycles 1-4]), and the need for adequate homogeneity to inform dose selection for potential Phase 3 superiority and non-inferiority studies. A total of 13 subjects were actually enrolled in Cycles 1-4, as the last 2 subjects were screened at the same time and both met the entry criteria. Diagnosis and Key Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Female subjects ≥18 years of age, with histologically confirmed and documented invasive breast cancer; breast cancer without evidence of distant metastases (non-Stage 4) based on staging work-up; chemotherapy naïve, who have not received chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting and who were candidates for chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting of TAC, as background chemotherapy; and Zubrod (World Health Organization [WHO] or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]) performance status ≤2 were included.

Subjects with chemotherapy other than that included in this study (TAC) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy; or known immunosuppressive agents including chronic oral corticosteroid use, or radiation therapy within 4 weeks of first dose of PF-06881894, prior bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, or malignancy within 5 years were excluded. Subjects with known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (overexpressing breast cancer); known triple negative (estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative and HER2-negative) breast cancer; ≥ Grade 2 underlying neuropathy were not eligible to participate. sepsis, abscesses or opportunistic infections; treatment with systemically active antibiotics within 72 hours before chemotherapy; known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); known sickle cell disease; known severe persistent drug induced myelosuppression; and heart failure (Class III or IV), severe uncontrolled cardiac disease or myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months before the first administration of PF-06881894 were excluded. Subjects with any malignancy other than breast cancer, with exception of adequately treated squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ, within 5 years before the first administration of the PF-06881894 were not to be included in the study. Study Treatment: Cycle 0: Each eligible subject received 1 dose of PF-06881894 as either 3 mg (Regimen A), or 6 mg (Regiment B) as a SC injection on Day 1. Cycles 1-4: Each eligible subject received a 6 mg dose of PF-06881894 (Regimen B) as SC injections on Day 2 of each treatment period in Cycles 1-4, at least 24 hours after administration of chemotherapy. Efficacy Evaluation: While ANC parameters were assessed in order to determine DSN in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4, there were no statistically evaluable efficacy determinations conducted in this study. Pharmacodynamic Evaluations: Pharmacodynamic Evaluations in Phase 1 (Cycle 0) Blood samples for ANC (2.7 mL) and CD34+ count (2.0 mL) were collected by venipuncture into evacuated collection tubes within 1 hour prior to dose administration on Day 1 and at 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, and 312 hours postdose. The total number of samples planned for PD analysis (ANC and CD34+ count) in Cycle 0 was 7, resulting in approximately 32.9 mL of blood volume. The PD endpoints in Cycle 0 were based on the following variables:  Primary variable: Area under the effect curve for ANC (AUEC ). ANC  Secondary variables: Maximum effect for ANC (ANC_E ), time of maximum effect for max ANC (ANC_T ), area under the effect curve for CD34+ (AUEC +), maximum effect max CD34 for CD34+ count (CD34+_E ), time of maximum effect for CD34+ count (CD34+_T ), max max area under the effect curve for ANC from zero to infinity (AUEC ), and area under ANCinf the effect curve from zero to infinity for CD34+ (AUEC + ) CD34 inf Blood samples for ANC (2.7 mL) were collected by venipuncture into evacuated collection tubes within 1 hour prior to dose administration on Day 2 of the chemotherapy cycle and at 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, and 312 hours postdose. This sample collection schedule only applied to Cycles 1 and 4 with PF-06881894 treatment groups. The total number of samples planned for PD analysis (ANC) in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 was 14, resulting in approximately 37.8 mL of blood volume. DSN was selected as the PD parameter for the Cycles 1-4 phase of the study to help characterize the effect of PF-06881894 in decreasing the neutropenic effect of myelosuppressive chemotherapy. DSN was defined as the number of days with assessments of grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 109/L). The PD endpoints in the Cycles 1-4 phase of the study were based on the following variables:  Primary variable: DSN in Cycle 1.  Secondary variables: DSN in Cycle 4; ANC nadir concentration; time of nadir concentration; area under the effect curve (AUEC); AUEC ; incidence of febrile ANCinf neutropenia, defined as tympanic or axillary body temperature >38.5°C for >1 hour with ANC <1.0x109/L; incidence of severe neutropenia (grade 4, ANC <0.5 × 109/L); and time to ANC recovery (the first day with ANC ≥2.0 × 109/L after any day with ANC <2.0 × 109/L) in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4.  ANC_E and ANC_T will also be provided as additional PD parameters for Cycle 1 max max and Cycle 4. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Pharmacokinetic Evaluations in Phase 1 (Cycle 0) Blood samples for PK assay (7.0 mL) were collected by venipuncture into evacuated collection tubes within 1 hour prior to dose administration on Day 1 and at 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, and 312 hours postdose. The total number of samples planned for PK assay in Cycle 0 was 10, resulting in approximately 70 mL of blood volume. The PK endpoints in Cycle 0 were based on the following variables:  Primary variables: Area under the serum pegylated filgrastim versus time curve from time zero to time infinity (AUC ), and the maximum observed serum pegylated inf filgrastim concentration (C ). max  Secondary variables: Area under the serum pegylated filgrastim versus time curve from time zero to time of last measurable concentration (AUC ); the time to maximum serum t pegylated filgrastim concentration (T ); elimination half-life (t ); elimination rate max ½ constant ( ); and apparent clearance (CL/F). z on interactions with the health authorities, these were added as supplementary endpoints. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations in Phase 2 (Cycles 1-4) Blood samples for PK assay (7.0 mL) were collected by venipuncture into evacuated collection tubes within 1 hour prior to dose administration on Day 2 of the chemotherapy cycle and at 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, 192, 240, and 312 hours postdose. This sample collection schedule only applied to Cycles 1 and 4 with PF-06881894 treatment groups. The total number of samples planned for PK assay in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 was 20, resulting in approximately 140 mL of blood volume.

Safety Evaluations: The safety variables included AEs, including AEs of Special Interest (AESI); laboratory tests; vital signs; 12-lead ECG; physical examination; and immunogenicity assessments. Statistical Methods: Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetics Analysis Method For a particular parameter (AUC , C , ANC_E , ANC_T , AUEC +, CD34+_E , t max max max CD34 max CD34+_T , AUC , t , z, CL/F, and AUEC ) within a particular cohort/cycle, only max inf ½ ANC those subjects who had sufficient data in the cycle to calculate the parameter were included. Sufficient data was defined as having more than 3 measurable values where the parameter could be reliably calculated. PD and PK variables are listed with indicator variables for anti-drug antibody test results (before and after dosing for each cycle). PD and PK variables were summarized for 2 populations: (1) Full analysis set (FAS) and (2) FAS, excluding subjects who had confirmed positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody tests. Data for subjects with positive anti-pegfilgrastim antibody test results and positive anti-polyethylene glycol (PEG) antibody test results are listed. PD and PK parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods in Phoenix WinNonlin Version 6.4 and summarized with descriptive statistics: number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation, median, minimum, and maximum. Additionally, serum concentration data were summarized using descriptive statistics. All subjects who received at least 1 dose of PF-06881894 were included in the safety population. All safety analyses were conducted on the safety population. Safety endpoints included AEs (including AESI), serious AEs (SAEs), laboratory variables, vital signs, physical examination, ECGs, concomitant medication use, discontinuations from the study, exposure to study medication, and anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies. AESIs were defined prospectively based on the safety information of the United States (US)- and European Union (EU)-approved Neulasta (pegfilgrastim, Amgen) Package Insert1 and Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC),2 respectively, and grouped by similar medical constructs. The AESIs are further informed based on the known extension of the pharmacology of the drug as manifested by known clinical adverse reactions with G-CSFs. The following were considered as AESIs for PF-06881894 – Potential Allergic Reactions, Splenomegaly, Splenic rupture, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Alveolar Hemorrhage, Hemoptysis, Leukocytosis, Thrombocytopenia, Capillary Leak Syndrome, Cytokine Release Syndrome, Cutaneous Vasculitis and Glomerulonephritis. To assess the potential role of immunogenicity, AEs were reviewed for injection site reactions and the AESI category of Potential Allergic Reactions, utilizing the narrow standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) queries (SMQs) of Anaphylactic Reactions, Hypersensitivity and Angioedema. AEs, SAEs, concomitant medication use, discontinuations, and treatment exposure were summarized by cohort. Selected cycle-specific data (quantitative laboratory parameters, and vital signs) were summarized by cycle within cohort. Descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) were calculated for quantitative safety data as well as for change from Baseline. For categorical data, counts and frequency of subjects were tabulated. All safety summaries were performed within the safety analysis set. Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition is summarized in Table 4. A total of 25 female subjects were enrolled in the C1221002 study. A total of 12 subjects received a single dose of 3 mg or 6 mg (6 subjects for each dose) of PF-06881894 in Cycle 0; 13 subjects received multiple doses of 6 mg PF-06881894 in Cycles 1-4 (1 dose for each of the 4 cycles). All enrolled subjects completed their respective phase. Table 4.

Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Results Phase 1 (Cycle 0) PD and PK Results: PD (ANC and CD34+) results for the 3 mg and 6 mg cohorts in Cycle 0 are provided in Table 6. ANC (AUEC and E ) response was consistently greater in the 6 mg Cycle 0 max cohort during the high risk period (within the first 5-7 days after chemotherapy) compared with the response in the 3 mg Cycle 0 cohort. Subjects who received 3 mg of PF-06881894 also had lower CD34+ response than subjects receiving 6 mg of PF-06881894.

For anti-PEG antibody positive subjects, antibody was first observed, with the exception of 1 predose positive subject, at Day 14. All 6 subjects in the 3 mg cohort were positive for anti-PEG antibody, which confounds the ability to assess the effect (if any) of anti-PEG antibody on PD and PK for these subjects. In the 6 mg cohort, the 2 anti-PEG antibody positive subjects had the highest AUEC but the lowest area under the concentration time ANC curve (AUC). The low AUC is more likely due to higher neutrophil mediated clearance rather than an effect of anti-PEG antibody on PK. Table 8.

Phase 1 (Cycle 0) PD and PK Conclusions: Both 3 mg and 6 mg doses demonstrated a neutrophil response consistent with published Neulasta weight-based dosing data. As expected, the PD and PK results for the 3 mg dose tended to be lower than the results for 6 mg of PF-06881894 or Neulasta (published data); as a result, 3 mg was not initiated in Phase 2, Cycles 1-4. The subjects who received 3 mg of PF-06881894 had lower ANC (AUEC and E ) compared to those from the subjects who max received 6 mg of PF-06881894, which can most likely be attributed to the lower PF-06881894 systemic exposures in the subjects receiving the 3 mg dose. Phase 2 (Cycle 1 and Cycle 4) PD and PK Results: The PD response (AUEC and/or AUEC +) of 3 mg and 6 mg PF-06881894 in Cycle 0 ANC CD34 indicated that the 3 mg dose level was likely to be inadequate in the context of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and thus, the 3 mg dose level was not included in the Cycles 1-4 assessment, thus all subjects received 6 mg PF-06881894. to address any potential decrement of PD response, in terms of the DSN from Cycle 1 to Cycle 4. DSN was defined as days with grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 × 109/L). The impact of immunogenicity on PD and PK response were to be assessed, however no ADA (anti-pegfilgrastim or anti-PEG) was observed for any subject at any time point in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4. PD results for Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 are summarized in Table 9. In Cycle 1 and Cycle 4, 5 (38.5%) and 5 (38.5%) subjects, respectively, experienced severe neutropenia. Four of these 5 subjects were the same individual in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4. The mean DSN for both Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 were 0.667, while the PD response tended to be more robust (higher and later nadir, with more rapid recovery) in Cycle 4. Table 9.

Phase 2 (Cycle 1 and Cycle 4) PD and PK Conclusions: In Cycle 1 and Cycle 4, 5 (38.5%) and 5 (38.5%) subjects, respectively, experienced severe neutropenia. The mean DSN was 0.667 days in both Cycle 1 and Cycle 4. The DSN of <1 day is consistent with what has been reported for pegylated filgrastim in the literature. The PD response tended to be more robust (higher and later nadir, with more rapid recovery) in Cycle 4, also consistent with what has been reported for pegylated filgrastim (Neulasta). Due to the neutrophil-mediated clearance of pegfilgrastim and higher ANC response in Cycle 4, the lower AUC and C , and higher CL/F values were observed in max Cycle 4 compared to the corresponding values in Cycle 1. During Cycle 0, a total of 12 subjects received a single dose of 3 mg or 6 mg (6 subjects for each dose) of PF-06881984; and during Cycles 1-4, 13 subjects received multiple doses of 6 mg PF-06881984 (1 dose for each of the 4 cycles). All enrolled subjects completed their respective phase. All-Causality Serious Adverse Events: All-causality serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are summarized in Table 11. No subject reported SAE in Cycle 0. Two (15.4%) subjects had 3 SAEs reported in Cycles 1-4, all of Febrile neutropenia. One subject was hospitalized following chemotherapy treatment in Cycles 1 and 2. The second subject was hospitalized following chemotherapy treatment in Cycle 4. All 3 events of Febrile neutropenia were reported to be resolved and were considered severe and unrelated to PF-06881894, but related to TAC chemotherapy. Table 11.

No subject discontinued the study or study drug due to TEAEs. Deaths: There were no deaths reported during this study. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI): Two (33.3%) subjects had 2 AESIs reported in the 6 mg cohort in Cycle 0; 1 event of Dermatitis contact from the category of Potential Allergic Reactions, and 1 event of Leukocytosis, corresponding to a leukocyte count of 41.94 G/L (reference range: 3.98-10.04 G/L, equivalent to ×109/L) on Day 3, with no associated signs or symptoms. Both AESIs were considered non-serious and mild in severity, and the AESI of Leukocytosis was considered related to PF-06881894. Although all subjects experienced the expected increase in leukocytes, it was reported as an AE for this 1 subject. Two (15.4%) subjects had 3 AESIs reported in the 6 mg Cycles 1-4 cohort. One subject had an event of Face edema from the category of Potential Allergic Reactions. The event was considered non-serious, mild in severity, and not related to PF-06881894. One subject had an event of Platelet count decreased from the category of Thrombocytopenia; there were 2 entries for this event based on transition in severity of this event from severe (first entry) to moderate (second entry). Both entries of Platelet count decrease were considered non-serious and not related to PF-06881894. Immunogenicity: There were no subjects who were confirmed positive for anti-pegfilgrastim antibody at any visit. There were no reported injection site reactions, and there were no AEs assessed as clinical manifestations of immunogenicity regardless of anti-drug antibody status. Vital Signs, ECG, Physical Examination: There were no clinically significant findings for vital signs, ECG abnormalities and physical examination and specifically no splenomegaly reported. Clinical Laboratory Results: The clinical laboratory results and patterns observed were consistent with the known therapeutic response and the safety profile for the US- and EU-approved pegylated filgrastim (Neulasta).1,2 Of note, there was 1 subject with an AE of Thrombocytosis, corresponding to a platelet count of 850 G/L (reference range: 182-369 G/L, equivalent to ×109/L) on Cycle 1 Day 20. The event was considered non-serious and moderate in severity, and related to PF-06881894. The subject was treated with enoxaparin and acetylsalicylic acid, and the event was considered resolved by Cycle 2, Day 6. The subject had no complications related to the elevated platelet count. Cycle 0: Subjects who received 3 mg of PF-06881894 had lower PD (ANC and CD34+) response and tended to have lower systemic PF-06881894 exposures compared to those in the subjects receiving 6 mg of PF-06881894. None of the subjects in Cycle 0 developed anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies. Anti-PEG antibodies were observed in 6 and 2 subjects in the 3 mg and 6 mg cohorts, respectively. Cycles 1-4: Based on the results in Cycle 0, all subjects received 6 mg of PF-06881894. The mean DSN in both Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 was 0.667 days, consistent with what has been reported for pegylated filgrastim in the literature. None of the subjects developed anti-PEG or anti-pegfilgrastim antibodies. Safety: Overall, the occurrence of non-serious TEAEs was similar across the treatment groups. No subjects reported SAEs related to PF-06881894. Overall the safety results were consistent with the known safety profile in patients treated with pegylated filgrastim [Neulasta (pegfilgrastim)], with and without myelosuppressive TAC chemotherapy. There were no immunogenicity concerns identified for PF-06881894 in the studied populations of breast cancer patients with and without chemotherapy.
