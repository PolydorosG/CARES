Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Pharmacogenomic Evaluations: These evaluations were not conducted in this study. Safety Evaluations: Safety was assessed by the spontaneous reporting of AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory results in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the investigational product. The safety endpoints included incidence of treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs), incidence of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation, and incidence of clinical abnormalities and change from baseline in selected clinical laboratory values, ECG measurements, and vital signs. Statistical Methods: Abrocitinib 200 mg QD was declared superior to placebo if the null hypothesis of no difference between abrocitinib 200 mg QD versus placebo for both co- primary endpoints was rejected at the 5% significance level. Similarly, abrocitinib 100 mg QD was declared superior to placebo if the null hypothesis of no difference between abrocitinib 100 mg QD versus placebo for both co-primary endpoints was rejected at the significance level specified below. A sequential Bonferroni-based iterative multiple testing procedure to strongly control the familywise Type 1 error at 5% was used for assessing each of the two abrocitinib doses (200 mg QD and 100 mg QD) versus placebo on the primary and key secondary endpoints. The procedure belongs to a class of consonant multiple test procedures which are a subclass of the closed test procedures. The procedure first assessed the co-primary endpoints (IGA and EASI-75 at Week 12 for 200 mg QD versus placebo) at the 5% level. If this hypothesis was not rejected, then statistical significance was not claimed for any subsequent hypotheses. If this hypothesis was rejected, assessing for statistical significance continued for the co-primary endpoints (IGA and EASI-75 at Week 12) for the 100 mg QD versus placebo comparison. If this hypothesis was not rejected, then no statistical significance was claimed for any subsequent hypotheses. If this hypothesis was rejected, then assessments continued as follows: 1. A series of hypotheses related to the severity of pruritus (NRS4) at Week 2 were assessed at the 2.5% level in the following order (Sequence A): 200 mg abrocitinib versus placebo, 100 mg abrocitinib versus placebo, 200 mg abrocitinib versus dupilumab, 100 mg abrocitinib versus dupilumab. 2. If all hypotheses in Sequence A were rejected, then the unused alpha level of 2.5% was passed on to the assessing for the Week 16 endpoints at a 5% significance level in the following order (Sequence B): IGA, 200 mg abrocitinib versus placebo; EASI-75, 200 mg abrocitinib versus placebo, IGA, 100 mg abrocitinib versus placebo; EASI-75, 100 mg abrocitinib versus placebo. The statistical significance for each hypothesis in Sequence B could not be claimed unless the prior hypothesis in the sequence was statistically significant. In Sequence B, if one hypothesis was not rejected at alpha level of 5% then no statistical significance was claimed for any subsequent hypotheses in the sequence. 3. In Sequence A, if one hypothesis was not rejected at alpha level of 2.5% then no statistical significance was claimed for any subsequent hypotheses in the sequence. In this case, the assessing for statistical significance in Sequence B was at the 2.5% level. If all hypotheses in Sequence B were rejected, then the unused alpha level of 2.5% was passed back for assessing the hypotheses in Sequence A at the 5% level. In Sequence B, if one hypothesis was not rejected at alpha level of 2.5 % then no statistical significance was claimed for any subsequent hypotheses in the sequence. After statistical significance was demonstrated at Week 2, in order to be more rigorous about the onset of relief of severity of pruritus, a step-down approach with the NRS4 endpoint from Week 2 to earlier time points was utilized as an additional family of hypothesis tests. In general, for descriptive analyses, number and percent were presented for binary variables. Number, mean, standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles were presented for continuous variables. Estimates of the pairwise differences along with the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) were provided among the treatment groups, abrocitinib 200 mg QD, abrocitinib 100 mg QD, dupilumab, and placebo. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 1234 subjects were screened, and 838 subjects were randomized. Similar proportions of subjects across the treatment groups were ongoing in the study after completing 16 weeks. Subject discontinuations were low; the most common reasons for discontinuations were withdrawal by subjects (various reasons including personal reasons and lack of efficacy) and AEs (Table S3). Baseline demographic characteristics were balanced across treatment groups; the median age was 34 years. Majority of the subjects were White (72.4%) and non-Hispanic or Latino (83.8%); 21.3% were of Asian descent and 4.2% were Black or African Americans. Randomized subjects were representative of the moderate (64.6%) or severe (35.4%) AD population at baseline per the IGA score; also, the median EASI was 27.2 and median BSA involvement was 45.6%. The baseline PRO values were representative of a high burden of disease and impact on quality of life (QoL). DLQI scores showed that subjects reported their disease had a "very large effect" on their QoL (median: 15.0). POEM scores indicated subjects reported their symptoms were "severe” (median: 22.0). Proportions of subjects who had received prior systemic or topical treatment for AD were similar across treatment groups. Efficacy Results: Co-primary Endpoints: The study met both co-primary endpoints of IGA and EASI-75 responses at Week 12, demonstrating that both abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg treatment groups were superior to the placebo group. Also, responses with abrocitinib 200 mg dose were higher than responses with abrocitinib 100 mg dose (Table S4, Table S5). Additional supportive analyses for both co-primary endpoints were performed using the Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) population and using the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population with a tipping point (TP) analysis where all missing responses were multiply imputed. For both co-primary endpoints, the results of the PPAS and TP analyses were consistent with the FAS primary analysis and conclusions remain unchanged.  Key Secondary Endpoints:  Both abrocitinib groups had statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in all 3 key secondary endpoints (p≤0.0002): proportion of subjects with PP-NRS4 at Week 2, IGA response at Week 16, and EASI-75 at Week 16 (Table S6, Table S7, Table S8).  At Week 2, abrocitinib 200 mg group compared with the dupilumab group, had statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects with PP-NRS4, indicating earlier onset of action (p<0.0001; Table S6).  At Week 16, abrocitinib 200 mg group compared with the dupilumab group, showed higher proportion of IGA responders, based on 95% CI of the treatment difference between the groups (Table S7).  At Week 16, proportion of EASI-75 responders was numerically greater in abrocitinib 200 mg group than in dupilumab group and was numerically lesser in abrocitinib 100 mg group than in dupilumab group; 95% CI for the differences did not support true difference in treatment responses (Table S8). 200 mg QD - 100 mg QD [1] 95% CI (-13.9, 3.7) (-3.1, 14.1) Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Additional secondary efficacy endpoints (IGA, EASI, PP-NRS, BSA, steroid-free days, and SCORAD) demonstrated improved efficacy in both abrocitinib groups compared with the placebo group. The treatment effect of the abrocitinib 200 mg group was consistently higher than the abrocitinib 100 mg group. Abrocitinib consistently had earlier onset of action than dupilumab and over time abrocitinib 200 mg tended to be more effective than dupilumab.  IGA: At Weeks 2, 4, and 8 (also, at Week 12 [co-primary] and Week 16 [key secondary]), both abrocitinib treatment groups showed statistically higher proportions of subjects with IGA responses compared with the placebo group (p≤0.0093). Both abrocitinib groups had greater proportions of IGA responders than the dupilumab group at Week 2, and the 200 mg group had more responders than dupilumab group at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16; these were true treatment differences per 95% CIs.  EASI-75: At Weeks 2, 4, and 8, (also, at Week 12 [co-primary] and Week 16 [key secondary]) both abrocitinib treatment groups, compared with placebo group, showed statistically significantly greater proportions of subjects with EASI-75 responses (p≤0.0006).

Abrocitinib groups generally had earlier onset than dupilumab group.  PtGA: Scores were statistically significantly improved in both abrocitinib groups compared with the placebo group from Week 2 to Week 16; and the abrocitinib 200 mg group showed more improvement than the dupilumab group from Week 2 to Week 12.  DLQI: Scores were statistically significantly improved in both abrocitinib groups compared with the placebo group at Weeks 2, 12, and 16; the 200 mg group showed more improvement than the dupilumab group at Weeks 2, 12, and 16. Also, there were statistically significantly greater proportions of responders (≥4 points improvement from baseline) in both abrocitinib groups than in placebo group.  EQ-5D-5L: Index value was statistically significantly improved for both abrocitinib groups compared with the placebo group at Weeks 12 and 16, and more improved in 200 mg group than dupilumab group at Week 12. The VAS score was improved for abrocitinib 200 mg group compared with the placebo group at Weeks 12 and 16.  HADS: Both abrocitinib groups compared with the placebo group had statistically significant improvement in symptoms associated with depression and anxiety at Weeks  POEM: Scores were statistically significantly improved in both abrocitinib groups compared with the placebo group at Weeks 12, and 16; and the 200 mg group showed more improvement than the dupilumab group at both timepoints.  PSAAD: As early as Week 1, the scores were statistically significantly improved in both abrocitinib groups compared with the placebo group, and improvement was maintained at each weekly timepoint up to Week 16; the 200 mg group showed more improvement than the dupilumab group at Week 1 and maintained it at each weekly timepoint up to Week 10. SAFETY  Abrocitinib was well tolerated. The observed safety events were consistent with those seen in other abrocitinib studies.  A higher proportion of subjects with all-causality TEAEs occurred in the abrocitinib 200 mg group compared with the abrocitinib 100 mg, dupilumab and placebo groups.  All-causality TEAEs that appeared more commonly in the abrocitinib groups relative to the dupilumab or placebo groups included nausea, headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, herpes simplex, blood creatine phosphokinase increased and acne. A higher incidence of conjunctivitis was observed in the dupilumab group compared to either abrocitinib group or placebo.  The incidence of TEAEs related to atopic dermatitis was more frequent in the placebo group compared with either abrocitinib group and the dupilumab group.  The majority of all-causality TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity.  The incidence of severe all-causality TEAEs was low and similar between all treatment groups.  No deaths were reported in the study.  The incidence of SAEs was low and similar across the treatment groups.  Discontinuations from the study due to TEAEs were low and similar across the treatment groups.  The incidence of herpes zoster was low, one subject (1/238 [0.4%]) in the abrocitinib 100 mg QD group had a severe TEAE, and no subjects in the abrocitinib 200 mg group, dupilumab group or placebo group had a severe TEAE.  Platelet counts decreased in a dose-dependent manner in both abrocitinib groups with a abrocitinib administration in the majority of subjects. No changes from baseline were observed for the dupilumab group. No subjects met pre-specified monitoring criteria, and no subject met pre-specified discontinuation criteria. Median lymphocyte counts, neutrophil counts, and hemoglobin values showed no clinically meaningful median changes.  There were increases in both abrocitinib groups for total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, where dose-dependent changes were observed for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. There were no changes over time in LDL/HDL ratio. No meaningful changes were observed in the dupilumab group.  Dose-dependent increases in creatine kinase were observed in the abrocitinib groups compared with the placebo group but were not clinically meaningful. No median changes from baseline creatine kinase values were observed for the dupilumab group. There were no TEAEs of rhabdomyolysis.  Two (2) adjudicated malignancy events (abrocitinib 200 mg group and dupilumab group) occurred in the study. One subject had actinic keratosis (abrocitinib 200 mg group) per histopathology review. None of the subjects had any findings from cardiovascular review or opportunistic infections review.  There was no pattern of concern in ECG, and vital signs and no unexpected laboratory abnormalities were observed.
