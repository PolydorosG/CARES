Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): Approximately 12 healthy male and/or female participants were planned to be randomized into 1 of 2 sequences. A total of 12 participants were assigned to the study. All participants received study intervention and completed the study. Per protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP), all participants were included in the PK and safety analysis sets. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Healthy adult participants were enrolled in this study. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): Each enrolled participant was planned to participate in 2 study periods to receive 2 different treatments according to the sequence determined by randomization:  Treatment A: Single oral dose of PF-07321332 300 mg (2 × 150 mg tablets) under fasted condition and 3 doses of ritonavir 100 mg at -12 hour, 0 hour and 12 hour relative to PF-07321332 dosing (Reference).  Treatment B: Single oral dose of PF-07321332 300 mg (2 × 150 mg tablets) under fed condition and 3 doses of ritonavir 100 mg at -12 hour, 0 hour and 12 hour relative to PF-07321332 dosing (Test).

Study Intervention(s) Administered Investigational Product Vendor Lot Pfizer Lot No. Strength/ Dosage Description No. Potency Form PF-07321332 150 mg tablet FK0781 21-DP-00808 150 mg Tablet (croscarmellose sodium) Duration of Study Intervention: The planned duration of treatment was 1 day each in Periods 1 and 2. Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: There were equal number (6 participants each) of male and female enrolled. Most of the participants were among the age of 18-64 years old with a mean age of 46.92 years old. Most of the participants (83.3%) were non Hispanic or Latino. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) body mass index (BMI) was 24.22 (3.507) kg/m2. Exposure: The duration of treatment was 1 day each in Periods 1 and 2. Safety Results: No participant had a serious adverse event (SAE), severe adverse event (AE), dose reduction or temporary discontinuation due to AEs. All TEAEs were mild in severity. The most frequently reported TEAE was Dysgeusia in both treatment groups, detected in 5 (41.7%) and 3 (25.0%) participants during the fed and fasted treatment periods, respectively. All instances of Dysgeusia were considered treatment related. The numbers of participants with laboratory abnormalities were similar between the fed and fasted treatment groups (0-2 participants in either group). None of the laboratory abnormalities were considered clinically significant. No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs measurements, ECGs or other observations related to safety were observed in this study. Pharmacokinetic Results: Following a single oral dose of PF-07321332 300 mg boosted with 3 doses (every 12 hours, Q12H) of ritonavir 100 mg administered under fed (high-fat and high-calorie meal) or fasted conditions, the rate of absorption of PF-07321332 appeared to be similar between the fed and fasted treatments with geometric mean C values observed in a median T of 2.50 hours max max for the fed treatment compared to 2.29 hours for the fasted treatment. Overall, food had a minimum impact on the systemic exposure of PF-07321332 with an approximately 1.2-fold increase in geometric mean AUC for the fed treatment compared to inf the fasted treatment. Peak exposure was higher in the fed treatment with a 1.6-fold increase in geometric mean C compared to the fasted treatment. The test/reference (fed/fasted) max ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% confidence interval [CI]) for PF-07321332 AUC , and C were 119.67% (108.75%, 131.68%) and 161.01% (139.05%, 186.44%), inf max respectively. Mean terminal t was 7.390 hours for the fed treatment compared to 8.673 hours for the ½ fasted treatment. Mean apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V /F) values were 6.812 L/hr and 68.77 L, respectively, for the fed treatment compared to z 8.148 L/hr and 96.88 L, respectively, for the fasted treatment. Inter-individual variability for PF-07321332 AUC and C geometric means were similar inf max between the fed and fasted treatments. The geometric coefficient of variation (CV%) was 31% for both AUC and C in the fed treatment period and 36% and 44%, respectively, in inf max the fasted treatment period. Conclusions: PK:  Following a single oral dose of PF-07321332 300 mg boosted with 3 doses of (Q12H) ritonavir 100 mg administered under fed (high fat and high calorie meal) or fasted conditions, PF-07321332 plasma exposure for the fed treatment was approximately 1.2- and 1.6-fold higher based on geometric mean AUC and C values, inf max respectively, compared to that observed in the fasted treatment group. The increase in exposure under fed condition is not considered as clinically meaningful. The test/reference (fed/fasted) ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% CI) for PF-07321332 AUC , and C were 119.67% (108.75%, 131.68%) and 161.01% inf max (139.05%, 186.44%), respectively. Safety:  The safety data, including AEs, laboratory abnormalities, vital signs, and ECGs indicate that PF-07321332/ritonavir has an acceptable safety profile in healthy adult participants when administered under both fed and fasted conditions.
