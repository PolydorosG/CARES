SYNOPSIS Study Title: A Phase 1, Open-Label, Single-Dose Study to Investigate the Mass Balance, Metabolism and Excretion of [14C]-PF-07304814 in Healthy Participants Using a 14C-Microtracer Approach Study Number: C4611003 Regulatory Agency or Public Disclosure Identifier Number: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05050682 Study Phase: 1 Name of Study Intervention: PF-07304814 Name of Sponsor/Company: Pfizer Inc. CSR Version and Report Date: Version 1.0, 26 August 2022 Number of Study Center(s) and Investigator(s): A total of 5 participants were enrolled at a single center in the United States A list of the study center and investigators involved in this study is provided in Appendix 16.1.4.1. Publications: None Study Period: Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 07 October 2021 Study Completion (Last Participant Last Visit) Date: 10 December 2021 This study was neither discontinued nor interrupted. Rationale: This open-label, single-dose study in approximately 5 healthy male and female (of non-childbearing potential only) participants has been designed to characterize mass balance and further the understanding of human pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and excretion of PF-07304814 administered at a dose of 500 mg [14C]-PF-07304814 containing approximately [14C]-PF-07304814 as a constant-rate, continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 24 hours. The sample size of approximately 5 was selected to ensure at least 4 fully evaluable participants with completed collections of plasma, urine, and fecal samples. This is a standard sample size used for mass-balance/ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) studies which include assessment of metabolic profiling and is not based on empirical data or hypothesis testing criteria. Objectives, Endpoints, and Statistical Methods: Abbreviations: 14C = carbon 14; AUC = area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to time of last last measurable concentration; AUC = area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity; inf C = maximum observed concentration; C = concentration at the 24-hour timepoint; CL = systemic max 24 clearance; nCi = nanocurie; ECG = electrocardiogram; PK = pharmacokinetic(s); t = terminal phase ½ half-life; TEAE = treatment emergent adverse event; T = time to reach C ; V = steady-state volume max max ss of distribution. Methodology: This was a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, single-center study to characterize mass balance and evaluate the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and route and extent of elimination of [14C]-PF-07304814 in healthy male and female (of non-childbearing potential) participants. The study was planned to enroll approximately 5 healthy participants. Each participant was planned to receive a single, 24-hour constant-rate, continuous IV infusion of 500 mg PF-07304814 containing approximately [14C]-PF-07304814. Healthy participants were screened to determine eligibility within 42 days prior to dosing to confirm that they met the inclusion and not the exclusion criteria. Medical history and results of physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical laboratory evaluations would determine eligibility. Participants were admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day -1 and remained in the CRU until the end of the study through Day 10. On Day 1, each participant received a single, 24-hour, constant rate, continuous IV infusion of 500 mg PF-07304814 containing approximately [14C]-PF-07304814. Serial blood samples were collected at specified times up to 216 hours post the start of the infusion. Total urine collections were made just before dosing (“blank”) and in 24-hour intervals until the end of the study. Feces were collected from Day -1 (“blank”), and at the time of passing while the participant was confined in the clinic. Daily sample collections continued through the morning of discharge. Participants were confined from at least 24 hours prior to dosing on Day 1 until at least the morning of Day 10 (216 hours) post infusion start. Complete physical examinations, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, oral temperature, ECGs, and safety laboratory tests were conducted, and AEs and concomitant medications were monitored throughout the study to assess safety. Before the participant was released, a complete physical examination was conducted along with safety laboratory tests, ECG, BP, heart rate and oral temperature. A safety follow-up call was made to participants 28 to 35 days from administration of the dose of study intervention. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): Approximately 5 participants were planned to be enrolled to receive study intervention. The PK analysis set included concentration analysis sets (for PF-07304814 and for [14C]), mass balance analysis set and PK parameter analysis set.  The PK concentration analysis set for PF-07304814 was defined as all participants who received study intervention and had at least 1 measurable PF-07304814 and PF-00835231 concentration(s).  The PK concentration analysis set for [14C] was defined as all participants who received study intervention and had at least 1 [14C] measurement.  The PK parameter analysis population was defined as all participants randomized and treated who had at least 1 of the parameters of primary interest in plasma, urine or feces.  The mass balance analysis set was defined as all participants who received study intervention and who had evaluable total [14C] concentration (urinary and fecal) data and who had no protocol deviations or AEs (such as diarrhea or severe constipation) that might have affected the mass balance analysis. The safety analysis set was defined as all participants who received at least 1 dose of study A total of 5 participants were enrolled in the study. All participants were treated and included in the safety analysis set and PK analysis sets. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Healthy adult participants were enrolled in the study. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): The study intervention in this study referred to PF-07304814, administered as a single, 24-hour constant-rate, continuous IV infusion of 500 mg containing approximately [14C]-PF-07304814.

Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: All participants were male. The median (range) age was 40.0 (23, 48) years. All participants were not Hispanic or Latino. Exposure: This was a single-dose study, and the exposure to study intervention was 24 hours for all participants. Safety Results: There were 4 all-causality treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 3 participants, of which 2 were considered as treatment-related by the investigator. There was no death, serious adverse events (SAEs) or severe TEAEs during the study. No participant had discontinuation from study or study intervention due to adverse events (AEs). All TEAEs were mild in severity. All TEAEs were reported in the System Organ Classes were single TEAEs of constipation and erythema, both were not considered as treatment-related. There were 2 cases of diarrhoea, both were considered as treatment-related by the investigator. There was single laboratory abnormality reported in the hematology group of activated partial thromboplastin time (seconds) >1.1× upper limit of normal (ULN). No clinically meaningful trends were observed. No clinically meaningful findings in the vital sign measurements, ECGs, or other observations related to safety were observed in this study. There were no vital sign or ECG data meeting the pre-defined criteria. Pharmacokinetic Results: Mass Balance Results The mean (SD [standard deviation]) amount of [14C] recovered in urine and feces, as a percent of the total [14C] dose administered, were 25.2% (3.3%) and 34.0% (4.7%), respectively. The mean (SD) percentage of [14C] relative to the administered dose in excreta (urine + feces) was 59.2% (3.9%).
