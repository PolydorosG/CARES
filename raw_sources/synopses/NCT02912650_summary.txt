COMPOUND NUMBER: PF-06438867 PROTOCOL NO.: B5061003 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Randomized, Safety and Efficacy Study Comparing a Single Oral Dose of Ibuprofen (IBU) 250 mg/Acetaminophen (APAP) 500 mg (Administered as Two Tablets of IBU/APAP 125 mg/250 mg) to Each Active Drug Monocomponent Alone and to Placebo in the Treatment of Post-Surgical Dental Pain Study Center: One (1) center in the United States took part in this study. Study Initiation Date and Final Completion Date: 25 September 2015 to 29 June 2016 Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the analgesic efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of fixed-dose combination (FDC) IBU/APAP 250 mg/500 mg (administered as 2 caplets of IBU/APAP 125 mg/250 mg) compared to IBU 250 mg alone, APAP 650 mg alone, and placebo. METHODS Study Design: This was a 12-hour, 4-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single-center, in-patient study in 568 subjects. Subjects enrolled were healthy males and females aged 18 to 40 years who were experiencing post-operative pain following surgical extraction of 3 or more third molar teeth. Following extraction, subjects rested quietly at the study center until they experienced post-surgical pain of at least moderate severity (on the 4-point categorical scale), confirmed by a Visual Analog Pain Severity Rating (VAS PSR) scale of at least 50 mm on a 100 mm VAS PSR scale. Baseline pain severity was rated using an 11-point numerical pain severity rating (PSR) scale. Upon completion of the baseline scales, eligible subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose of study medication under double-blind conditions and then evaluated on-site for 12 hours following administration of study medication. At 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 hour post-dose time points, subjects provided self-ratings of pain severity using an 11-point numerical PSR scale and a 4-point categorical PSR. Subjects also provided a self-rating of pain relief at each time point using a categorical pain relief rating (PRR) scale. At 12 hours, subjects also completed a Global Evaluation of the study medication. Additionally, subjects evaluated the time to first 12 hours post-dose or until the time of first rescue medication use, whichever was sooner. A review of any reported adverse events (AEs) was also completed. The schedule of activities (Table 1) provides an overview of the protocol visits and procedures. Table 1.

In addition, females of child-bearing potential were given a serum pregnancy test at screening. c Females of child-bearing potential were given a urine pregnancy test on the morning of surgery. d 100 mm VAS PSR: none = 0 to severe = 100. e 4-point Categorical PSR Scale: none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, and severe = 3. Completed at each time point and immediately before rescue medication use (if it occurred before hour 12). Subject must have had a baseline pain score of at least moderate on the 4-point categorical scale, confirmed by at least 50 mm on a 100 mm VAS PSR scale, to be eligible for entry. f 11-point Numerical PSR Scale: none = 0 to 10 = Worst Possible Pain. Completed at each time point and immediately before rescue medication use (if it occurred before hour 12). g 5-point Categorical Pain Relief Rating Scale: none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, and complete = 4. Completed at each time point staring at 15 minutes post-dose and immediately before rescue medication use (if it occurred before hour 12). Table 1. Schedule of Activities h Subject was instructed to stop the first stopwatch “when you first begin to feel any pain relieving effect whatsoever of the drug”. i Subject was instructed to stop the second stopwatch “when you have meaningful relief, that is, when the relief from the pain is meaningful to you”. j 6-point categorical global evaluation score: very poor = 0, poor = 1, fair = 2, good = 3, very good = 4, excellent = 5. Completed at the 12-hour time point or immediately before taking rescue medication. A total of 560 subjects (168 for each active treatment group and 56 for the placebo) were required to complete the study per protocol. Assuming a 5% drop-out rate, a total of approximately 588 subjects were to be enrolled. A total of 722 subjects were screened, out of which 568 subjects were randomized and included in the full analysis and safety sets. Fifty-six (56), 172, 175, and 165 subjects were randomized to placebo, FDC IBU 250 mg/APAP 500 mg, IBU 250 mg, and APAP 650 mg treatment groups, respectively. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Inclusion Criteria: Eligible subjects included healthy males and/or females who were not pregnant or breast feeding, aged 18 to 40 years (inclusive), had undergone surgical extraction of 3 or more third molars (of which at least 2 must have been a partial or complete bony mandibular impaction), and had at least moderate pain on the 4-point categorical scale, confirmed by at least 50 mm on the 100 mm VAS PSR scale within approximately 5 hours after surgery was completed. Exclusion Criteria: Subjects that had the presence or history of any significant hepatic, renal, endocrine, cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, hematologic, or metabolic disorder determined by the investigator to place the subject at increased risk, including the presence or history within 2 years of screening, had acute localized dental alveolar infection at the time of surgery that could have confounded the post-surgical evaluation, or had hypersensitivity to IBU, naproxen, aspirin, or any other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), or to APAP, tramadol, other opioids, or to their combinations were not eligible in this study. Study Treatment: Investigational product was administered to the subject within 7 minutes of the completion of the baseline pain assessments by the third party dispenser. Subjects were stratified by sex and baseline pain (moderate or severe pain as determined by their baseline categorical pain severity scores), and received 1 of the following study medications under randomized, double-blind conditions in a 1:3:3:3 ratio with approximately 6 to 8 ounces of room temperature water:  Placebo (administered as 2 tablets)  FDC IBU 250 mg/APAP 500 mg (administered as 2 caplets of IBU 125 mg/APAP 250 mg)  IBU 250 mg (administered as 2 caplets of 125 mg)  APAP 650 mg (administered as 2 tablets of 325 mg) Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  SPID[11]0-8 (time-weighted sum of Pain Intensity Difference [PID] scores PID[11] based on the 11-point Numerical PSR) from 0 to 8 hours. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  SPID[11]6-8 (time-weighted sum of PID[11] based on the 11-point Numerical PSR) from 6 to 8 hours;  Time-weighted sum of PRR scores over 8 hours (TOTPAR0-8) and over 6 to 8 hours (TOTPAR6-8) post-dose;  Duration of relief, as measured by the time to treatment failure (ie, time to first dose of rescue medication or drop out due to lack of efficacy);  The cumulative proportion of treatment failures at 6 and 8 hours post-dose;  Time to onset of “meaningful” relief. Primary Safety Endpoint:  AEs were recorded as they occurred or were reported. Safety Evaluations: AEs were recorded as they occurred or were reported. Subjects were closely monitored for any AE during surgery and the pain assessment period. A review of any reported AEs was completed at the end of the study. Each subject’s vital signs (ie, pulse, blood pressure [BP], respiratory rate [RR], and temperature) were measured at baseline (prior to dosing) and again at end of study or at the time of rescue medication (if needed). Statistical Methods: Statistically significant treatment differences were declared if the probability of random occurrence among or between the treatment groups, p, was 0.05 (2-sided). Treatment differences were declared marginally significant if 0.05<p0.10. All tests were 2-sided. The Type I error for the primary endpoint was protected by testing each hypothesis at a 0.05 level of significance (2-sided) in the following order: 1. IBU/APAP vs placebo 2. IBU/APAP vs IBU and IBU/APAP vs APAP 5. IBU vs APAP. A comparison was not eligible for being declared significant unless the one preceding it was also significant. Primary Endpoint: SPID[11]0-8 The primary endpoint, SPID[11]0-8 hours (based on numerical scale), was analyzed using the main effects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, sex, and baseline categorical PSR as classification variables, and baseline numerical PSR terms in the model as a continuous covariate. For each pair-wise comparison of interest, the treatment difference based on the least squares means (LSM), the p-value and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the main effects model are presented. The treatment-by-baseline categorical PSR and treatment-by-sex interaction effects were assessed for the primary endpoint only by adding each of these terms, one at a time to the main effects model. If any of the interaction terms were found to be significant at the 0.05 level of significance, additional analyses were to be conducted as appropriate. Analysis Methods for Secondary Endpoints:  SPID[11]6-8 hours (based on numerical scale), was analyzed using the main effects ANCOVA model similar to the primary endpoint.  TOTPAR0-8 and TOTPAR6-8 were analyzed using the main effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment, baseline categorical PSR, and sex terms in the model.  Duration of relief, as measured by the time to treatment failure (ie, time to first dose of rescue medication or drop out due to lack of efficacy) and time to onset of “meaningful” relief were analyzed using the Gehan-Wilcoxon test with effects for treatment, sex, and baseline categorical PSR terms.  The cumulative proportions of treatment failures at 6 and 8 hours post-dose were analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel (CMH) general association using table scores. Safety Analysis The analysis of AEs included all events that initially occurred or worsened following treatment (or treatment-emergent AEs [TEAEs]). The incidence of AEs was summarized by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), and classified according to their severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and relationship (related or not related) to study product. For the summary by severity, subjects who had multiple occurrences of the same AE were classified according to the worst reported severity of the AE. Similarly, for the summary by relationship to the study product, the AE separately in a similar manner as all other AEs. The AEs were sorted alphabetically within a SOC. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition is summarized in Table 2. A total of 722 subjects were screened, out of which 568 subjects were randomized and included in the full analysis and safety sets. Fifty-six (56), 172, 175, and 165 subjects were randomized to placebo, FDC IBU 250 mg/APAP 500 mg, IBU 250 mg, and APAP 650 mg treatment groups, respectively. In total, 8 subjects (1.4%) discontinued from the study: 1 subject discontinued from the IBU 250 mg treatment group due to an AE of emesis and 7 subjects were no longer willing to participate in the study. Since the protocol population consisted of more than 90% of the full analysis set (FAS) subject population, a per protocol analysis was not performed.

Duration of Relief Measured by Time to Treatment Failure: The results for duration of relief measured by time to treatment failure are summarized for the FAS in Table 8. A lower percentage of subjects reported treatment failure in the FDC IBU 250 mg/APAP 500 mg treatment group (55.8%) when compared to the placebo (71.4%), IBU 250 mg (60.0%), and APAP 650 mg (63.6%) treatment groups. The time to treatment failure was significantly longer for all treatment groups when compared to placebo (p <0.001 for all comparisons). Furthermore, the FDC treatment group time to treatment failure (median: 629 minutes) was significantly longer than APAP 650 mg (median: 449.0 minutes; p <0.001) and marginally longer than IBU 250 mg alone (median: 608.5 minutes; p = 0.069). The Kaplan-Meier plot over time for duration of relief measured by time to treatment failure results is presented for the FAS in Figure 3.

Safety Results: A summary of TEAEs with an incidence rate 2% is provided in Table 11. The incidence of TEAEs was lower among treatment groups compared to placebo, with an overall lower TEAE incidence rate in the FDC IBU 250 mg/APAP 500 mg treatment group compared to IBU 250 mg and APAP 650 mg alone: Nineteen (19) (33.93%) subjects experienced TEAEs for the placebo group, 21 (12.21%) for the FDC IBU 250 mg/APAP 500 mg group, 37 (21.14%) for the IBU 250 mg group, and 41 (24.85%) for the APAP 650 mg group. groups: 18 (32.14%) for placebo, 19 (11.05%) for FDC IBU 250 mg/APAP 500 mg, 26 (14.86%) for IBU 250 mg, and 34 (20.61%) for APAP 650 mg. Nausea and vomiting were the most frequently reported AEs for all treatment groups. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity for all treatment groups. AE incidences for subjects with moderate and severe pain at baseline were consistent with the safety population. There were no serious AEs (SAEs), treatment-related AEs, or deaths reported in this study. One (1) subject in the IBU 250 mg treatment group discontinued study medication and withdrew from the study due to an AE of emesis. Table 11.

CONCLUSIONS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single oral dose dental pain study evaluating the analgesic efficacy and safety of 2 caplets of FDC IBU 125 mg/APAP 250 mg (total dose IBU 250 mg/APAP 500 mg) compared to IBU 250 mg alone, APAP 650 mg alone, and placebo. All active treatment groups were significantly more efficacious compared to placebo. Furthermore, the FDC IBU/APAP formulation was significantly more efficacious than both IBU 250 mg and APAP 650 mg administered alone. There were no deaths, SAEs, or other significant AEs reported during the study. Overall, there were no new safety concerns observed and all treatments were well-tolerated in this study.
