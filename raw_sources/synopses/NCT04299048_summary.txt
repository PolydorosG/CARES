This endpoint is not described in the CSR. Statistical methods used in the study are as follows: Safety: All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and who received at least 1 dose of study intervention were included in the safety analysis. AEs, laboratory data, vital signs (including BP and pulse rate), and ECGs were reviewed and summarized. Safety data were presented in tabular format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate. PK: The PK concentration population for ponsegromab was defined as all randomized participants who received a dose of ponsegromab and had at least 1 serum concentration of ponsegromab reported. Presentations for serum unbound and total ponsegromab concentrations included listings, plots, and descriptive summaries. No formal inferential statistics were applied to the PK data. PD: All randomized participants who received a dose of ponsegromab and had at least 1 serum GDF-15 concentration reported were included in the PD analysis. Presentations for serum unbound and total GDF-15 concentrations included listings, plots, and descriptive summaries. Immunogenicity:  the dose level and/or frequency to be administered in Cohort 2. Cohort 2, however, was not conducted. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): Approximately 8 participants were planned to be enrolled such that approximately 6 evaluable participants completed the study. A total of 20 participants were screened for eligibility, of which 11 participants were enrolled. A total of 10 participants were treated, and all 10 treated participants were included in the safety and efficacy analysis population. All 10 treated participants, with at least 1 serum ponsegromab concentration, were included in the PK analysis set. Concentration data from 3 participants at Day 1 3H, 1 participant at Day 85 3H, and 1 participant on Day 169 were excluded from summary statistics due to sampling time deviation >20%. All 10 treated participants had at least 1 serum GDF-15 concentration and were included in the PD analysis set. All 10 treated participants had at least 1 ADA result and were included in the immunogenicity analysis set. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Enrolled in this study were adult participants with cachexia, elevated serum concentrations of circulating GDF-15 ≥ , and advanced metastatic NSCLC, advanced/unresectable pancreatic cancer or metastatic colorectal cancer. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): Ponsegromab solution for injection was provided centrally by the sponsor in a 6-mL glass vial with a 1 mL withdrawal volume. During the 12-week treatment period, ponsegromab was subcutaneously (SC) administered every 3 weeks (Q3W). Ponsegromab was administered by study personnel first, followed by any premedications administered at the clinic (eg, antihistamine, anti-inflammatory agent, or pain reliever) and then the standard of care (SOC) prescribed anti-tumor therapy. If the SOC anti-tumor therapy was administered on the same day of ponsegromab dosing, ponsegromab must have been given at least 0.5 hours prior to administration of the SOC anti-tumor therapy.

Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: The majority of participants were white (7 [70%] participants), male (7 [70%] participants), with a median age of 69.5 years (range: 47-81 years). The median body weight and body mass index (BMI) were 71.85 kg (range: 47.17-106.14 kg) and 22.88 kg/m2 (range: 17.31-30.87 kg/m2), respectively. Of the 10 treated participants, 3 had pancreatic, 3 had lung, and 4 had colon cancer described in their medical history. Exposure: During the 12-week treatment period, ponsegromab was SC administered at Q3W. Efficacy Results: Change From Baseline in LSMI by CT Scan The mean (SD) baseline LSMI was 45.17 (8.80) cm2/m2. Mean increases from baseline in LSMI were observed at both time points during the treatment period (Weeks 6 and 12), with the mean (SD) increase of 1.30 (2.97) and 0.44 (2.95) cm2/m2 at Week 6 and Week 12, respectively. Change From Baseline in Body Weight The mean (SD) baseline body weight was 70.49 (16.97) kg. Mean increases from baseline in body weight (either in absolute values or percent changes) were observed at all time points during the treatment period (Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12) and during follow-up (Weeks 15, 18 and 24), with greater increase over time up to Week 18. The maximal mean (SD) body weight increase from baseline was 6.17 (7.66) kg at Week 18, with a mean (SD) percent increase from baseline of 7.85% (9.57). An MMRM model was used to analyze CFB in body weight at Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24. A greater LS mean increase from baseline over time (up to Week 15) was observed. The    Safety Results: All 10 (100%) participants reported at least 1 TEAE. There were 92 TEAEs in total, and none were considered treatment-related by the investigator or sponsor. TEAEs of Grade 2, 3, 4, and 5 were reported in 4 (40%), 3 (30%), 2 (20%), and 1 (10%) participant, respectively. No injection site reactions were reported. The most frequently reported all-causality TEAEs by System Organ Class (SOC) was Gastrointestinal Disorders (8 [80%] participants) followed by Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (7 [70%] participants), Investigations (6 [60%] participants), and Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (5 [50%] participants). The most frequently reported all-causality TEAEs by Preferred Term (PT) were anaemia and diarrhoea (5 [50%] participants each) followed by nausea and fatigue (4 [40%] participants each). A total of 5 SAEs were reported in 4 participants, of which none were considered treatment-related. Pharmacokinetic Results: Following SC administration of Q3W doses of ponsegromab, geometric mean unbound ponsegromab C ranged from 4.041 to 4383 ng/mL between Day 22 and trough Day 106. The lowest C was observed after the first dose of ponsegromab (Day 22) where trough 3 out of 8 participants had concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), and highest C was observed on Day 85. Large inter-individual variability in unbound trough C was observed at all visits (geometric percent coefficient of variation [%CV] ≥142% at trough all timepoints). Geometric mean total ponsegromab C increased over time, ranging from 10050 ng/mL trough on Day 22 to 25450 ng/mL on Day 106. Inter-individual variability for total ponsegromab C ranged from 16% to 32% based on geometric %CV. trough Pharmacodynamic Results: Median serum unbound GDF-15 concentration was 2269 pg/mL at baseline. Following SC administration of ponsegromab at Q3W, median unbound GDF-15 concentrations were below LLOQ (42.4 pg/mL) from Day 1 to Day 106 and returned to approximately baseline level by Day 127 and slightly above baseline on Day 169. The median percent CFB in serum unbound GDF-15 concentration ranged from -98.13% to -96.95% from Day 1 to Day 106, and was 2.169% and 69.20% on follow-up Days 127 and 169, respectively. Median serum total GDF-15 concentration was 4.260 ng/mL at baseline. Following SC administration of ponsegromab at Q3W, median serum total GDF-15 concentrations increased over time, with median percent CFB ranging from 235.9% to 90810% from Day 1 Immunogenicity Results: All 10 ponsegromab treated participants were ADA negative at baseline. Following 5 SC doses of ponsegromab at Q3W, no participants had positive ADA. As such, no samples were tested for NAb and all participants were assumed to be NAb-negative. Thus, the overall incidence of ADA and NAb was 0% in this study, based on these 9 participants with post-dose ADA samples available. Conclusions: Safety  Ponsegromab was generally safe and well-tolerated following Q3W SC administration in the target patient population (with NSCLC, pancreatic cancer or colorectal cancer, and cachexia).  No TEAEs were considered treatment-related. There were no apparent adverse trends in safety laboratory tests, vital signs or ECG parameters that were attributed to ponsegromab dosing. PK  Following SC administration of ponsegromab at Q3W, the geometric mean unbound ponsegromab C ranged from 4.041 to 4383 ng/mL between Day 22 and trough Day 106, with large inter-individual variability observed at all visits.  Geometric mean total ponsegromab C increased over time, ranging from trough 10050 ng/mL on Day 22 to 25450 ng/mL on Day 106. PD  Following SC administration of ponsegromab at Q3W, median unbound GDF-15 concentrations were suppressed from the baseline concentration of 2269 pg/mL to below the lower limit of quantification (42.4 pg/mL) at all visits between Day 1 and Day 106.  Median serum total GDF-15 concentrations increased over time, with median percent CFB ranging from 235.9% to 90810% from Day 1 to Day 106. Immunogenicity  Following SC administration of ponsegromab at Q3W, the incidence of treatment-induced ADA was 0%, based on the 9 participants with post-treatment ADA samples.
