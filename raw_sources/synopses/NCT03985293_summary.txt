Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation Date: 07 July 2020 Study Completion Date: Primary Completion Date: 08 June 2021; Last Participant Last Visit: 07 July 2021 Report Date: 02 February 2022 Previous Report Date(s): Not Applicable Phase of Development: Phase 2b Primary and Secondary Study Objectives, Endpoints and Estimands: The primary and secondary study objectives, endpoints and estimands are presented in Table S1. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS METHODS Study Design: This Phase 2b, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-arm, parallel group, study assessed efficacy and safety of twice daily (BID) administration of danuglipron in adult participants with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy or diet and exercise alone. At least 80% of the enrolled participants were required to be on metformin prior to screening. For those participants, the dose of metformin remained the same until the first follow-up visit (ie, visit 10, Week 17-18), except in circumstances where a dose change was deemed medically necessary. While a smaller proportion of participants managing their T2DM with diet and exercise only was permitted, this proportion was no more than approximately 20% of enrolled participants. Following the screening period to confirm eligibility (up to 4-weeks), the study consisted of a 2-week placebo run-in period, prior to randomization on Day 1. The treatment period was 16 weeks, followed by an approximate 4-week follow-up. The total duration of participation in this study was approximately 22 weeks, not including the screening period. Dosing occurred with food BID, and up to 6 weeks of the 16-week dosing duration was used for dose titration to maximize tolerability of danuglipron. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Male and female participants with T2DM who were treated with metformin and/or diet and exercise, at Visit 1, were between the ages of 18 and 75 years, inclusive, with a body mass index (BMI) of 24.5 to 45.4 kg/m2 (for sites in North America and Europe) or BMI of 22.5 to 45.4 kg/m2 (for sites in Asia), a total body weight >50 kg (110 lb), and HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10.5% at screening (Visit 1). Study Treatment: Participants took 4 tablets of investigational product (IP) (danuglipron or matching placebo) in the morning with food and 4 tablets of IP in the evening with food, for a total of 8 tablets of IP daily. Participants swallowed the IP whole, and did not crush, chew, break, or dissolve the IP prior to swallowing. The same dosing paradigm was used during the placebo run-in period. Study drug information is provided in Table S2. Table S2. Investigational Product Description Efficacy Evaluations: Efficacy assessments for this study included measurements of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and body weight. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 16 (Estimand 1A). Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:  The response as defined by an HbA1c 7% at Week 16 (Estimand 2).  Change from baseline in HbA1c at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 (Estimand 1A).  Change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 (Estimand 1A).  Change from baseline in body weight at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 (Estimand 1A). Body weight was measured in duplicate. The second weight measurement was obtained at least 1-2 minutes apart from the first measurement. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included AEs and SAEs monitoring, clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECG monitoring, physical examinations, pregnancy test, body weight, and management of glycemic control. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: Safety: The safety data was summarized in accordance with Pfizer Data Standards. All participants who received IP (safety population) were included in the safety analyses. All safety data was summarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulation, descriptive statistics, categorical summaries, and graphical presentations. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 859 participants were screened in the study, among whom, 412 participants were randomized, and 411 participants were treated; 1 participant randomized to the danuglipron 120 mg BID group was not treated. A total of 316 (76.9%) participants completed the double-blind treatment.  A total of 95 participants discontinued from the double-blind treatment: 9 (13.6%) participants in the placebo group, 14 (20.6%) participants in the danuglipron 2.5 mg BID group, 5 (7.4%) participants in the danuglipron 10 mg BID group, 14 (19.7%) participants in the danuglipron 40 mg BID group, 20 (29.9%) participants in the danuglipron 80 mg BID group, and 33 (46.5%) participants in the danuglipron 120 mg BID group.  In the overall study population, the most common reason for discontinuation during the double-blind treatment period was AE (57 [13.9%] participants), followed by withdrawal by participant (14 [3.4%] participants) and lost to follow-up (11 [2.7%] participants). The most common reason for discontinuation for each treatment group was AE, except for the danuglipron 2.5 mg BID group for which the most common reason for discontinuation was withdrawal by participant. There was a dose-related increase in the proportion of participants discontinuing due to AE (2.9%, 4.4%, 11.3%, 22.4% and 33.8% in the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg BID goups, respectively, compared to 7.6% in the placebo group). A total of 359 (87.3%) participants completed the follow-up period, which included participants who completed the double-blind treatment and participants who discontinued the double-blind treatment but remained in the study. A total of 52 participants discontinued during the follow-up period. In the overall population, the most common reason for discontinuation during the follow-up period was withdrawal by participant (20 [4.9%] participants). A total of 315 (76.6%) participants completed both the double-blind treatment and follow-up period. Among 411 treated participants, 209 (50.9%) participants were male, and 202 (49.1%) participants were female. Across all the treatment groups, the treated population was generally similar for age, race, and BMI, with the majority of participants being White, mean age being 58.6 years and mean BMI being 32.8 kg/m2. The mean body weight among all participants was 91.3 kg. Efficacy Results: Primary Endpoint - Change From Baseline in HbA1c at Week 16 – Estimand Set 1A The statistical analysis of the primary endpoint was conducted using an MMRM model for the change from baseline in HbA1c through Week 16. All danuglipron dose groups demonstrated statistically significant (2-sided p-value <0.10) dose-responsive declines in the least squares (LS) mean changes from baseline in HbA1c at Week 16, with LS mean changes of -0.49%, -0.91%, -1.03%, -0.96% and -1.18% for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg BID groups, respectively, compared to -0.02% for the placebo group. At Week 16, the LS mean differences (90% confidence interval [CI]) to placebo in HbA1c were -0.47% (-0.76%, -0.18%), -0.90% (-1.18%, -0.62%), -1.01% (-1.30%, -0.73%), -0.94% (-1.24%, -0.65%), and -1.16% (-1.47%, -0.86%) for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg BID groups, respectively. Secondary Endpoints Response as Defined by an HbA1c 7% at Week 16 – Estimand Set 2 Greater proportions of participants in the danuglipron dose groups achieved an HbA1c <7% at Week 16 compared to the placebo group. The observed proportion of participants with an HbA1c response <7% in the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg BID groups were 30.8%, 54.1%, 58.2%, 65.2% and 60.5%, respectively, compared to 7.7% in the placebo group. The modelled proportions after multiple imputation gave similar results. The odds ratios (danuglipron vs placebo) for the proportion of participants with HbA1c <7% at Week 16 were 5.11 (90% CI: 1.84, 14.18), 16.85 (90% CI: 6.18, 45.93), 18.79 (90% CI: 7.03, 50.21), 23.97 (90% CI: 8.66, 66.39) and 24.46 (90% CI: 8.72, 68.57) for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg BID groups, respectively. Change From Baseline in HbA1c at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 – Estimand Set 1A Declines from baseline in HbA1c were observed at Week 2 in all danuglipron dose groups, with generally greater magnitudes of decline over time through to Week 16. Minimal declines from baseline were observed in the placebo group, with no clear changes in magnitude over time. The largest LS mean decline from baseline was observed in the danuglipron 120 mg BID group at Week 16 (-1.18%) relative to the other doses and timepoints. All danuglipron dose groups demonstrated statistically significant (2-sided p-value <0.10) dose-responsive declines in the LS mean change from baseline in HbA1c compared to the placebo group at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12, except for the danuglipron 2.5 mg BID group at Week 2 (p-value = 0.1578). Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 – Estimand Set 1A The statistical analysis of this endpoint was conducted using an MMRM model for the change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose through Week 16. At Week 16, the LS mean changes from baseline in fasting plasma glucose were -12.81 mg/dL, -24.53 mg/dL, -30.47 mg/dL, -25.71 mg/dL, and -31.93 mg/dL for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg BID groups, respectively, compared to 1.31 mg/dL for the placebo group. The LS mean differences to placebo in fasting plasma glucose were -14.12 mg/dL, -25.84 mg/dL, -31.78 mg/dL, -27.02 mg/dL, and -33.24 mg/dL for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg BID groups, respectively. Declines from baseline in fasting plasma glucose were observed at Week 2 in all danuglipron dose groups, with no apparent further reduction in fasting plasma glucose through to Week 16, with the exception of the danuglipron 2.5 mg BID group that appeared to have smaller reductions in declines from baseline over time. Minimal declines from baseline were observed in the placebo group, with no clear changes in magnitude over time. The largest declines from baseline were observed in the danuglipron 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg BID groups at a variety of timepoints relative to the danuglipron 2.5 mg BID group and the placebo group. There were statistically significant (2-sided p-value <0.10) declines from baseline in fasting plasma glucose for all danuglipron dose groups relative to placebo at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16, except for the danuglipron 2.5 mg BID group at Week 8 (p-value = 0.5449) and Week 12 (p-value = 0.2940). Change From Baseline in Body Weight at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 – Estimand Set 1A The statistical analysis of this endpoint was conducted using an MMRM model for the change from baseline in body weight through Week 16. At Week 16, the LS mean changes from baseline in body weight were 0.02 kg, -0.06 kg, -1.16 kg, -2.48 kg, and -4.60 kg for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg BID groups, respectively, compared to -0.43 kg for the placebo group. The LS mean differences to placebo in body weight were 0.45 kg, 0.38 kg, -0.73 kg, -2.04 kg, and -4.17 kg for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg BID groups, respectively, with danuglipron dose groups of 80 mg and 120 mg BID demonstrating statistically significant (2-sided p-value <0.10) declines in the LS mean changes from baseline in body weight at Week 16, relative to placebo. The supplementary analysis of modelling the percent change from baseline in body weight gave similar results. At Week 16, the LS mean percent change from baseline in body weight 80 mg, and 120 mg BID groups, respectively, compared to -0.48% for the placebo group. The LS mean percent differences to placebo in body weight were 0.53%, 0.42%, -0.90%, -2.21%, and -4.38% for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg BID groups, respectively. Declines from baseline in body weight were observed at Week 2 in the danuglipron 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg BID groups that increased in magnitude through Week 8 in the 40 mg BID group, through Week 12 in the 80 mg BID group and through to Week 16 in the 120 mg BID group. Minimal declines from baseline were observed in the placebo, danuglipron 2.5 mg and 10 mg BID groups, with no clear changes in magnitude over time. The largest declines from baseline were observed in the danuglipron 120 mg BID group at Weeks 8, 12 and 16 compared to the other dose groups and timepoints. There were statistically significant (2-sided p-value <0.10) reductions from baseline in body weight relative to placebo in the danuglipron 80 mg and 120 mg BID groups at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 and in the danuglipron 40 mg BID group at Weeks 4, 6 and 8. Safety Results: AEs An overview of all-causality and treatment-related TEAEs, by treatment group, is provided in Table S3. In this study, out of the 411 treated participants, 224 (54.5%) participants experienced a total of 538 all-causality TEAEs. Of these reported TEAEs, 267 TEAEs were determined to be treatment-related by the investigator and were reported in 128 (31.1%) participants. The number of all-causality TEAEs generally increased with higher doses of danuglipron (74, 75, 93, 122, and 129 all-causality TEAEs in the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg BID groups, respectively) and was higher in all danuglipron dose groups compared with the placebo group (45 all-causality TEAEs). There were 13 (3.2%) participants who experienced SAEs, and 1 of these SAEs, which occurred in the danuglipron 80 mg BID group, was reported as treatment-related by the investigator. There were 13 (3.2%) participants who experienced severe AEs, and 3 (0.7%) participants experienced treatment-related severe AEs per investigator assessment. Twelve (2.9%) participants discontinued from the study due to all-causality TEAEs, while 45 (10.9%) participants discontinued the study drug due to all-causality TEAEs but continued in the study. The proportion of participants who discontinued from the study due to all-causality TEAEs was higher with greater danuglipron doses. The proportion of participants who discontinued the study drug due to all-causality TEAEs was higher, relative to placebo, with doses of danuglipron 40 mg BID and greater. The proportion of participants with dose reduction or temporary discontinuation due to all-causality TEAEs was higher, relative to placebo, with doses of danuglipron 40 mg BID and greater. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS The most frequently reported all-causality TEAEs (≥5% of participants) were nausea (68 [16.5%] participants), diarrhoea (36 [8.8%] participants), vomiting (35 [8.5%] participants) and headache (23 [5.6%] participants). The majority of all-causality TEAEs were reported as mild (365/538, 67.8%) in severity, with 154/538 (28.6%) reported as moderate and 19/538 (3.5%) as severe. In general, a greater number of moderate and severe AEs, combined, were reported across the 2 highest doses of danuglipron (80 mg and 120 mg BID), when compared with lower doses of danuglipron and placebo. A similar number of moderate and severe AEs, combined, were reported across the lower doses of danuglipron (2.5 mg, 10 mg and 40 mg BID), which were greater than that reported for placebo. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs (≥5% of participants) were nausea (66 [16.1%] participants), vomiting (33 [8.0%] participants), and diarrhoea (26 [6.3%] participants). The majority of treatment-related TEAEs were reported as mild (165/267) in severity, with 95/267 reported as moderate and 7/267 as severe. In general, a greater number of moderate and severe AEs were reported for the 2 highest doses of danuglipron (80 mg and 120 mg BID), when compared with lower doses of danuglipron and placebo. SAEs are experienced for 13 participants. One participant in the danuglipron 40 mg BID group reported atorvastatin-related (by the investigator and sponsor) SAEs of blood alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased, drug-induced liver injuries (DILIs) (verbatim terms: potential case of DILI due to elevated ALP, and due to elevated aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), condition aggravated, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) increased, ALT increased, and AST increased. Of note, the verbatim term was “potential DILI” and the participant did not meet the protocol-defined criteria for potential DILI. One SAE in the danuglipron 80 mg BID group of cholecystitis acute was reported as related to danuglipron by the investigator; of note, this SAE occurred on Study Day 45, which was 42 days after the last dose of study medication on Study Day 3 and was assessed as not related to study medication by the sponsor. Hypoglycemic AEs AEs of hypoglycaemia were reported in 15 (3.6%) participants in this study, with higher incidence at doses of danuglipron 40 mg BID and above, compared with lower doses of danuglipron; no participants experienced AE of hypoglycaemia in the placebo group. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia and asymptomatic hypoglycemia were more commonly reported than probable symptomatic hypoglycemia, while no severe hypoglycemia was reported in this study. COVID-19-Related AEs A total of 20 (4.9%) participants had corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related TEAEs coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) test positive, 4 participants had a TEAE of suspected COVID-19 and 2 participants had a TEAE of COVID-19 pneumonia. There was no apparent relationship of incidence of COVID-19-related AEs with danuglipron dose relative to placebo. There were no deaths during the treatment phase of the study, but there were 3 deaths in the follow-up phase, all of which were related to COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2. Deaths There were no deaths during the treatment phase of the study, but there were 3 deaths in the follow-up phase that were not related to the study drug.  One participant died of COVID-19 pneumonia from the danuglipron 2.5 mg BID group, who also experienced the following symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia: hypercapnia, acidosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.  One participant died of COVID-19 pneumonia from the danuglipron 40 mg BID group.  One participant from the danuglipron 40 mg BID group died due to AE of acute respiratory distress syndrome, also related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical Laboratory Evaluation The most frequent laboratory abnormality was GGT (U/L) ≥1.0 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (101 [24.6%] participants), followed by calcitonin (pg/mL) >1.0 × ULN (50 [12.3%] participants), and triacylglycerol lipase (U/L) >1.0 × ULN (42 [10.4%] participants). The abnormality of GGT (U/L) ≥1.0 × ULN was experienced by 21.1% - 29.4% participants across the danuglipron groups compared to 29.2% in the placebo group. The abnormality of calcitonin (pg/mL) >1.0 × ULN was experienced by 6.2% - 17.6% participants across the danuglipron groups compared to 12.3% in the placebo group. The abnormality of triacylglycerol lipase (U/L) >1.0 × ULN was experienced by 7.7% - 15.9% participants across the danuglipron groups compared to 7.7% in the placebo group. There was no apparent adverse dose-related increase in the frequency of laboratory abnormalities. Vital Signs Eighteen (4.4%) participants had systolic blood pressure (SBP) increases ≥30 mm Hg and 21 (5.1%) participants had SBP decreases ≥30 mm Hg. Thirteen (3.2%) participants had diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increases ≥20 mm Hg and 14 (3.4%) participants had DBP decreases ≥20 mm Hg. No participants had pulse rate values meeting the pre-specified criteria for abnormality (40 beats per minute [bpm] or 120 bpm) in this study. There were no apparent differences in the frequency of vital sign abnormalities between the placebo and Across the dosing interval, mean changes in pulse rate ranged from -0.9 to 7.4 bpm across doses of danuglipron, compared to a range of 0.8 to 5.3 bpm in placebo. At Week 16 2H timepoint, there were larger decreases from baseline in SBP for the majority of danuglipron doses, relative to placebo. The majority of danuglipron doses did not have as large reductions from baseline in DBP compared to placebo at the 2H timepoint at Weeks 4 and 8. At Week 16 2H timepoint, the placebo and danuglipron groups had similar changes in DBP. Small dose-dependent increases in pulse rate were observed. ECG There were no apparent dose-related increases in the frequency of ECG abnormalities by categorical analysis. There was no evidence of clinically significant adverse trends across the danuglipron dose groups. Conclusions: Efficacy  All danuglipron dose groups demonstrated statistically significant dose-responsive declines in the LS mean changes from baseline in HbA1c at Week 16, with LS mean changes of -0.49%, -0.91%, -1.03%, -0.96% and -1.18% for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg BID groups, respectively, compared to -0.02% for the placebo group.  Greater proportions of participants in the danuglipron dose groups achieved an HbA1c <7% at Week 16 compared to the placebo group.  All danuglipron dose groups demonstrated statistically significant dose-responsive declines in the LS mean change from baseline in HbA1c compared to the placebo group at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12, except for the danuglipron 2.5 mg BID group at Week 2.  At Week 16, the LS mean changes from baseline in fasting plasma glucose were -12.81 mg/dL, -24.53 mg/dL, -30.47 mg/dL, -25.71 mg/dL, and -31.93 mg/dL for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg BID groups, respectively, compared to 1.31 mg/dL for the placebo group.  There were statistically significant declines from baseline in fasting plasma glucose for all danuglipron dose groups relative to placebo at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16, except for the danuglipron 2.5 mg BID group at Weeks 8 and 12.  At Week 16, the LS mean changes from baseline in body weight were 0.02 kg, -0.06 kg, -1.16 kg, -2.48 kg, and -4.60 kg for the danuglipron 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg BID groups, respectively, compared to -0.43 kg for the placebo group.  There were statistically significant reductions from baseline in body weight relative to placebo in the danuglipron 80 mg and 120 mg BID groups at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 and in the danuglipron 40 mg BID group at Weeks 4, 6 and 8. Safety  In adult participants with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy or diet and exercise alone:  BID administration of danuglipron at multiple dose levels (2.5 mg, 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and 120 mg BID) was generally safe at all doses with a tolerability profile in line with the mechanism of action.  Dose-related gastrointestinal adverse reactions were observed, the most common being nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The majority of these events were mild to moderate in intensity, did not lead to serious sequelae and resolved upon discontinuation.  Doses of danuglipron up to and including 40 mg BID were well-tolerated. Rates of discontinuation from study medication and study were higher with danuglipron doses of 80 mg and 120 mg BID.  No dose-related adverse trends in laboratory, ECG or vital sign abnormalities were apparent, relative to placebo.
