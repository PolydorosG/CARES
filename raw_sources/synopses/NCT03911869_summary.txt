METHODS Study Design: This was a multicenter, randomized open-label Phase 2 study to assess the safety, efficacy and PK of 2 dosing regimens of encorafenib + binimetinib combination therapy in patients with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma with asymptomatic brain metastasis. Approximately 110 eligible patients were planned to be enrolled, including 9 patients in a single-arm Safety Lead-in (SLI) (Figure S1). After a Screening Period, treatment was administered in 28-day cycles and continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, start of subsequent anticancer therapy, or death. Once the patient discontinued study treatment, the Treatment Period was to end, and the patient was to enter the Follow-up Period. However, after review of the participant data from the SLI phase on 03 June 2020, it was decided by Pfizer and the Steering Committee that the high dose combination of encorafenib + binimetinib would not be evaluated in Phase 2 of the study based on the specified DLT criteria and safety parameters as outlined in the Protocol. Pfizer decided to terminate the study on 02 June 2021 due to the challenging enrolment. Figure S1. Planned Study Design Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Male and female participants ≥18 years of age with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma with brain metastasis who met all inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Key inclusion criteria were as follows: 1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma with metastases to the 2. Presence of BRAFV600 mutation in tumor tissue previously determined by a local PCR or NGS-based assay at any time prior to Screening or by a central laboratory during Screening. 3. Patients were required to submit archival or fresh tumor tissue and a blood sample prior to enrollment. Tissue samples were used to determine BRAFV600-mutation status by central laboratory. 4. Must have had at least 1 parenchymal brain lesion ≥0.5 cm and ≤4 cm, defined as an MRI contrast-enhancing lesion that may have been accurately measured in at least 1 dimension. 5. Patients may have received the following prior therapies: a. Safety Lead-in, Phase 2 Randomized, Phase 2 Arm A Cohort 1: May have received prior local therapy for brain metastases including but not restricted to brain surgery, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery (eg, gamma knife, linear-accelerated-based radiosurgery, charged particles, and CyberKnife). Multiple local (brain) therapies or combinations of local therapies were allowed. For patients receiving local therapy to all brain lesions (including WBRT), progression of pre-existing lesions based on RECIST 1.1 (> 20% increase in longest diameter on baseline scan) or new measurable lesions were required. For patients receiving local therapy for some but not all lesions, disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 was not required as long as there were remaining brain lesions that were measurable and not previously treated. All patients (SLI and Phase 2): May have received prior immunotherapy. Key exclusion criteria were as follows: 1. Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis (eg, had neurologic symptoms related to brain metastases). 2. Prophylactic or preventive anti-epileptic therapy. 3. Treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery or craniotomy within 14 days prior to start of study treatment, or treatment with whole-brain radiation within 28 days prior to study treatment. Patients who had received local therapy should have had complete recovery with no neurological sequelae. 4. Patients treated in the adjuvant setting with BRAF or MEK inhibitor(s) <6 months prior to enrollment. Patients who had received BRAF or MEK inhibitors in the metastatic setting were excluded.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoint:  Extracranial response rate per RECIST v1.1.  Global response rate (brain metastasis response per mRECIST v1.1 and extracranial response per RECIST v1.1).  DCR o for brain metastasis response per mRECIST v1.1. o for extracranial response per RECIST v1.1. o for global response (brain metastasis per mRECIST v1.1 and extracranial per RECIST v1.1).  DOR o for brain metastasis response per mRECIST v1.1. o for extracranial response per RECIST v1.1. o for global response (brain metastasis per mRECIST v1.1 and extracranial per RECIST v1.1).  PFS o for brain metastasis per mRECIST v1.1. o for global assessment (brain metastasis per mRECIST v1.1 and extracranial disease per RECIST v1.1).  BMRR per mRECIST v1.1 for SLI only.  OS Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Human blood samples were analyzed for determining concentrations of encorafenib, its metabolite LHY746, binimetinib, and the active metabolite of binimetinib (AR00426032) by a designated service provider using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) assay. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 1.00 ng/m for encorafenib, binimetinib and AR00426032, and was 2.00 ng/m for LHY746. The PK parameter values were calculated for each participant using non-compartmental analysis of concentration-time data. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring; vital signs (temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure); physical, dermatological, and ophthalmic examinations; 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs); echocardiogram/multi-gated acquisition (MUGA); adverse events and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: BMRR was calculated by dividing the number of patients with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) in brain metastasis by the number of patients in the respective cohort. The corresponding exact Clopper-Pearson 2-sided 90% and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Extracranial response rate was calculated by dividing the number of patients with a BOR of CR or PR in extracranial lesions by the number of patients in the respective cohort with corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Global response rate was calculated by dividing the number of patients with a BOR of CR or PR in both brain and extracranial lesions by the number of patients in the respective cohort with corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. DCR was calculated for brain metastasis per mRECIST v1.1, extracranial lesion response per RECIST v1.1 and global response along with corresponding exact Clopper-Pearson 2-sided 95% CI. DOR was calculated for patients with a confirmed response (CR or PR) for brain metastasis per mRECIST v1.1 and global response (brain metastasis and extracranial lesions). DOR rates at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months were estimated with corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs. Pharmacokinetic: The individual plasma concentration-time data for each analyte was evaluated with noncompartmental analysis (NCA) using Phoenix WinNonlin®, version 8.0 or higher. Actual blood collection times and doses on the day of PK sampling were used for PK calculations. Each parameter for each analyte was summarized in tables by dose, treatment cohort or arm and combined arms as appropriate, cycle and study day using the following descriptive statistics: n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), geometric mean, geometric CV, minimum, median and maximum. Safety: The safety set was used for summaries of safety data, except for DLTs for which the dose-determining set was used. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize safety data. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 13 participants (10 in the SLI and 3 in Phase 2) were enrolled and treated in the study. In the SLI, 10 participants started with the high dose of encorafenib 300 mg BID and binimetinib 45 mg BID. In Phase 2, 3 participants started with the standard dose of encorafenib 450 mg QD and binimetinib 45 mg BID, 2 participants tolerated the encorafenib 450 mg QD dose and were allowed intra-patient dose escalation to 600 mg QD after 4 weeks and 1 participant was not allowed to escalate due to protocol defined AEs during Cycle 1. All 13 participants discontinued from the treatment. The most frequent primary reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression (radiological, 84.6%). All 13 participants discontinued from the study. The most frequent primary reason for discontinuation from the study was death (76.9%). The median age of all participants was 56.0 years, with 8 (61.5%) participants 65 years of age. The majority of participants were male (76.9%) and White (92.3%). Prior Anticancer Treatments: Ten (76.9%) participants had prior anticancer regimens. Of those, 9 participants had 1 regimen and 1 participant had 2 regimens. Of the 9 participants in the SLI who had prior anticancer systemic treatment, 8 participants received nivolumab and 1 participant received ipilimumab. Two (15.4%) participants received at least 1 prior radiotherapy and 1 (7.7%) received prior local brain radiotherapy. Eleven (84.6%) participants had at least 1 prior surgery with 3 (27.3%) at primary site and 8 (72.7%) at metastatic site. The most frequently reported location was lymph node (36.4%). Efficacy Results: Assessments of anti-tumor activity of encorafenib + binimetinib combination therapy were determined using RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST v1.1. Given the small number of patients in the efficacy set of Phase 2 (n=3), all the efficacy endpoints were also analyzed for SLI participants (n=10) in the safety set. Secondary endpoints of DOR (for extracranial response), PFS and OS were not reported in the abbreviated clinical study report, given the small sample size. Primary Efficacy Results Brain Metastasis Response Rate per mRECIST v1.1 in Phase 2: Of the 3 participants in Phase 2, no participants achieved a confirmed CR, and 2 (66.7%) participants achieved a confirmed PR, therefore the confirmed BMRR was 66.7% (90% CI: 13.5, 98.3; 95% CI: 9.4, 99.2). Secondary Efficacy Results Extracranial Response Rate per RECIST v1.1: Of the 10 participants in the SLI, no participants achieved a confirmed CR, and 6 (60.0%) participants achieved a confirmed PR, therefore, the confirmed extracranial response rate was 60.0% (90% CI: 30.4, 85.0; 95% CI: 26.2, 87.8). Of the 3 participants in Phase 2, all achieved a confirmed PR, therefore the confirmed extracranial response rate was 100% (90% CI: 36.8, 100; 95% CI: 29.2, 100). Global Response Rate: Of the 10 participants in the SLI, no participants achieved a confirmed CR, and 5 (50.0%) participants achieved a confirmed PR, therefore, the confirmed global response rate was 50.0% (90% CI: 22.2, 77.8; 95% CI: 18.7, 81.3). Of the 3 participants in Phase 2, all achieved a confirmed PR, therefore the confirmed global response rate was 100% (90% CI: 36.8, 100; 95% CI: 29.2, 100). Disease Control Rate: DCR for brain metastasis, extracranial, and global response in the SLI were 100% (95% CI: 69.2, 100), 70% (95% CI: 34.8, 93.3), and 90% (95% CI: 55.5, 99.7), respectively. DCR for brain metastasis, extracranial, and global response in Phase 2 were all 100% (95% CI: 29.2, 100). Duration of Response: Median DOR for brain metastasis, and global response in the SLI confirmed responders were 3.3 months (95% CI: 2.8, 8.5), and 2.9 months (95% CI: 2.8, 8.5). Median DOR for brain metastasis, and global response in Phase 2 confirmed responders were 5.6 months (95% CI: 5.0, 6.2), and 5.0 months (95% CI: 3.9, 6.2). Brain Metastasis Response Rate per mRECIST v1.1 in the SLI: Of the 10 participants in the SLI, 1 (10.0%) participant achieved a confirmed CR, and 5 (50.0%) participants achieved a confirmed PR, therefore, the confirmed BMRR was 60.0% (90% CI: 30.4, 85.0; 95% CI: 26.2, 87.8). Pharmacokinetic Results: All 13 participants (10 in the SLI and 3 in Phase 2) were included in the PK set. However, the 3 participants in Phase 2 were split into Cohort 1 (n=1, prior therapy) and Cohort 2 (n=2, no prior therapy), and sampling was not sufficient to support noncompartmental analysis in any patient. As a result, only PK data from the 10 participants in the SLI arm are presented and discussed. Plasma Concentrations of Encorafenib and LHY746 Following repeated twice-daily oral administration of encorafenib 300 mg during Cycle 1, on Day 15 mean plasma concentrations of encorafenib were notably lower across the entire PK profile compared with those observed on Day 1 indicative of net autoinduction of encorafenib as has been previously noted; conversely, for the metabolite the mean plasma concentrations were notably higher across the entire PK profile on Cycle 1 Day 15 compared to Day 1. Visual inspection of the plasma trough concentrations versus study day profiles indicated that steady state plasma exposures for encorafenib and its metabolite were generally achieved by Day 15 of dosing. Plasma Concentrations of Binimetinib and AR00426032 Following repeated twice-daily oral administration of binimetinib 45 mg during Cycle 1, on Day 15 mean plasma concentrations of binimetinib and its metabolite AR00426032 were lower across the entire PK profile compared with those observed on Day 1. Visual inspection of the plasma trough concentrations versus study day profiles indicated that steady state plasma exposure to binimetinib and its metabolite was generally achieved by Day 15.

Conclusion(s): Efficacy:  Brain metastasis assessment: o The SLI cohort had a confirmed BMRR of 60.0% (90% CI: 30.4, 85.0; 95% CI: 26.2, 87.8), a DCR of 100% (95% CI: 69.2, 100), and a median DOR of 3.3 months (95% CI: 2.8 to 8.5 months); o The Phase 2 portion had a confirmed BMRR of 66.7% (90% CI: 13.5, 98.3; 95% CI: 9.4, 99.2), a DCR of 100% (95% CI: 29.2, 100), and a median DOR of 5.6 months (95% CI: 5.0 to 6.2 months).  The confirmed extracranial response rate according to RECIST v1.1 per Investigator assessment was 60.0% (90% CI: 30.4, 85.0; 95% CI: 26.2, 87.8) with a DCR of 70% (95% CI: 34.8, 93.3) in the SLI, and was 100% (90% CI: 36.8, 100; 95% CI: 29.2, 100) with a DCR of 100% (95% CI: 29.2, 100) in Phase 2.  Global tumor assessment: o The SLI cohort had a confirmed global response rate of 50.0% (90% CI: 22.2, 77.8; 95% CI: 18.7, 81.3), a DCR of 90% (95% CI: 55.5, 99.7), and a median DOR of 2.9 months (95% CI: 2.8 to 8.5 months); o The Phase 2 portion had a confirmed global response rate of 100% (90% CI: 36.8, 100; 95% CI: 29.2, 100), a DCR of 100% (95% CI: 29.2, 100), and a median DOR of 5.0 months (95% CI: 3.9 to 6.2 months). PK:  The reduced exposure to encorafenib and high accumulation of LHY746 at steady state after repeated dosing of encorafenib 300 mg BID were observed. The reduced exposure to binimetinib and AR00426032 at steady state after repeated dosing of binimetinib 45 mg BID was observed in this study. Safety:  In the SLI, 3 out of 9 participants (33.3%) in the dose-determining set experienced a DLT therefore deeming the high dose regimen of encorafenib 300 mg BID and binimetinib 45 mg BID not well tolerated.  In Phase 2, the safety profile was generally consistent with the known safety profile of the standard dose combination. No new safety signals were identified.
