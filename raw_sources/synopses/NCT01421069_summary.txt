METHODS Study Design: This was an open label, single treatment, multicenter, 8-year extension study in pediatric participants who had been diagnosed with one of 3 subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA): extended oligoarticular JIA (eoJIA), enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Participants who had received at least 1 dose of etanercept and completed approximately 96 weeks of participation in the parent study (Study B1801014) were asked to participate in this extension study (Study B1801023). This 96-month study comprised 3 periods: 1. Active Treatment Period: Participants who had completed approximately 96 weeks of active treatment with the investigational product (IP), etanercept, in the parent study and were eligible to continue etanercept in the extension study entered directly into the active treatment period. 2. Withdrawal/Re-Treatment Period: The withdrawal/re-treatment period was optional, and the investigator and participant could determine when the participant was to be withdrawn from study treatment.  Withdrawal: Participants who either had completed approximately 96 weeks of treatment in the parent study, or were enrolled in the active treatment period of the extension study and who either met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Wallace definition for clinically inactive disease (CID) for at least 6 months on etanercept, or who, in the investigator’s judgment had a good clinical response and were likely to benefit from withdrawal from etanercept, and were otherwise eligible, could enter the withdrawal/re-treatment period.  Re-Treatment: Participants requiring re-treatment per the investigator’s clinical judgment and who were otherwise eligible were offered the option to restart treatment with etanercept. 3. Observational Period: All participants were to be followed for a total of 8 years from the time of initial entry into the extension study. This included:  Participants who discontinued etanercept prior to completing 96 weeks of active treatment in the parent study and were not permitted to restart etanercept in the extension study;  Participants who participated in the withdrawal period in the extension study and were ineligible for re-treatment with etanercept or subsequently discontinued the re-treatment. Participants enrolled in the observational period were not permitted to resume etanercept treatment for the remaining time in the extension study. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Participants diagnosed with one of 3 JIA subtypes (eoJIA, ERA, or PsA) who received at least 1 dose of etanercept and participated for approximately 96 weeks in the parent study, and who fulfilled the selection criteria for the extension study were enrolled in the appropriate study period as follows:  Participants were enrolled in the active treatment period if in the investigator’s judgment this was appropriate, provided their first dose of etanercept in this study was administered within 6 weeks of receiving the last dose of etanercept in the parent study.  Participants were enrolled in the withdrawal/re-treatment period if they met the Wallace definition for CID for at least 6 months on etanercept, or in the investigator’s judgment had a good clinical response and would benefit from withdrawal from etanercept, provided the baseline visit was completed within 14 days of the last dose of etanercept in the parent study.  Participants were asked to participate in the observational period if they withdrew from the active treatment period and were not eligible to enroll in the withdrawal/re-treatment period. Study Treatment: Etanercept dose was based on the participant’s weight and age at the previous visit; and adjustments, including increases and decreases to the dose were made as necessary. 1. Participants aged <18 years and ≤62 kg receive etanercept at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg once per week (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg) for up to 96 months; 2. Participants aged ≥18 years or >62 kg receive etanercept subcutaneously at a dose of 50 mg once per week.

Time to flare was defined as from start day of withdrawal period to the day of flare. Time to retreatment was defined as from start day of withdrawal period to the day treatment is restarted. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Evaluations: No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic evaluations were done in this study. Safety Evaluations: Safety data were cumulative and included combined data for all participants collected over 2 years of the parent study and 8 years of the extension study.  The primary endpoint was occurrence of malignancy over the course of the study for all participants.  Secondary safety endpoints for participants in all 3 study periods were occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs), including serious infections, and occurrence of medically important infections (defined as an infection requiring hospitalization and/or parenteral anti-infective agents);  Safety endpoints for participants in the active and withdrawal/re-treatment periods were occurrence of adverse events (AEs), including infections, infections considered preventable by vaccination, and injection site reactions (ISRs), withdrawals from etanercept treatment due to AEs, laboratory evaluations, growth parameters, and Tanner Stage assessment. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: All analyses were performed for the overall population as well as each of the 3 JIA subtype populations of eoJIA, ERA, and PsA participants. The sample size for this safety extension protocol, as agreed upon with regulatory authorities, was not based on efficacy considerations; rather, all eligible participants who either completed or discontinued from the parent study were asked to participate in the extension study. For the overall population as well as each of the JIA subpopulations, descriptive statistics were provided for each study endpoint at each time point in the study. For categorical endpoints, the summary statistics contained the frequency, percentage, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the percentage. For continuous endpoints, the summary statistics contained the number of observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, maximum, and 95% CI of the mean for both raw data and the change from baseline. The observed cases (OC) analysis, ie, without imputation for missing data, was the focus of the efficacy summaries. The baseline visit from parent study was used for the calculation of change from baseline results where applicable. Exploratory endpoints for participants in the withdrawal/re-treatment period were analyzed as above and summarized for all participants entering the withdrawal/re-treatment period as well as separately for those participants who did or did not meet the Wallace definition for CID prior to withdrawal. In addition, for those participants who met the Wallace criteria for CID at the time of withdrawal from etanercept, the time in CID while off treatment was assessed. The CHAQ and HAQ were summarized in the same way as the efficacy endpoints. The CHAQ and HAQ results were summarized separately. Safety: The incidence of malignancies, SAEs, serious infections, and medically important infections were summarized as frequency and percentage, as well as adjusted rate per 100 patient-years of exposure (EP100PY) to etanercept along with 95% CI. In addition to showing cumulative rates over the entire study period (including both parent and extension studies), rates were also categorized by year. Safety presentations were provided for overall populations and by each JIA subtype population; separate summaries for participants in the active treatment period, withdrawal/re- treatment period and the observational period were also provided. For participants in the active treatment period and withdrawal/re-treatment periods, the occurrence of all AEs (including infections), infections considered preventable by vaccination, and ISRs as well as treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), potentially clinically important laboratory measurements, and premature discontinuations during the study were summarized using frequency and percentage, as well as adjusted rate per EP100PY of exposure to etanercept. AEs were classified according to system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) on Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 23.1. For laboratory data, vital sign measurements, and other continuous safety data, the number of observations, mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum, and 95% CI of the mean were summarized by visit for raw data and the change from baseline. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and Tanner scores were summarized using the number of observations, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum by age group. Height, weight, and BMI were also compared with data from standardized growth charts. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: In the parent study (Study B1801014), a total of 127 participants had been enrolled and had received at least 1 dose of IP. In this extension study (Study B1801023), a total of 109 participants from the parent study were enrolled and were included in the full analysis set (FAS): 55 eoJIA participants, 31 ERA participants, and 23 PsA participants. Of the 109 participants, 10 participants from the parent study directly entered the observational period of the extension study. At the time of database release, 25 (22.9%) participants had permanently discontinued the study prematurely while 84 (77.1%) participants completed the study (Figure 1). CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Figure 1 Participant Disposition Participation status of 109 participants at database release Note: Total discontinued is the sum of individual reasons since they are mutually exclusive by participant. a Two (2) participants were discontinued at the investigator’s discretion. Efficacy Results: Secondary Efficacy Analysis ACR Pedi Response (Observed cases) In the overall population >95% of the participants achieved ACR Pedi 30 response at all study time points. All (100%) participants stably achieved ACR Pedi 30, ACR Pedi 50, and ACR Pedi 70 response from Month 54 onwards, except for up to 2 participants at certain time points. At Month 96, ACR Pedi 90 and ACR Pedi 100 responses were achieved by 86.7% and 77.8% of the overall population, respectively. The improvements in mean values for each individual ACR Pedi response variable (OC data) were generally maintained for all JIA subtype populations allowing for slight variations. According to the PGA, the disease activity had decreased by 89.4% in the overall population at Month 96 compared with parent study baseline. In general, a progressive decrease in disease activity compared with parent study was seen in all participants in terms of ACR Pedi response, regardless of the JIA subtype or age group. Pain Assessment (VAS) The mean pain assessment scores decreased progressively in all JIA subtype populations. At Month 96 the mean percentage change from parent study baseline was a decrease of 84.3% in the overall population and a decrease of 79.4%, 87.4%, and 89.3%, in the eoJIA, ERA, and PsA subtype populations, respectively. Morning Stiffness Duration The mean ± SD duration of morning stiffness in the overall population was 1.74 ± 4.16 minutes at Month 96 and showed variations across study time points and across JIA subtype populations. At Month 96 the mean percentage change from parent study in morning stiffness duration was a decrease of 84.8% in the overall population and a decrease of 76.8%, 99.7%, and 80.0% in the eoJIA, ERA, and PsA subtype populations, respectively. In the JIA subtype populations, the mean changes from parent study were generally similar across the study time points, allowing for variations. Clinically Inactive Disease Status The number (%) of participants with CID status (defined according to the ACR Wallace criteria) showed variations across Month 6 to Month 96 and across JIA subtype populations. At Month 96, CID status was recorded in overall 26.1% of the participants, with 30.0%, 12.5%, and 40.0% in the eoJIA, ERA, and PsA subtype populations, respectively. JADAS The JADAS varied across the time points and JIA subtype populations throughout the study. At Month 96, the mean ± SD JADAS in the overall population was 2.05 ± 2.55. There was a decrease in the disease activity compared with parent study baseline; however, there were wide variations observed across study time points and within the JIA subtype populations. Overall And Nocturnal Back Pain Scores In ERA Participants Overall back pain scores in the ERA participants varied across time points throughout the study. At Month 96, the mean ± SD overall back pain score was 3.75 ± 5.82, which represented a mean (%) change from parent study baseline of −20.84 (−15.9%). Nocturnal back pain scores in the ERA participants also varied across time points throughout the study. At Month 96, the mean ± SD score was 4.50 ± 9.35, which represented a mean (%) change from parent study of −22.49 (758.0%). BASMI Scores in ERA Participants There was a gradual improvement in the individual components of the BASMI score and the total score during the study. The mean BASMI total score decreased from 0.39 at Month 12 to 0.00 at Month 96. Percentage BSA Affected By Psoriasis And PGA Of Psoriasis In Psa Participants Percentage of BSA affected by psoriasis in the PsA subtype population decreased across study time points and at Month 96 the mean ± SD value was 0.80 ± 1.10%, which represented a mean (%) change from parent study of −15.80% (−74.5%). The PGA scores for reduction in psoriasis were stable across the study time point and at Month 96 the mean (%) change from parent study baseline was −1.80 (−68.3%). Health Outcomes The proportion of participants with clinically important improvement in CHAQ scores compared with parent study baseline increased over time, reaching 100% from Month 54 up to Month 96; however, this outcome should be interpreted with caution due to the lower number of participants evaluated at the later time points. The data on HAQ scores were sparse until the end of the study. Time to Flare from Withdrawal and Time to Re-Treatment From Withdrawal For the overall population, the median time to flare from withdrawal was estimated as 190 (95% CI: 90, NA) days, and the median time to re-treatment from withdrawal was estimated as 274 (95% CI: 106, NA) days. However, due to the small number of data points, these results should be interpreted with caution. In summary, disease symptom scores and disease activity assessment showed variations across study time points but were similar within each JIA subtype population, and showed an overall improvement compared with the parent study baseline. Improvements in clinical status achieved in the parent study, were generally maintained for all efficacy endpoints up to the end of this extension study allowing for slight variations; however, due to the smaller sample sizes at later time points, these results should be interpreted with caution. The results of this extension study demonstrate that etanercept is effective in the treatment of 3 JIA subtype populations under study. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, Immunogenicity and/or Other Results: (Not Applicable) No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic evaluations were done in this study. Safety Results: Safety data were cumulative and included combined data for all participants collected in the parent study (2 years) and extension study (8 years), over a period of approximately 10 years. Primary Analysis: The primary endpoint in this extension study was the occurrence of malignancy over the course of the study. Up to the database release date of 03 March 2021, 1 malignancy was reported. participant with eoJIA, who started etanercept treatment on study experienced an SAE of Hodgkin’s disease during the active treatment period of the extension study. There were no relevant risk factors for malignancy, and the participant had On (Day 132 of the extension study), the participant presented with a mediastinal mass and a swollen lymph node at the side of neck. A biopsy of lymph nodes confirmed Hodgkin’s lymphoma of nodular sclerosis type, with a supraventricular mass and a high anterior mediastinal mass. A bone marrow biopsy showed suspicion of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The participant received , at 4 weekly cycles of chemotherapy starting from considered the event to be related to the IP and concomitant methotrexate. The participant withdrew consent and was permanently discontinued from the study on No further information has since been received regarding this event. No malignancy was reported during the withdrawal/re treatment or observational periods of the study. A summary of number of participants with AEs, infections, and ISRs is presented in Table S3.

In Study B1801014, 1 additional event of Crohn’s disease was reported but was not considered treatment-emergent based on missing data for the last dose. Classification of AEs was based on MedDRA v23.1. Adverse Events by Causality and Severity AEs (excluding infections and ISRs; including non-treatment emergent AEs) considered as IP-related were reported in 28 (22.0%) participants. The majority of the IP-related TEAEs were of mild (9.4% participants) or moderate (10.2% participants) severity. IP-related severe disease in 1 participant; uveitis in another participant; and colitis, Crohn’s disease, intestinal perforation, and pneumoperitoneum in the third participant. Injection Site Reactions Overall, at least 1 ISR was reported in 16 (12.60%) participants comprising of 8 (13.33%) eoJIA participants, 6 (15.79%) ERA participants, and 2 (6.90%) PsA participants. A total of 64 ISRs were reported corresponding to a total of 142 ISR symptoms, including 59 ISR symptoms of redness. The number of ISRs per injection was <0.00. Infections At least 1 treatment-emergent infection was reported in 108 (85.0%) participants in the overall population, comprising of 53 (88.3%) eoJIA participants, 31 (81.6%) ERA participants, and 24 (82.8%) PsA participants. The highest exposure-adjusted rate (by PT) of treatment-emergent infections reported in this category was for upper respiratory tract infections at 24.59 EP100PY with 168 events. Majority of the treatment-emergent infections were not IP-related and were of mild or moderate severity. Treatment-emergent infections considered IP-related were reported in 29 (22.8%) participants, including severe infections of appendicitis and peritonitis in 1 eoJIA participant, and septic shock in another eoJIA participant. Permanent Discontinuations from Study Treatment Due to Adverse Events or Infections In the overall population, 14 (11.0%) participants were withdrawn from the IP treatment due to TEAEs (excluding infections and ISRs), included Crohn’s disease reported in 3 participants (2.4%), iridocyclitis and uveitis reported in 2 participants (1.6%) each; and other TEAEs reported in 1 (0.8%) participant each, including Hodgkin’s disease among others. Infections causing IP withdrawal were bronchopneumonia, pyelocystitis, and sepsis that were reported in 1 participant each. Of these, bronchopneumonia and pyelocystitis were reported in Year 1 in the parent study. Serious Adverse Events and Serious Infections No deaths were reported in the parent or extension studies. At least 1 treatment-emergent SAE (excluding infections and ISRs) was reported in 30 (23.6%) participants corresponding to an exposure-adjusted rate of 40 (5.85 EP100PY) events. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent SAE (by PT) was Crohn’s disease (3 events). At least 1 treatment-emergent serious infection was reported in 11 (8.7%) participants. The only treatment-emergent serious infection reported more than once during the study was gastroenteritis that was reported twice. Other Significant Adverse Events No cases of active tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, blood dyscrasias, or demyelinating disorders were reported in the extension study up to the database release. Infections Considered Preventable by Vaccination Among the participants with a prior history of vaccination, 1 eoJIA participant experienced a rubella infection in Year 1 in the parent study. Among the participants with no history of vaccination, 21 (16.5%) participants experienced an infection considered preventable by vaccination, including influenza and varicella infection that were reported in 11 (8.7%) participants and 8 (6.3%) participants, respectively. Gastrointestinal Disorders and Crohn’s disease In the overall population, TEAEs coded to the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders were reported in 39 (30.7%) participants, and the most frequent were diarrhea in 12 (9.4%) participants; and nausea and abdominal pain in 9 (7.1%) participants. Altogether 3 treatment-emergent events of Crohn’s disease were reported and led to participant withdrawal, 2 events in ERA participants, and 1 event in a participant with eoJIA. Of these, 1 event was considered severe and IP related. No events of ulcerative colitis were reported. Autoimmune Disorders Treatment-emergent autoimmune disorders were reported in 14 (11.0%) participants; and were iridocyclitis reported in 7 (5.5%) participants, uveitis in 6 (4.7%) participants, and Crohn’s disease in 3 (2.4%) participants. Clinical Laboratory Findings Grade 3 severity abnormalities of increases in alanine aminotransferase and total neutrophils were reported in 1 participant each in the eoJIA and ERA subtype populations, respectively. No Grade 4 laboratory test result was reported for any participant in this study. No Hy’s Law cases have been reported during the study. Mean changes from baseline in clinical safety laboratory test results over time were unremarkable. Vital Signs Findings Overall, 19 (19.2%) participants had a vital sign result of potential clinical importance. Of these, 14 (14.1%) participants had high systolic blood pressure, 2 (2.0%) participants had high diastolic blood pressure, and 4 (4.0%) participants had low diastolic blood pressure. The height, weight, BMI, and Tanner stage scores all showed increases over time. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic There was a low level impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on this study. Out of the 13 participants that were in the study during the COVID-19 pandemic, 1 case of suspected COVID-19 infection was reported in 1 PsA participant. The infection was considered as moderate, not IP-related, and the event resolved before study completion. The participant could no longer continue in the study due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and hence was withdrawn from the study. COVID-19-related protocol deviations were mostly minor, except for the potentially important protocol deviations reported in 3 participants, all related to study visit or procedures not being completed. The safety results from the entire study periods of the parent and extension study were consistent with the results of the 3 biennial interim analyses. The safety profile of etanercept in this study was favorable and consistent with the known safety profile of this drug. There were no unexpected safety findings or new safety signals. Conclusions: Over the period of 10 years of the parent and extension studies combined, 1 case of malignancy (Hodgkin’s disease) was reported in a total of 127 participants treated with etanercept. The overall rate of SAEs and serious infections was low. This Final Clinical Study Report for the long-term extension study, Study B1801023, supports the conclusions of the parent study, Study B1801014, that etanercept is well tolerated. There were no unexpected safety findings or new safety signals. The safety profile continues to be similar to that observed in previous JIA studies and consistent with the overall known safety profile of this drug. Treatment responses were considered to be clinically meaningful and durable with continued long-term treatment. In conclusion, the benefit-risk assessment of etanercept in the 3 JIA subtype populations studied remained favorable.
