Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints a. The assessment of clinical remission will utilize the current definition of the traditional Mayo endoscopic subscore, which allows for assessment of mild friability in the subscore of 1. b. The Central Readers for endoscopy Mayo subscores also employed an assessment as to the presence or absence of any friability (including mild). In this assessment the presence of any friability (including mild) was scored as 2 (modified endoscopic subscore). METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study in participants with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and a non-remission (partial) response to anti- tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- therapy. Each participant was randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms (1 active; 1 placebo) with projected enrollment of 76 participants (38 participants per arm) to achieve a total of 64 evaluable participants. As The study design schematic was presented in Figure S1. Figure S1. Study Design Schematic Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Male and/or female participants were 18 years to 75 years of age and weight >40 kg at the time of informed consent (For participants in South Korea: male and/or female 19 years to <70 years of age and weight >40 kg at the time of informed consent.).  A diagnosis of active UC (histologic) for ≥4 months.  Participants who had partial response to anti-TNF (infliximab) and active UC as defined by (via screening endoscopy) a total Mayo Score 4 but 9 and an endoscopic subscore 2.  UC extending at least 15 cm proximal to the anal verge at the time of the screening endoscopy  Must be on a stable dose 5 to 10 mg/kg of Remicade®, or protocol-specified infliximab biosimilars for a minimum of 14 weeks prior to study entry with no anticipation of need for change in infliximab treatment regimen throughout the study. Study Treatment: During the study, Remicade or protocol-specified infliximab biosimilar approved for treatment of UC was administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion using a calibrated infusion pump by investigator site personnel on Day 1, Week 8 and Week 16 for a total of 3 doses for participants on infliximab every 8 weeks, and Day 1, Week 6, Week 12 and Week 18 for participants on infliximab every 6 weeks. PF-06687234 was administered as a 20 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection by the blinded investigator site personnel on Day 1, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, Week 6, Week 7, Week 8, Week 9, Week 10 and Week 11 for a total 12 doses.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Proportion of participants with endoscopic improvement at Week 12. Endoscopic Improvement: decrease of ≥1 point in Mayo endoscopy score or an absolute endoscopy score of ≤1 without friability. Mean change from baseline at Week 12 in Geboes histology score. Colon biopsies obtained histological activity grading system referred to as “Geboes” which had demonstrated good reproducibility, was utilized by a central reader and was the basis for assessing histological changes pre and post treatment. Proportion of participants with a clinical response at Week 12. Clinical response: decrease from baseline of at least 3 points in total Mayo score with at least 30% change, accompanied by at least one-point decrease or absolute score of 0 or 1 in rectal bleeding subscore. Total Mayo Score: The Mayo Score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for UC. The Mayo scoring system ranges from 0 to 12 points and consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy, and physician’s global assessment), each graded 0 to 3 with the higher score indicating more severe disease activity. Proportion of participants with change from baseline in partial Mayo Score of 2 with no individual subscore >1 at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12. Partial Mayo Score: Mayo Score without endoscopic subscore, ranging from 0 to 9. Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Evaluations: Pharmacokinetics Blood samples (4 mL) to provide a minimum of approximately 1.5 mL serum for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of PF-06687234 were collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K EDTA) at pre-specified 2 time points. Immunogenicity To characterize immunogenicity against PF-06687234, blood samples (12 mL) to provide approximately 8 mL plasma for human anti fusion antibody (HAFA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) analyses were collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing K EDTA 2 at pre-specified time points. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Efficacy The primary endpoint was analyzed using exact Chan and Zhang method. The difference between treatment groups in the proportion of participants in remission at Week 12 was presented along with its 95% confidence interval. The binary secondary endpoints, such as the proportion of participants achieving endoscopic improvements or the proportion of participants achieving clinical response, were analyzed using the same approach as described for the primary endpoint. For continuous secondary endpoints that were only measured at baseline and Week 12, such as change from baseline at Week 12 in Geboes histology score was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group and baseline scores. For binary/continuous secondary endpoints that were measured repeatedly over time, such as proportions of participants with partial Mayo Score of 2 with no individual subscore >1, was analyzed using generalized linear mixed effect model with treatment group, visit, treatment group by visit interaction and participants as the random effect. An unstructured covariance matrix was assumed. Pharmacokinetics PK concentrations were summarized and presented with summary statistics. Immunogenicity Overall incidence of development of HAFA and of NAb were reported along with relationships of incidence with respect to time. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 20 participants (10 in each group) were enrolled and treated. Fifteen (75.0%) participants completed the treatment; 8 in the placebo group and 7 in the PF-06687234 group (Table S3). A total of 5 participants discontinued study treatment. Efficacy Results: Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants in modified clinical remission at Week 12. The assessment of clinical remission utilized 2 definitions of Mayo endoscopic subscore and are both presented below.  Traditional endoscopic subscore ≤ 1 (where mild friability was scored as of 1; moderate or severe friability was scored as 2):  In the PF-06687234 treatment group, 14.3% of participants achieved modified clinical remission at Week 12; in the placebo group, 12.5% of participants achieved such response when missing values were handled by observed cases (OC, Table S4). No significant difference was observed between the 2 treatment groups.  In both PF-06687234 and placebo groups, 10.0% of participants each achieved modified clinical remission at Week 12 when missing values were handled by treatment failure approach (TFA, Table S5). No difference was observed between the 2 treatment groups.  Endoscopy subscore = 0 or 1 (where any friability was scored as a mayo endoscopic  In the PF-06687234 treatment group, 14.3% of participants achieved modified clinical remission at Week 12; in the placebo group, none of the participants achieved such response when missing values were handled by OC (Table S6). However, there was no significant difference observed between the 2 treatment groups.  In the PF-06687234 treatment group, 10.0% of participants achieved modified clinical remission at Week 12; in the placebo group, none of the participants achieved such response when missing values were handled by TFA (Table S7). However, there was no significant difference observed between the 2 treatment groups. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Secondary Endpoints Proportion of Participants With Endoscopic Improvement at Week 12 In the PF-06687234 treatment group, 57.1% of participants achieved endoscopic improvement at Week 12; in the placebo group, 25.0% of participants achieved such response when missing values were handled by OC. A numerically higher proportion of participants achieved endoscopic improvement in the PF-06687234 group compared to the placebo group, but no significant difference was observed. In the PF-06687234 treatment group, 40.0% of participants achieved endoscopic improvement at Week 12; in the placebo group, 20.0% of participants achieved such response when missing values were handled by TFA. A numerically higher proportion of participants achieved endoscopic improvement in the PF-06687234 group compared to the placebo group, but no significant difference was observed. Mean Change From Baseline in Geboes and Robart’s Index Histology Score at Week 12 At Week 12, no statistically significant differences were observed in proportion of participants achieving Geboes index remission, Robart’s histology index remission or Geboes deep remission between the 2 treatment groups. Generally, Robart’s histology indexes in both treatment groups decreased at Week 12 compared to those at baseline. However, there was generally no difference between the 2 treatment groups. Proportion of Participants With a Clinical Response at Week 12 At Week 12, a numerically higher proportion of participants achieved clinical response in the PF-06687234 group (85.7%) compared to the placebo group (37.5%) when missing values were handled by OC, but no statistically significant difference was observed. Consistent results were observed when missing values were handled by TFA, 60.0% of participants in the PF-06687234 group achieved clinical response at Week 12; 30.0% of participants in the placebo group achieved such response at Week 12. However, no statistically significant difference was observed. Proportion of Participants With Change From Baseline in Partial Mayo Score of ≤2 with No Individual Subscore >1 at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 Generally, no significant differences were observed in proportion of participants achieving change from baseline in partial Mayo score of ≤2 with no individual subscore >1 at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 between the 2 treatment groups. Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Results: Pharmacokinetics Individual PF-06687234 concentration-time profiles for the 2 participants in the PK subgroup are presented in Figure S2 (linear plot only) for Day 1 and Week 11. The concentration values of participants who did not participate in PK substudy are presented in Table S8. Figure S2. Individual Serum PF-06687234 Concentration-Time Profiles on Day 1 (Upper Panel) and Week 11 (Lower Panel) Following Weekly SC Dosing of PF-06687234 20 mg + Infliximab, Study B7581002 Immunogenicity No participants had positive response at baseline. Following the administration of treatment, a few participants developed the anti PF-06687234 antibody and none of them tested positive for anti PF-06687234 IL-10 neutralizing antibody. Two participants tested positive for the anti PF-06687234 single chain variable fragment (scFv) NAb at Week 7 and the positive response was no longer detectable since Week 11. Safety Results: In the placebo group, 8 (80.0%) participants had 16 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported, of which, 2 were considered to be treatment-related and reported in 1 (10.0%) participant. Two (20.0%) participants discontinued study drug due to AEs and continued in the study. Two (20.0%) participants had severe TEAEs (1 participant had a severe SAE of colitis ulcerative and 1 participant had severe NSAEs of colitis ulcerative and acne). One (10.0%) participant temporarily discontinued due to AEs. None of the TEAEs were reported by more than 1 participant except for colitis ulcerative (3 [30.0%] participants) and headache (2 [20.0%] participants). In the PF-06687234 group, 9 (90.0%) participants had 29 TEAEs reported, of which, 8 were considered to be treatment-related and reported in 7 (70.0%) participants. One (10.0%) participant discontinued study drug due to AEs and continued in the study. One (10.0%) participant temporarily discontinued due to AEs. The most frequently reported TEAE was injection site reaction (3 [30.0%] participants) which were all considered to be treatment-related. Most of the TEAEs were reported by single participants. The incidence of TEAEs was comparable between 2 groups. The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity. There were no deaths in this study. One participant in the placebo group had a serious adverse event (SAE) of colitis ulcerative. Two participants had other significant AEs (anaemia and thrombocytopenia) reported. Eighteen (90.0%) participants (9 in each group) had laboratory test abnormalities. The most frequently reported abnormalities were leukocyte esterase ≥1 (7 [35.0%] participants). Nine participants had vital signs data meeting categorical criteria. The most frequently reported finding was sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) change ≥ 20 mmHg decrease (5 [25.0%] participants). None of the findings were considered to be clinically significant. One participant in the PF-06687234 group had corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) change ≥ 30-<60 msec. This finding was not considered to be clinically significant. Conclusions: Efficacy: Generally, no significant difference was observed in participants achieving efficacy improvement (modified clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, decreases in histology scores, clinical response and decreases in Mayo scores) between the PF-06687234-treated group and placebo-treated group. PK: Only 2 participants were included in the PK subgroup. Individual PK parameters varied greatly between the 2 participants. Immunogenicity: Generally, there were no differences in anti-PF-06687234 response between PF-06687234- and placebo-treated groups. There was no participant with positive NAb against IL-10. Safety: PF-06687234 was safe and well-tolerated. There were no new safety findings in participants treated with combination of PF-06687234 and infliximab. There were no deaths, generally no difference in SAEs, severe AEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation between the 2 treatment groups. The most frequently reported AE in the PF-06687234 group was injection site reaction.
