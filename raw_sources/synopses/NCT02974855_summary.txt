Through Day 29 (at a minimum), data were reviewed to determine if PF-06741086 was safe and well-tolerated. Dosing of participants in any cohort was to be stopped if the protocol-specified stopping criteria were met, or if available data indicated that the current dose was not safe and well-tolerated. If available safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) data through Day 29 were permissive for dose escalation, a cohort at a higher dose level was to be opened for enrollment. Alternatively, a cohort at a lower dose level was to be opened if data were supportive. In addition, if the dose level under review was safe and well tolerated through Day 29, treatment was to continue for the participants in that respective cohort during the subsequent 2 months (Day 30 to Day 85). Participants in the SC cohorts were to receive treatment on Day 36, Day 43, Day 50, Day 57, Day 64, Day 71, Day 78, follow-up on Day 85, and end-of-study procedures on Day 113. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Individuals with severe hemophilia A or B (Factor VIII [FVIII] or FIX activity 1%) with an episodic (on-demand) treatment regimen, including participants with inhibitors to FVIII or FIX, were eligible to be recruited into this study. Eligible participants were required to have at least 6 acute bleeding episodes (spontaneous/traumatic) during the 6-month period prior to screening. Individuals with coronary artery, thrombotic, ischemic disease, or pro-thrombotic condition(s), or receiving treatment for acute bleeding episodes with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) (eg, factor eight inhibitor bypass agent [FEIBA]) at the time of study enrollment and not able to substitute treatment with recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa) for the duration of the study, were not eligible for this study. Study Treatment: The investigational product description is provided in Table 2. Participants were treated with PF-06741086 SC dosed weekly for up to 3 months, with a maximum of 5 months expected for overall duration of study participation. Table 2. Investigational Product Description Investigational Product Strength/Potency Dosage Description Form PF-06741086 Solution for 100 mg/mL Solution Injection, 100 mg/mL Efficacy Evaluations: Frequency and annualized rate of bleeding episodes from Day 1 up to Day 85 is the key secondary endpoint in the study (Table 1). Information on bleeding episodes over the 6 months prior to the study was collected at screening. Information on new bleeding episodes was collected continuously from screening to Day 113 (follow-up/end of study). Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Immunogenicity Evaluations: Pharmacokinetics Refer to Table 1 for the PK endpoints evaluated in the study. Blood samples (4.5 mL) providing approximately 1.5 mL plasma for PK analysis were collected at pre-specified time points. PK blood samples were assayed for PF-06741086 using a validated, sensitive and specific electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method. The following PF-06741086 PK parameters (Table 3) were calculated for each participant and each dose cohort, as applicable, using non-compartmental analysis of concentration-time data. Maximum observed concentration at steady state (C ), and time to reach maximum max,ss concentration at steady state (T ), planned to be evaluated (Table 1), were not calculated max,ss as the steady state was not achieved in Week 5 (Days 29 to 35). Maximum plasma concentration (C ) and time for C (T ) were calculated for Week 5 instead. max max max Table 3.

Data points were excluded if there was a dose missed within 4 weeks prior to Day 85 (Week 13). Pharmacodynamics Refer to Table 1 for the pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints evaluated in the study. Blood samples providing plasma for total tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) level, thrombin generation (TGA), prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, D-dimer and dilute prothrombin time analyses were collected at pre-specified time points. PD blood samples were assayed for PD markers using validated analytical methods. Immunogenicity Frequency of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) production against PF-06741086 from Day 1 up to Day 113 was a secondary endpoint in the study (Table 1). Blood samples (9.0 mL) providing approximately 3.0 mL plasma for ADA and NAb analysis, were collected at pre-specified time points. Immunogenicity blood samples were assayed for ADA and NAb using validated semi-quantitative ECL methods. Safety Evaluations: Refer to Table 1 for the safety endpoints evaluated in the study. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) 2007 severity scale was utilized to grade treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) severity. Adverse events (AEs) reported as Grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 in severity corresponded to mild, moderate, severe and life-threatening AEs, respectively. Statistical Methods: Efficacy Baseline for annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was defined as the ABR during the 6 months prior to study enrollment. The efficacy analysis was conducted in the Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS), which was a subset of the Safety Analysis Set (SAS) and excluded participants with major protocol deviations (eg, lack of compliance in study drug administration and/or violations on concomitant medications). The SAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. A historical On Demand group was constructed using the following internal Pfizer studies: ReFacto AF 3082B2-4432 (B1831004), BeneFIX B1821010, and BeneFIX 3090A1-400 (B1821004). Participants who were on On Demand treatment in B1831004, as well as data from the On Demand period in B1821004 and B1821010 were used to construct the historical On Demand group. The resulting dataset were further filtered to match the key inclusion/exclusion criteria of B7841002 based on age and factor activity (18 age 65 and factor activity 1%). Outliers with extremely high ABR were removed from the pooled On Demand group, if appropriate. All resulting individuals were included in the historical control group. Prophylactic treatment with PF-06741086 was to be considered superior to On Demand treatment with respect to ABR reduction if:  The upper limit of the two-sided 80% confidence interval (CI) of the ratio of ABR in PF-06741086 versus historical On Demand group was <1; and  The estimate of the ratio of ABR in PF-06741086 versus historical On Demand group 0.3. Pharmacokinetics The PK parameter analysis was conducted in the PK Parameter Analysis Set, which included all enrolled and treated participants with at least one of the PK parameters. The PK concentration analysis was conducted in the PK Concentration Analysis Set, which included all enrolled and treated participants with at least 1 quantifiable PK concentration. Pharmacodynamics Baseline for PD endpoints was defined as the last measurement prior to dosing on Day 1. PD analysis was conducted in the PD Analysis Set, which included all enrolled participants receiving at least 1 dose of study treatment and with a baseline measurement and at least 1 post-dose measurement for at least 1 PD endpoint. Immunogenicity Immunogenicity analysis was performed based on the SAS. Only positive ADA samples and the corresponding baseline samples were tested in the NAb assay. Baseline was defined as the last measurement prior to dosing on Day 1. Frequencies of ADA and NAb were summarized by dose cohort and study day for samples collected. Safety Safety analysis was performed based on the SAS. No formal statistical analysis of safety was undertaken. Descriptive summaries were generated. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Table 4 summarizes participant disposition in this study. Thirty-eight (38) individuals were screened, of which, 11 individuals failed at screening. Among the 27 participants who met the eligibility criteria and were assigned to the study treatment, 26 (96.3%) participants were treated with PF-06741086, and 1 (3.7%) participant assigned to the PF-06741086 300 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort was not treated due to consent withdrawal prior to dosing on Day 1. Among 26 participants treated with PF-06741086, 24 (92.3%) participants completed the study, and 2 (7.7%) participants discontinued from study due to AEs. One (1) participant from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC loading + 150 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort discontinued from study due to a Grade 2 non-serious AE of hypertension, which was determined to be treatment related by the investigator. One (1) participant from the Grade 3 non-serious AE of decreased blood fibrinogen, which was determined to be treatment related by the investigator. All 26 participants were male. The majority of participants (19/26, 73.1%) were in the 18-44 age range. All 26 participants were of White (14/26, 53.8%) or Black/African American race (12/26, 46.2%). The median weight ranged from 61.60 kg (PF-06741086 300 mg SC loading + 150 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort) to 82.85 kg (PF-06741086 450 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort) and individual values ranged from 50.2 to 96.0 kg. The median body mass index (BMI) ranged from 21.26 kg/m2 (PF-06741086 300 mg SC loading + 150 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort) to 26.30 kg/m2 (PF-06741086 450 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort) and individual values ranged from 17.8 to 30.4 kg/m2. Among 26 treated participants, 23 (88.5%) participants had hemophilia A and 3 (11.5%) participants had hemophilia B. All 7 (100%) participants in the PF-06741086 300 mg SC QW inhibitor dose cohort had hemophilia A and inhibitors to FVIII. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Efficacy Results: ABR was defined by the following rules:  pre-treatment ABR = number of bleeding episodes within 6 months prior to study enrollment (total number of bleeding episodes in hemophilia history case report form [CRF]) × 2  on-study ABR = number of bleeding episodes occurred within 9 days after the last dose / ([last dose date + 9 - first dose date + 1] / 365.25) A negative binomial model was used to compare the ABR between PF-06741086 dose cohorts and the historical On Demand group. There was a statistically significant reduction in ABR in the pooled PF-06741086 dose cohorts (24 participants) versus that in the historical On Demand group (ratio [test/reference] = 0.10, 80% CI = 0.07 to 0.14, p <0.0001). The reduction in ABR remained statistically significant in each PF-06741086 dose cohort versus that in the historical On Demand group. A negative binomial model was also used to compare the on-study ABR and pre-treatment ABR in PF-06741086 dose cohorts. There was a statistically significant reduction in ABR in the on-study phase versus that in the pre-treatment phase in the pooled PF-06741086 dose cohorts (ratio [on-study/pre-treatment] = 0.14, 80% CI = 0.09 to 0.22, p <0.0001). The reduction in ABR in the on-study phase versus that in the pre-treatment phase remained statistically significant in each PF-06741086 dose cohort. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using an exact Wilcoxon-rank sum test. There was a statistically significant difference in ABR between the pooled PF-06741086 dose cohorts and the historical On Demand group (p <0.0001), and the difference remained statistically significant in each PF-06741086 dose cohort versus that in the historical On Demand group. There was a statistically significant difference between on-study and pre-treatment ABR in the pooled PF-06741086 dose cohorts (p <0.0001), and the difference remained statistically significant in each PF-06741086 dose cohort. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Immunogenicity Results: Pharmacokinetics PK parameters are summarized descriptively in Table 5. Following single-dose SC administration on Day 1, PF-06741086 C was reached with max median T values ranging from 69.7 to 71.6 hours across dose cohorts. In general, max PF-06741086 area under the concentration-time profile from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (C ) (AUC ) and C increased in a dose-related manner over last last max the 300 to 450 mg dose range tested on Day 1. PF-06741086 concentration increased with weekly dosing up to Day 29 over the 150 to 450 mg dose range tested. On Day 29 of multiple-dose SC administration, PF-06741086 appeared to be absorbed more rapidly with median T values of 22.8 to 58.5 hours across max dose cohorts, which might be related to limited sample collection times. In general, PF-06741086 area under the concentration-time profile from time 0 to time tau, the dosing interval (AUC ) and C increased in a dose-related manner over the 150 to 450 mg dose tau max range tested. PF-06741086 steady-state concentration generally appeared to have been reached by Day 57 based on similar concentration values on Days 57 and 85. The mean apparent clearance (CL/F) ranged from 32.43 to 45.34 mL/hr across dose cohorts following multiple SC doses. Overall variability for PF-06741086 exposure was moderate based on geometric percent coefficient of variation (%CV) and ranged from 37% to 79% for AUC (AUC and AUC ) last tau and 37% to 70% for C (Table 5). max It did not appear to be any apparent difference of PK between the hemophiliac participants with and without inhibitors following 300 mg SC QW dosing. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Pharmacodynamics Treatment-related changes were observed for all PD endpoints in all dose cohorts as expected. These changes included increases in total TFPI consistent with binding of free TFPI with PF-06741086, shortening of TGA lag time, increases in peak TGA level, increases in endogenous TGA potential level, increases in prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, increases in D-dimer, and shortening of dilute prothrombin time. There were no clinical findings suggesting that these PD changes were reflective of excessive pharmacology. PD responses were mostly consistent between inhibitor and non-inhibitor participants and between hemophilia A and B participants. Immunogenicity Among 26 participants treated with PF-06741086, no participants had positive ADA samples (titer 1.53) at baseline. The total incidence of treatment-induced ADA was 11.5% (3/26 participants). Four (4) samples from the 3 participants were confirmed ADA positive with titer ranging 1.72 to 2.89. Among these 3 participants positive for ADA, no participant tested positive for NAb. Safety Results: No thrombotic events were reported in the study. No deaths occurred in the study. There were 4 (15.4%) participants who experienced treatment-emergent serious AEs (SAEs) during the study, none of which were determined as treatment-related by the investigator or sponsor.  One (1) participant from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC loading + 150 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort had a Grade 2 SAE of physical assault.  One (1) participant from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC QW inhibitor dose cohort had a Grade 2 SAE of haemorrhage (bleeding from tooth).  One (1) participant from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort had a Grade 2 SAE of appendicitis. This participant experienced dose interruption from Day 35 to Day 62 due to this SAE.  One (1) participant from the PF-06741086 450 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort had a Grade 2 SAE of cholelithiasis. There were 56 all-causality treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) reported by 21 (80.8%) participants. Of these, 26 TEAEs were determined by the investigator as treatment related, and were reported in 14 (53.8%) participants. The majority of all-causality TEAEs were of Grade 1 (7/21 participants) or Grade 2 (10/21 participants) severity. No participants experienced Grade 4 TEAEs. The majority of treatment-related TEAEs (8/14 participants) were of Grade 1 severity. Four (4, 15.4%) participants experienced Grade 3 treatment-related AEs. Two (2) participants from the PF-06741086 450 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort had Grade 3 treatment-related TEAEs of injection site reaction (pain and swelling); 1 participant from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC QW inhibitor dose cohort had a Grade 3 treatment-related TEAE of decreased blood fibrinogen, which led to discontinuation from study; another participant from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC QW inhibitor dose cohort had Grade 3 treatment-related TEAEs of generalised pruritus and erythematous rash. The most commonly reported TEAEs, regardless of causality, were in the System Organ Classes (SOCs) of general disorders and administration site conditions (8 participants, 30.8%), infections and infestations (7 participants, 26.9%), and investigations (7 participants, 26.9%). All-causality TEAEs of injection site pain (3/26 participants, 11.5%), injection site swelling (3/26 participants, 11.5%), hypertension (3/26 participants, 11.5%), increased cardiac troponin I (3/26 participants, 11.5%), fatigue (2/26 participants, 7.7%), injection site bruising (2/26 participants, 7.7%), injection site induration (2/26 participants, 7.7%), influenza(2/26 participants, 7.7%), periodontitis (2/26 participants, 7.7%), contusion (2/26 participants, 7.7%), prolonged prothrombin time (2/26 participants, 7.7%), arthralgia (2/26 participants, 7.7%) and headache (2/26 participants, 7.7%) occurred in 2 or more participants in the study. The most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs were in the SOCs of general disorders and administration site conditions (7 participants, 26.9%), investigations (5 participants, 19.2%), and vascular disorders (2 participants, 7.7%). Treatment-related TEAEs of injection site pain (3/26 participants, 11.5%), injection site swelling (3/26 participants, 11.5%), injection site bruising (2/26 participants, 7.7%), injection site induration (2/26 participants, 7.7%) and hypertension (2/26 participants, 7.7%) occurred in 2 or more participants in the study. There were 2 (7.7%) participants who discontinued from study due to AEs, which were determined as treatment related by the investigator (see Subject Disposition and Demography section for details). There was 1 participant whose dose was reduced due to AEs, which were determined by the investigator as treatment related. Dose of 1 participant from the PF-06741086 450 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort was reduced in the consideration of previous multiple episodes of Grade 3 (severe) treatment-related injection site pain occurring in the participant. With the limited number of participants in each dose cohort, there was no apparent difference in the incidence of TEAEs across dose cohorts with the exception of injection site reactions. All injection site reaction related AEs were determined as treatment related by the investigator. The majority of injection site reactions were mild (Grade 1) in severity. There were no participants who met the Hy’s Law criteria. Two (2) participants (1 participant each from the PF-06741086 450 mg SC QW non-inhibitor and 300 mg SC QW inhibitor dose cohorts) had TEAEs of prolonged prothrombin time, one of which (the 300 mg SC QW inhibitor dose cohort) was determined to be treatment related by the investigator. One (1) participant from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC QW inhibitor dose cohort experienced a Grade 3 non-serious AE of decreased blood fibrinogen, which was determined as treatment related by the investigator. Across all dose cohorts, a reduction in fibrinogen was observed during the PF-06741086 treatment. The reduction did not appear to be dose dependent and was reversible upon completion of treatment. No reductions were determined to be clinically significant (ie, below the lower limit of normal [LLN] [150 mg/dL]). Three (3, 21.4%) participants from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC QW dose cohorts (2 inhibitor participants and 1 non-inhibitor participant) and 1 (16.7%) participant from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC loading + 150 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort had abnormal cardiac troponin I level (>1.0 × ULN) post baseline. Of these, 3 participants (1 participant each from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC QW non-inhibitor and inhibitor, and 300 mg SC loading + 150 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohorts) who had TEAEs of increased cardiac troponin I, two (1 participant each from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC QW inhibitor and 300 mg SC loading + 150 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohorts) were determined as treatment related by the investigator. None of the cardiac troponin I elevations had corresponding AEs or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating increased cardiovascular risk. Increase in systolic blood pressure 30 mm Hg for 1 participant from the PF-06741086 300 mg SC loading + 150 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort was associated with a Grade 2 AE of hypertension, which was determined to be treatment related and the participant discontinued due to this AE (pre-specified criteria for dose limiting toxicity). An increase in systolic blood pressure 30 mm Hg for 1 participant from the PF-06741086 450 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort was associated with an AE of back pain, which was due to a motor vehicle accident. Overall, for the respective dose cohorts, there was no apparent trend towards increased mean systolic or diastolic blood pressure. One (1) and the same participant from the PF-06741086 450 mg SC QW non-inhibitor dose cohort had abnormal QRS complex (140 msec) and QTcF values (450 msec and <480 msec) at baseline, Days 8, 15, 22 and 29. These abnormal QRS complex and QTcF values were not considered as clinically significant. Conclusions:  Multiple doses of PF-06741086 starting at 300 mg SC QW, with the lowest and highest weekly dose levels tested being 150 mg and 450 mg SC QW, respectively, were generally safe and well-tolerated in severe hemophilia A and B participants with or without inhibitors in this study.  The increased frequency and severity of injection site reactions at the 450 mg dose level was considered to be related to the increased injection volume of 1.5 mL, delivered 3 times per dose (whereas the other cohorts received PF-06741086 injection volumes 1 mL). These data indicate that the limits of tolerability were reached for some participants at this injection volume.  The incidental and transient elevations in cardiac troponin I were not associated with any AEs or ECG changes that would indicate increased cardiovascular risk, and thus were not deemed clinically significant.  Decreases in fibrinogen were observed across all dose levels. These changes are considered to be related to the mechanism of action of PF-06741086.  Prophylactic treatment with PF-06741086 was superior to On Demand treatment in a historical control group with respect to ABR reduction. The ABR reduction was statistically significant for the total of 24 participants across the PF-06741086 dose cohorts and remained significant in each respective PF-06741086 dose cohort.  There was a statistically significant reduction in ABR in the on-study treatment phase versus that reported for the pre-treatment (pre-study) phase in the total of 24 participants across the PF-06741086 dose cohorts. The observed reduction in ABR remained statistically significant in each PF-06741086 dose cohort.  Efficacy results based on the PPAS analysis and sensitivity analysis were comparable.  The ABRs were consistent between the hemophilia B participant and the hemophilia A participants in each respective cohort in the pre-treatment (pre-study) and on-study treatment phases, respectively.  In general, AUC and C increased in a dose-related manner over the 150 to tau max 450 mg weekly dose range following multiple-dose SC administration. PF-06741086 steady-state concentrations generally appeared to have been reached by Day 57.  No apparent difference in PK was observed between the hemophilia participants with and without inhibitors following 300 mg SC QW dosing.  Treatment-related changes were observed for all PD endpoints and generally the response was exposure-dependent in this study.  PD responses were mostly consistent between inhibitor and non-inhibitor participants and between hemophilia A and B participants.  A total of 4 positive results for treatment-induced ADA were observed in 3 participants, but no participant was tested positive for NAb. There was no impact to safety, PK, or PD observed in ADA positive participants.
