PROPRIETARY DRUG NAME®/GENERIC DRUG NAME: Enbrel®/Etanercept PROTOCOL NO.: B1801359 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Single-Arm, Open-Label Study to Assess the Immunogenicity, Safety, and Efficacy of Etanercept Manufactured Using the High Capacity Process Administered to Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis Study Centers: Subjects were enrolled from 9 countries in 29 centers (in parenthesis): Slovakia (6), Germany (5), Bulgaria (3), Hungary (3), Poland (3), South Africa (3), Croatia (2), Greece (2), and Serbia (2). Study Initiation Date and Final Completion Date: 02 April 2015 to 18 June 2016 Phase of Development: Phase 3b Study Objective(s): Primary Objective:  To assess the immunogenicity of etanercept (ETN) manufactured using the high capacity process administered weekly in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over 24 weeks. Secondary Objective:  To evaluate the overall safety and efficacy of ETN manufactured using the high capacity process administered weekly for 24 weeks. METHODS Study Design: This was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study designed to assess the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of ETN manufactured using the high capacity process, 50 mg once a week administered to subjects with moderate to severe RA who had not been treated previously with ETN. study was to assess the rate of ETN antidrug antibodies (ADAs) in RA subjects receiving ETN manufactured using the high capacity process weekly for 24 weeks. Subjects were screened within 4 weeks prior to administration of study drug to confirm that they met the entrance criteria for the study. The Screening period was intended for the washout of prohibited medications and tuberculosis (TB) testing/prophylactic treatment as necessary per local standards. The Screening period was to be a minimum of 4 days but no more than 4 weeks, and was only to be extended to 6 weeks when TB prophylactic treatment was necessary. Subjects who met all the inclusion criteria and had no exclusion criteria present were to receive 50 mg ETN by subcutaneous (SC) injection, once a week for 24 weeks. Immunogenicity assessments were performed at Baseline (Day 1) and at the Week 12 and Week 24 visits. Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at Baseline (Day 1) and at the Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24 visits. A safety follow-up visit was performed via telephone contact 28 to 32 days after the Week 24 or Early Withdrawal visit (this follow-up visit could have been performed at the study site if required by local guidelines). The schedule of activities is presented in Table 1. Table 1 Schedule of Activities Screeninga 4b, c b, c ADA = antidrug antibody; AE = adverse event; CCP = cyclic citrullinated peptide; CRF = case report form; ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; ETN = etanercept; EC = ethics committee; HAQ-DI = Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index; hs-CRP = high sensitivity C-reactive protein; IRB = institutional review board; IRT = Interactive Response Technology; PPD = purified protein derivative; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; RF = rheumatoid factor; SAE = serious adverse event; TB = tuberculosis; TNF = tumor necrosis factor. a. Screening procedures preferably occurred on the same day. The Screening period was intended for the washout of prohibited medications and TB testing/prophylactic treatment as necessary per local standards. The Screening period was a minimum of 4 days but no more than 4 weeks and may only have been extended to 6 weeks when TB prophylactic treatment was necessary. Results of all Screening procedures must have been available at the Baseline visit to determine eligibility. b. It was intended that all procedures for a visit occurred on the same day. c. The Week 4 and Week 12 visits occurred within a window of ±4 days of the projected visit date based on the Baseline visit date. d. The Week 24 visit occurred within a window of ±7 days of the projected visit date based on the Baseline visit date. e. An Early Withdrawal visit was performed for all subjects who withdrew from investigational product prior to completing the Week 24 visit and who received at least 1 dose of the investigational product. The Early Withdrawal visit was completed as soon as possible after the last dose of investigational product. f. Subject was contacted for safety follow-up 28 to 32 days after the Week 24/Early Withdrawal visit. If required by local regulations, the follow-up visit may have been conducted at the study site. Subjects who completed the Early Withdrawal visit more than 28 days after the last dose of investigational product were not required to have a follow-up visit. g. The chest radiograph was to be performed at the Screening visit only and read locally by a qualified reader. The chest radiograph was not required if it was done within 12 weeks before the Screening visit and the report was available and included in the subject’s source documents. If required by local regulations, a chest x-ray taken within 6 months of the Screening visit may have been used as long as the report was available and included in the subject’s source documents. Local country guidelines were followed for appropriate TB screening and prophylaxis in the setting of anti-TNF therapy including a minimum of a chest radiograph and objective TB testing such as QuantiFERON® or PPD depending on what was available and acceptable per local guidelines. QuantiFERON® was used unless it was not available or not accepted per local guidelines. A PPD of >5 mm was considered positive for TB unless local guidelines for testing of immunocompromised subjects (eg, those with RA) was available and different. h. Record medications taken to treat any new or ongoing AEs/SAEs that occurred since the Week 24 or Early Withdrawal visit. i. The procedure did not need to be repeated at the Baseline visit if it was completed at the Screening visit ≤14 days before the Baseline visit. j. Urine pregnancy tests were performed for all female subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, were of childbearing potential; this included subjects who were menstruating at the time of the visit and/or who were not sexually active. The sensitivity of all pregnancy tests used in the study must have been at least 25 mIU/mL. Pregnancy tests were also performed whenever a menstrual cycle was missed during the active treatment period or when potential pregnancy was otherwise suspected. Pregnancy tests may also have been repeated as per request of IRB/ECs or if required by local regulations. k. All male and female subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, were biologically capable of having children, were sexually active, and were at risk for pregnancy, must have agreed to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly for the duration of the active treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of investigational product. l. SAEs were reported from the signing of the informed consent document to 28 days after last administration of investigational product. SAEs occurring to a subject after the active reporting period had ended were to be reported to the sponsor if the investigator became aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believed to have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug were to be reported to the sponsor. AEs were recorded on the CRF from the time the subject had taken 1 dose of investigational product through last subject visit. m. The first dose of investigational product was administered at the study site by study personnel after all Baseline evaluations were completed. Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): Approximately 180 subjects were planned to be enrolled in this study. A total of 188 subjects were randomized, of which 187 subjects were treated with study drug. One subject was withdrawn after screening and randomization but prior to receiving study drug due to personal reasons. Of the 187 subjects treated with study drug, 39 were in Slovakia, 32 in South Africa, 29 in Germany, 24 in Poland, 19 in Bulgaria, 19 in Croatia, 13 in Hungary, 8 in Serbia, and 4 in Greece. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Main Inclusion Criteria: Individuals aged ≥18 years of age with moderate to severe RA who met the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA and had active disease, as defined by a disease activity score based on a 28 joint count (DAS28) ≥3.2 and the presence of at least 4 tender joints and 4 swollen joints at the Screening and Baseline visits, were eligible for the study. The patient or a designee must have been capable of administering the SC injection of study drug. All women of childbearing potential required a negative pregnancy test at screening and at randomization. Sexually active men and women had to use a highly effective method of contraception during the study. Main Exclusion Criteria: Subjects with any previous treatment with ETN and subjects with the presence of active infection, active TB, or evidence of untreated latent or active TB, were excluded. Study Treatment: ETN (50 mg) was to be administered by SC injection using a pre-filled syringe, once a week, for a total of 24 weeks. At the Baseline visit, the first dose of ETN was administered in the office by study personnel while the subject/designee observed. Study personnel provided training to the subject/designee on how and when to administer ETN at home. Subjects were instructed to administer ETN on the same day of the week throughout the study. However, if unavoidable, ETN could have been administered ±3 days from the regularly scheduled day (ie, 4 to 10 days from the previous dose). The next dose was then to return to the normal schedule. If more than 10 days elapsed since the last dose, then the next dose was to be taken as soon as possible and the subsequent dose should not have been given sooner than 4 days later. Immunogenicity, Efficacy, and Outcomes Research Endpoints: Primary Endpoint:  The percentage of subjects developing ETN ADAs through Week 24. Testing for ETN ADAs was performed at Baseline (Day 1), Week 12, and Week 24 or Early Termination.  The percentage of subjects developing ETN neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Testing for ETN NAbs was performed at Baseline (Day 1), Week 12, and Week 24 or Early Termination.  The percentage of subjects achieving a 20% improvement (ACR20), 50% improvement (ACR50), and 70% improvement (ACR70) in tender and swollen joint counts and 20% improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR-core set measures at Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24.  The change from Baseline (Day 1) in DAS28 at Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24.  The change from Baseline (Day 1) in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24.  The number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).  The number of subjects with investigator-identified serious infections.  The number of subjects with injection site reactions.  The number of subjects with laboratory abnormalities. Safety Evaluations: Safety was assessed in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of ETN. Safety assessments included the incidence of adverse events (AEs), investigator-identified infections, injection site reactions, serious infections, opportunistic infections, malignancy, SAEs, and AEs causing withdrawal of study drug, as well as changes in laboratory and vital sign measurements and the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 clinical laboratory abnormalities at all visits. Statistical Methods: Analysis Populations: The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population included all subjects who had taken at least 1 dose of ETN. The mITT was used for the efficacy analyses. Evaluations dated more than 15 days after the last dose of study drug were excluded from the efficacy analyses. The safety population included all subjects who had taken at least 1 dose of ETN. Analysis of Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint for this study was the percentage of subjects developing ETN ADAs through Week 24. The analysis of ETN ADA formation included all subjects who had taken at least 1 dose of investigational product and had at least 1 ETN ADA evaluation. In addition to the assessment of ETN ADAs at any time point, summaries of ETN ADA formation at Weeks 12 and 24 were provided. Summary statistics included the number of subjects with ETN ADA formation were also provided for subjects with and without concomitant methotrexate (MTX) use. As a secondary endpoint, the percentage of subjects developing NAbs at each scheduled evaluation, Week 12, and Week 24, was also evaluated in the same manner as the primary endpoint. Analysis of Efficacy and Outcomes Research Parameters: Efficacy endpoints were secondary in this study. The following efficacy endpoints were analyzed:  ACR Assessment: ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 were evaluated.  DAS28: Both DAS28 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and DAS28 C-reactive protein (CRP) versions were evaluated.  HAQ-DI: The HAQ-DI was summarized at all time points collected; individual domains were not summarized. Analysis of Safety Parameters: The safety of ETN was evaluated throughout the study and included the following:  Incidence of AEs, which included but were not limited to the following:  Investigator-identified infections;  Injection site reactions;  Serious infections;  Opportunistic infections;  Malignancy;  Demyelination disorders;  Autoimmune disorders.  Incidence of SAEs and serious infections.  Incidence of AEs causing withdrawal of ETN.  Mean change from Baseline in laboratory and vital sign measurements.  Incidence of Grade 3 and 4 clinical laboratory abnormalities (per National Cancer Institute [NCI] toxicity criteria version 4.0). Treatment-emergent status was assigned to all AEs and infections that had a start date on or after the date of the first dose of ETN through 30 days after the last dose of ETN. Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition is summarized in Table 2. A total of 188 subjects were randomized, of which 187 subjects were treated with study drug. One subject was withdrawn from the study after screening and randomization but prior to receiving study drug due to personal reasons. Of the 187 subjects treated with study drug, 8 subjects were ETN ADA positive (+) and 168 subjects were ETN ADA negative (-). Eleven subjects did not have an ETN ADA assessment. A total of 163 subjects (86.7%) completed the study and 25 subjects (13.3%) discontinued the study. The most common reason for withdrawal was due to an AE (14 subjects overall, 7.4%). One subject withdrew from the study early (Day 85) due to moving to another country and the reason for withdrawal was categorized as “Other”.

A summary of the number of subjects who were discontinued from the study is presented in Table 12. A total of 25 subjects (13.3%) discontinued the study. Ten subjects (5.3%) discontinued the study due to an AE that the investigator considered as possibly related to the study drug.

Deaths: One death occurred during the study in a 78-year-old male subject who experienced an SAE of acute heart failure (MedDRA preferred term: cardiac failure acute), which was considered by the investigator to be not related to study drug (Table 13). The subject had an ongoing relevant medical history of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and ischemic cardiac diseases.

Three subjects (1.6%) experienced a treatment-emergent serious infection during the study, which included moderate diverticulitis (assessed as possibly related to study drug), moderate pneumonia (assessed as not related to study drug), and moderate wound infection (assessed as not related to study drug). Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities: The incidence of laboratory tests of NCI Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicity is presented in Table 14. Overall, 5 subjects (2.7%) had a laboratory test of NCI Grade 3 toxicity during the study, out of which the laboratory test resolved in 2 subjects and was ongoing in 3 subjects at the time of study completion or early termination. No subjects met Hy’s law criteria.

Other Safety Related Observations: Three subjects (1.6%) reported treatment-emergent non-serious AEs of increased liver function enzymes during the study; all 3 subjects were taking concomitant MTX at the time of the event. One subject (0.5%) experienced a treatment-emergent non-serious AE of an autoimmune disorder (psoriasis) during the study, which was considered possibly related to study drug. A total of 24 subjects (12.8%) had a potentially clinically important vital sign result during the study. No treatment-emergent AEs of opportunistic infections, malignancies, demyelinating disorders, or pre-specified events of clinical importance were reported during the study. The immunogenicity of ETN manufactured using the high capacity process in this study was found to be consistent with prior study ADA outcomes. Improvement in clinical, functional, and health outcome measures was observed over time. A total of 9 subjects (4.8%) experienced a treatment-emergent SAE during the study and 1 death occurred during the study. The safety results in this study appear in line with the historical safety data that were collected in the clinical program with the currently approved ETN formulation.
