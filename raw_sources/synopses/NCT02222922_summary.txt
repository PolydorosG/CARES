Study Initiation Date: 17 October 2014 Study Completion Date: 05 November 2019 Report Date: 03 April 2021 Previous Report Date(s): 07 May 2020 Phase of Development: Phase 1 Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: The primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are presented in Table S1 (once every 3 weeks [Q3W] regimen) and Table S2 (once every 2 weeks [Q2W] regimen). CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1, open label, multi-center, non-randomized, multiple dose, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study, initially designed to evaluate single agent PF-06647020 (Q3W) in sequential cohorts of adult participants with advanced solid tumors for whom no standard therapy was available. The study was later expanded to evaluate safety, PK, and efficacy on a Q2W regimen as a single agent treatment of PF-06647020 in participants with ovarian cancer (OVCA) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as combination treatment of PF-06647020 with avelumab in participants with OVCA. After completion of both Q3W and Q2W regimens, a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was reached and the study was transitioned to an external partner (Abbvie Inc.) for co-development. The combination treatment of PF-06647020 with avelumab was not implemented for this report. The Q3W regimen included 2 parts. Part 1 estimated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/RP2D in dose escalation cohorts in participants with advanced solid tumors unresponsive to currently available therapies or for whom no standard therapy was available. Successive cohorts of participants received doses of PF-06647020 intravenously Q3W starting at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Part 2 was intended to enroll approximately 87 participants at a RP2D selected by the sponsor and investigators from Part 1, to explore benefit from treatment and to better define the safety profile, as well as the RP2D. This expansion cohort was expected to include approximately 22 participants with metastatic or recurrent triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), 45 participants with OVCA and 20 participants with advanced NSCLC. The drug-drug interaction (DDI) sub-study was an open-label, 2-period, fixed sequence design in up to 10 participants to determine the effect of multiple-dose fluconazole, a model moderate cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 inhibitor, on the PK of PF-06380101 (payload), when fluconazole was co-administered with PF-06647020. This sub-study was set up as a separate cohort from above mentioned studies in participants with TNBC, NSCLC and OVCA. The Q2W regimen contained a dose escalation scheme to estimate the MTD/RP2D of PF-06647020 as single agent treatment in participants with platinum-refractory or resistant OVCA and participants with recurrent NSCLC (in approximately 20 participants) using modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Q3W Regimen Participants (18 years) with solid tumor that was advanced/metastatic and resistant to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy was available were eligible for Part 1. Part 2 included participants with OVCA, TNBC and NSCLC. Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function. Q2W Regimen Participants (18 years) with platinum resistant or refractory OVCA having received 2 or fewer prior lines of systemic anticancer therapy, or recurrent advanced NSCLC having received 3 or fewer prior lines of systemic anticancer therapy were enrolled. status of 0-2, adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function. Study Treatment: Investigational product information is provided in Table S3. For Q3W regimen, PF-06647020 was administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle as an intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 60 minutes on an outpatient basis. A cycle was defined as the time from Day 1 dose to the next Day 1 dose. Each participant received PF-06647020 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination. For Q2W regimen, PF-06647020 was administered on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle as an IV infusion over approximately 60 minutes on an outpatient basis. A cycle was defined as the time from Day 1 dose to the next Day 1 dose. All participants were weighed within 72 hours prior to dosing for every cycle to ensure they did not experience either a weight loss or gain >10% from the prior weight used to calculate the amount of PF-06647020 required for dose preparation.

Assessment of response were made using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Changes in tumor size were categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease, or progressive disease, the latter incorporating the appearance of new lesions. For participants in Part 2 of the Q3W regimen, responses of CR or PR were confirmed by repeat assessment no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. OVCA participants had serum samples collected for cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) at pre-treatment, each tumor assessment (every 6 weeks), and end of treatment. Additional serum samples could be collected for assessment of CA-125 as per Investigator discretion. Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Evaluations: Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Blood samples (4 mL whole blood) to provide approximately 2 mL of serum for measurement of serum PF-06380101 concentrations and blood samples (6 mL whole blood) to provide approximately 3 mL of serum for determination of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) (PF-06647020) and total antibody (hu6M024 monoclonal antibody [mAb]) concentrations were collected from participants in dose escalation and randomized Arms A and C, in appropriately labeled tubes at pre-specified times. Human serum samples were analyzed for determination of ADC PF-06647020 using a validated, sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures (SOPs). Human serum samples were analyzed for determination of total antibody (hu6M024 mAb) using a validated, sensitive and specific ELISA method in compliance with Pfizer SOPs. Human serum samples were analyzed for determination of PF-06380101 using a validated, sensitive and specific ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method in compliance with Pfizer SOPs. Human plasma samples were analyzed for fluconazole concentrations using a validated, sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method in compliance with Pfizer SOPs The following PK parameters for PF-06647020 (ADC, conjugated antibody), PF-06380101 (unconjugated payload), and hu6M024 mAb (total antibody) were calculated for each participant and each treatment, as applicable, using noncompartmental analysis of concentration-time data. Parameters calculated in the study are described in Table S5. Samples below the lower limit of quantification were set to 0 µg/mL or 0 ng/mL for analysis. Actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis. Nominal time was used for PK parameter calculations if the actual time was missing. Table S4.

If data permitted. Immunogenicity Evaluation Blood samples (6 mL) to provide approximately 3 mL of serum to detect anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) against PF-06647020 were collected from all participants, into appropriately labeled tubes at pre-specified time. Samples were analyzed using validated analytical methods in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures. The ADA sample analysis followed a tiered approach of screening, confirmation, and titer determination. Human serum samples were analyzed for the detection of ADA to PF-06647020, using a validated electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay in compliance with Pfizer method SOPs. Human serum samples were analyzed for the detection of NAb to PF-06647020, using a validated CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Luminescent Cell Viability assay in compliance with Pfizer method SOPs. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included collection of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), vital signs and physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory assessments, as well as pregnancy tests and verification of concomitant treatments. Statistical Methods: Tumor response was presented in the form of participant data listings that included, but were not limited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor measurements, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. Objective tumor response, as assessed using the RECIST version 1.1 by calculating the objective response (OR), overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), time to progression (TTP), as determined by Investigator (as assessed by RECIST version 1.1), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and clinical benefit response rate were to be summarized and presented if data permitted. Analysis of Pharmacokinetics The PK parameter analysis population was defined as participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had sufficient information to estimate at least 1 of the PK parameters of interest. Drug concentrations of ADC (PF-06647020), total antibody (hu6M024 mAb), unconjugated payload (PF-06380101) were summarized graphically and with descriptive statistics by dose/regimen/treatment, cycle, and the nominal PK sampling time. Noncompartmental PK parameters were summarized descriptively by dose/regimen/treatment and cycle. Analysis of Immunogenicity The immunogenicity analysis set was defined as participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 ADA sample collected. The percentage of participants with positive ADA and NAb each was summarized by dose level (Part 1) or by treatment arms (Part 2). For participants with positive ADA or NAb, the magnitude (titer), time of onset, and duration of ADA or NAb response were also described, if data permitted. Analysis of Safety The safety analysis set included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. AEs were presented with and without regard to causality based on the investigator’s judgment. The frequency of overall toxicity, categorized by toxicity Grades 1 through 5, was described. AEs, ECGs, blood pressure, pulse rate, and safety laboratory data were reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study to evaluate the safety of participants. Any clinical laboratory, ECG, blood pressure and pulse rate abnormalities of potential clinical concern were described. Safety data were presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: Q3W Regimen A total of 113 participants were randomized and assigned to study treatments and 112 were treated with study drug (Table S5). One participant randomized to the PF-06647020 2.1 mg/kg treatment group had a declining ECOG PS (0 to 3) at baseline, therefore was never treated with study drug. A total of 67 (59.29%) participants completed the study and 46 (40.71%) discontinued from study. All 113 participants were discontinued from the study treatment. The main reason for discontinuation from the study treatment was objective progression or relapse (79 [69.9%] participants). The main reason for discontinuation from the study was Other (14 [12.4%] participants) (Table S5). CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Table S5.

Conclusions: Q3W Regimen (Dose Escalation, Dose Expansion and DDI) Dose Escalation  Two participants in the PF-06647020 3.7 mg/kg treatment group experienced a DLT (1 with Grade 3 fatigue and the other with Grade 3 headache). The MTD and RP2D of PF-06647020 were identified as 2.8 mg/kg Q3W based on the observed tolerability profile and was used in the dose expansion cohort.  When administered Q3W, PF-06647020 had a safety profile that was generally tolerable and manageable by dosing interruption, dose reduction, and/or standard medical therapy at increasing dose levels to participants with advanced solid tumors unresponsive to currently available therapies, or for whom no standard therapy was available. Dose Expansion  Consistent with the results in dose escalation, PF-06647020 at RP2D of 2.8 mg/kg Q3W demonstrated a generally well acceptable safety profile in participants with NSCLC, TNBC and OVCA. Dose Escalation and Expansion  PF-06647020 PK properties were investigated by analyzing 3 analytes including PF-06647020 (ADC, measured as conjugated payload), PF-06380101 (unconjugated payload), and hu6M024 mAb (total antibody) following Q3W IV infusion regimen.  PF-06647020 (ADC) exposure increased in a dose related manner following single and multiple Q3W dosing. Individual t values ranged between 0.697 to ½ 7.53 days for the Q3W doses with mean arithmetic t values ranging between ½ 3.107 days to 4.013 days for Q3W regimens where sufficient participants contributed to means. Mean CL values ranged from 0.03121 L/hr to 0.03956 L/hr for the Q3W following single and multiple dosing, and mean V values ranged ss from 2.808 L to 3.947 L, indicating that the drug is localized to the vascular compartment. Drug accumulation was minimal following repeated Q3W dosing.  PF-06380101 (unconjugated payload) exposure increased in a dose related manner following single and multiple Q3W dosing. Individual C values for max the Q3W doses ranged between 1.24 ng/mL to 24.5 ng/mL (geometric mean values of 3.379 ng/mL to 7.660 ng/mL at doses where means could be reported) following single and multiple dosing. Individual t values for the single and ½ multiple Q3W dosing ranged between 0.652 days to 5.25 days (arithmetic mean values ranged between 2.781 days to 3.210 days at doses where sufficient participants contributed to means). Drug accumulation was not observed following repeated Q3W dosing.  hu6M024 mAb (total antibody) exposure increased in a dose related manner following single and multiple Q3W dosing. Individual t values ranged between ½ 0.267 to 9.46 days for the Q3W doses following single and multiple doses with t½ arithmetic mean values ranging between 3.674 days to 5.232 days for Q3W and regimen. Drug accumulation was minimal following repeated Q3W dosing.  Eleven (10.2%) participants developed ADA positive response after receiving PF-06647020, 10 (9.3%) of which were tested NAb positive; all the 11 (10.2%) participants had positive ADA response against antibody domain. No hypersensitivity or infusion reaction were observed among these participants.  When administered Q3W, PF-06647020 demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity with an ORR of 16% in participants with NSCLC, 27% in participants with OVCA and 21% in participants with TNBC, and with a CR in 3 (6.8%) participants with OVCA. DDI  The effects of multiple doses of fluconazole, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the PK of PF-06380101 (unconjugated payload) following single-dose co-administration of PF-06647020 (ADC) was investigated. Co-administration of PF-06647020 with fluconazole did not have a notable impact on the overall exposure of PF-06380101. Ratios of the adjusted geometric means and (90% CI) for PF-06380101 exposure based on AUC (dn), AUC (dn) and C (dn) were 91.15% (44.79%, 185.50%), inf tau max 91.17% (44.87%, 185.25%), and 102.31% (51.08%, 204.90%), respectively, when PF-06647020 (ADC) was co-administered with fluconazole in Cycle 2 (Test) compared to administration alone in Cycle 1 (Reference). In addition, co-administration of PF-06647020 with fluconazole also did not have a notable impact on the overall exposure of PF-06647020 (ADC) and hu6M024 mAb (total antibody). Q2W Regimen (Dose Escalation)  Three participants experienced a DLT: 1 participant in the PF-06647020 2.8 mg/kg PF-06647020 3.2 mg/kg treatment group both had a DLT of Grade 3 abdominal pain. The RP2D of PF-06647020 was identified as 2.8 mg/kg Q2W based on the observed tolerability profile.  When administered Q2W, PF-06647020 had a safety profile that was generally tolerable and manageable by dosing interruption, dose reduction, and/or standard medical therapy at increasing dose levels to participants with advanced solid tumors unresponsive to currently available therapies, or for whom no standard therapy was available.  PF-06647020 PK properties were investigated by analyzing 3 analytes including PF-06647020 (ADC, measured as conjugated payload), PF-06380101 (unconjugated payload), and hu6M024 mAb (total antibody) following Q2W IV infusion regimen.  PF-06647020 (ADC) exposure increased in a dose related manner following single and multiple Q2W dosing. Individual t values ranged between 1.48 to ½ 4.24 days for the Q2W doses with mean arithmetic t values ranging between ½ 2.700 days to 3.633 days for Q2W regimens where sufficient participants contributed to means. Mean CL values ranged from 0.02044 L/hr to 0.03238 L/hr for the Q2W regimens following single and multiple dosing, and mean V values ss ranged from 2.349 L to 3.106 L, indicating that the drug is localized to the vascular compartment. Drug accumulation was minimal following repeated Q2W dosing.  PF-06380101 (unconjugated payload) exposure increased in a dose related manner following single and multiple Q2W dosing. Mean C values for the max Q2W doses ranged between 4.248 and 6.665 ng/mL following single and multiple dosing. Arithmetic mean t values for the Q2W doses ranged between 2.507 days ½ to 3.007 days. Drug accumulation was not observed following repeated Q2W dosing.  hu6M024 mAb (total antibody) exposure increased in a dose related manner following single and multiple Q2W dosing. Individual t values ranged between ½ 1.26 to 5.89 days for the Q2W doses following single and multiple doses with t½ arithmetic mean values ranging between 3.436 days to 4.734 days for Q2W regimens. Drug accumulation was minimal following repeated Q2W dosing.  One participant (4.0%) developed ADA positive response after receiving PF-06647020, who was tested NAb positive and positive for ADA against antibody domain. No severe hypersensitivity or infusion reaction occurred on this participant.  When administered Q2W, PF-06647020 demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity with an ORR of 33% in participants with NSCLC and 26% in participants with OVCA, including a CR in 2 (10.5%) participants with OVCA.
