Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 5-arm (placebo, plus 4 active doses of PF-05221304), parallel-group study. The overall study design is summarized in Figure S1. Figure S1. Study Design Approximately 360 participants (72 per arm) were planned to be randomized at approximately 120 sites to ensure a minimum of 300 participants (60 per arm) completed the study. The entire study population had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (liver fat 8% by Magnetic Resonance Imaging - Proton Density Fat Fraction [MRI-PDFF] as part of screening assessment) and features of metabolic syndrome. In each arm, ≥50% of participants randomized were deemed to be eligible for 1st tier stratification of diagnosed/presumed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); with the remaining participants per arm eligible for the 1st tier stratification of NAFLD with likely minimal inflammation and fibrosis – refer to Figure S2. Figure S2. Overview of C1171002 Study Population Adult (≥18 and ≤ 70 yrs) patients with NAFLD defined as liver fat of ≥ 8% Based on MRI-PDFF at Visit 2 / Screen 2 with No Additional Criteria at Randomization Diagnosed or Presumed NASH • Features of Metabolic Syndrome* plus Biopsy-proven • ALT > ULN & ≤ 5x ULN NASH in previous and ≤ 24-months • Liver stiffness on FibroScan® ≥ 7.0 kPa^ NAFLD with likely minimal inflammation & fibrosis • Features of Metabolic Syndrome* plus • ALT ≤ 1.25x ULN *Defined by meeting ≥ 2 of 5 criteria related to fasting plasma and glucose, fasting high-density cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, • Liver stiffness on FibroScan® < 7.0 kPa^ waist circumference, and blood pressure Plus, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (Western) or 22.5 kg/m2 (Asian) ^Identification of liver stiffness thresholds based on unpublished (as of issuance of this protocol) individual subject-level data co-owned by EchoSens, manufacturer of FibroScan, and shared with Sponsor for purposes of designing this protocol Beyond the categorization of the enrolled population into diagnosed/presumed NASH versus NAFLD with likely minimal inflammation and fibrosis, this study applied a 2nd tier stratification to identify the population with and without a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) result >6.5% and/or current use of agents for glycemic control. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Male or female participants between the ages of 18 (or the minimum country-specific age of consent if >18) and 70 years, inclusive at Visit 1 (Screen 1), with total body weight of >50 kg (110 lbs) and body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m2 (for sites in Africa, Europe, North America) or BMI 22.5 kg/m2 (for sites in Asia), Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) 280 dB/m, International Normalized Ratio (INR) 1.3, albumin  lower limit of normal (LLN), platelet count  0.95 × LLN, fasting triglycerides 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L), HbA1c 9.5%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L), total bilirubin <1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and direct bilirubin  ULN at Pre-Qualification and Visit 1 (Screen 1); with liver fat of ≥8% at Visit 2. Participants with documented liver biopsy 24 months prior to Visit 1 (Screen 1) with histological evidence of NASH were classified in the sub-population of (presumed) NASH along with those with liver stiffness measurement (LSM) 7.0 kPa, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > ULN and 5 × ULN. Alternatively, participants were classified as NAFLD with minimal inflammation/fibrosis based on LSM <7.0 kPa and ALT 1.25 × ULN. Other than participants with histological evidence of NASH, all participants were required to meet 2 of the following 5 criteria for metabolic syndrome at Pre-Qualification and Visit 1 (Screen 1):  FPG 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), or on permitted pharmacological agents with explicit purpose of improving glycemic control;  Fasting serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <40 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) for males and <50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) for females, or on permitted pharmacological agents with explicit purpose to increase HDL-C;  Fasting serum triglycerides 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), or on permitted pharmacological agents with explicit purpose to decrease triglycerides;  Seated blood pressure (BP) 130 / 85 mm Hg, or on permitted pharmacological agents with explicit purpose for BP control;  Waist circumference 40 inches (102 cm) for males and 35 inches (89 cm) for females. Study Treatment: Blinded investigational products (PF-05221304 and its matched placebo) were provided as tablets for oral administration. Participants were instructed to take the blinded investigational products once daily (QD) at the same time of day with the morning meal each day for 16 weeks.

Secondary endpoint: percent change from baseline in ALT, at Week 16. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), safety laboratory tests, vital signs (BP and pulse rate), and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). Statistical Methods: For the primary and secondary endpoints of placebo-adjusted, percent change from baseline in liver fat via MRI-PDFF (in entire study population) and ALT (in the sub-population of diagnosed/presumed NASH) at Week 16, a mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) analysis was performed with treatment, time and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, and participant as a random effect. Reporting results:  Raw data and percent changes from baseline: Randomized participant, number of minimum, maximum, Q1 and Q3 at baseline and post-baseline visits were presented for each randomized arm.  MMRM Outputs:  Adjusted geometric least squares (LS) mean estimates with 80% confidence interval (CI) for each randomized arm along with the translation in percent change over time,  Ratio of adjusted geometric LS mean estimates for each active randomized arm against placebo and the corresponding 80% CI along with the translation in percent difference over time. For the primary endpoint (effect on liver fat [assessed via MRI-PDFF] at Week 16), clear separation from placebo was defined as 2-sided p <0.05. For all other statistical analyses mentioned in this section, statistical significance was defined when the 80% CI did not include 0 (eg, 2-sided p <0.2). Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), as well as serious adverse events (SAEs)/deaths, clinical safety-related laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG data, as well as vital signs (including BP and pulse rate) were presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively by randomized dose group in accordance with sponsor reporting standards. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 1705 participants entered pre-qualification; of these, 643 (37.7%) participants entered the main study (ie, Screen 1). In total, 305 participants were randomized - reflecting 17.9% of participants who entered pre-qualification and 47.4% of participants who entered Screen 1. Of the 305 participants randomized, 208 (68.2%) met the criteria for 1st tier stratification of (presumed) NASH while 124 (40.7%) were confirmed to be participants with T2DM. A total of 263 (86.2%) randomized participants completed the study and 42 (13.8%) participants were discontinued prior to completion of the study-prescribed 2nd follow-up visit. Disposition of the randomized population is summarized in Table S3. Across the treatment groups, the population was similar for gender, age, race, BMI, and baseline liver fat, HbA1c, platelets, liver function tests (LFTs), lipids and apolipoproteins, as well as metabolic syndromes and T2DM. The age of the population randomized ranged from 19 to 70 years with a mean age of 53.4 years; with 171 (56.1%) of the participants being female. Table S3.

Safety Results: A total of 16 participants experienced 22 SAEs during the study. Of these, 13 SAEs including 1 fatal event in 10 participants occurred prior to randomization and 9 SAEs in 6 participants occurred during post randomization. None of the SAEs reported post randomization was considered treatment-related by the investigator and none resulted in permanent discontinuation from the study. Approximately two-thirds of the 305 participants reporting TEAEs of “severe” intensity. A total of 23 (7.5%) of the 305 randomized participants were permanently discontinued due to AEs while 13 (4.3%) participants had a temporary discontinuation of study drug due to AEs. Table S6 summarizes the all-causality and treatment-related TEAEs reported in this study, but limited to TEAEs reported in ≥5 participants across the randomized treatment regimens studied. Table S6.

Total reflects participants who were randomized and had received at least 1 dose of double-blinded treatment.MedDRA version 22.0 coding dictionary applied. Other than 13 participants (12 randomized to 1 of the PF-05221304 doses) discontinued from study for meeting a priori identified, protocol-defined threshold for hypertriglyceridemia (ie, repeated fasting serum triglyceride ≥800 mg/dL), and 2 participants discontinued from study (1 post Week 2 and 1 post Week 4) due to elevation in LFTs (which did not meet protocol-defined criteria for Hy’s Law), no other laboratory abnormality of special interest necessitated premature discontinuation of participants. At Week 16, significant, dose-responsive reductions in HDL-C, apolipoprotein A1, and low non-HDL, apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, apolipoprotein C3, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and apolipoprotein E were observed with the top 3 doses of PF-05221304 (10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg) relative to placebo. The increases in fasting serum triglycerides, non- HDL along with decreases in HDL-C and direct LDL-C were evident as early as Week 2 and appeared to plateau at the latest by Week 8, with a return to baseline observed once study drug was stopped (ie, at follow-up visit). Across the fasted apolipoproteins assessed, increases in apolipoprotein B, C3, and E (along with reduction in apolipoprotein A1) were evident by Week 4 with no further change despite continued dosing until Week 16. Compared to placebo, PF-05221304 had no clinical meaningful effect on vital signs or cardiac conduction intervals as assessed by 12-lead ECGs. Conclusions:  Over the dosing duration of 16 weeks, PF-05221304 was found to decrease hepatic steatosis in a dose-dependent manner with effect clearly separating from placebo at the top 3 doses evaluated (10 mg to 50 mg) in this study in adults with NAFLD.  PF-05221304, in the sub-set of adults with ALT >ULN - ie, (presumed) NASH, decreased non-specific/non-selective markers of overall liver health (ALT), in a dose-dependent manner, with this effect clearly separating from placebo at the top 3 doses evaluated (10 mg to 50 mg), in this study.  The 25-fold dose range of PF-05221304 was found to be generally well tolerated in this study.  However, the observed changes in serum triglycerides and accompanying effect on other lipid parameters at the top 2 doses of PF-05221304 are undesirable due to their potential implications for long term cardiometabolic health.
