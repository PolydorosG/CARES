Publications: None Study Period: Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 02 November 2021 Study Completion Date (Last Participant Last Visit): 10 January 2022 This study was neither discontinued nor interrupted. Rationale: The purpose of the study was to estimate the inductive effect of multiple-dose ritlecitinib on single dose PK of tolbutamide. Objectives, Endpoints, and Statistical Methods: Study objectives and endpoints are listed in Table S1. Statistical methods are summarized Pharmacokinetics (PK): PK Concentration Set: All participants treated who took at least 1 concentration in at least 1 treatment period. PK Parameter Evaluable Set: All participants treated who had at least 1 of the PK parameters of primary interest in at least 1 treatment period. Safety: Safety Analysis Set: All participants assigned to study intervention and who took at least 1 dose of the study intervention. Participants were analyzed according to the product they actually received. Table S1.

Methodology: This was a Phase 1, 2-period, multiple-dose, open-label, single fixed-sequence study to estimate the effect of ritlecitinib on tolbutamide pharmacokinetics in healthy participants. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): A total of approximately 12 healthy male and/or female participants were planned to be enrolled in the study to obtain at least 10 evaluable participants who completed the study. A total of 12 participants were assigned to the study. All participants were treated in Period 1 (tolbutamide treatment alone) and 2 of them were discontinued due to adverse event (AE) and other reason. Ten participants were treated in Period 2 (multiple dose ritlecitinib plus single dose tolbutamide treatment) and completed the study. In Period 1, 12 participants were in the PK and safety analysis sets; in Period 2, 10 participants were in the PK and safety analysis sets. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Healthy adult participants were enrolled in this study. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): In Period 1, participants were dosed with a single administration of tolbutamide 500 mg tablet on Day 1. Tolbutamide PK was assessed for 36 hours following dosing. Period 1 was immediately followed by Period 2 with no washout. In Period 2, participants were dosed with oral 200 mg ritlecitinib QD for 10 days. On the morning of Day 10, a single dose of 500 mg tolbutamide oral tablet was administered within approximately 5 minutes after administration of a 200-mg dose of ritlecitinib. Tolbutamide PK in Period 2 again was assessed at pre-dose and over 36 hours after tolbutamide dosing. Study drug information is provided in Table S2. Table S2.

In Period 2, the planned duration of treatment was 10 days. Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: All of the participants were healthy adults between 18-64 years of age. Most participants were male (75%) and the majority of participants were White (58.3%). Exposure: In Period 1, the duration of treatment was 1 day. In Period 2, the duration of treatment was Safety Results: No participant had a serious adverse event (SAE), severe AE, or medication error due to a TEAE. One participant was discontinued from study due to TEAEs. All TEAEs were mild in severity. The TEAEs reported were Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection, pain, nail disorder, and hypoglycaemia. The only treatment-related TEAE was hypoglycaemia in Period 2 (with co-administration of ritlecitinib and tolbutamide) and was considered as related to tolbutamide. Apple juice 8 ounce (oz) and orange juice 12 oz were administered to treat the event. No action was taken for the participant and the dose of ritlecitinib 200 mg and tolbutamide 500 mg was not changed. The numbers of participants with laboratory abnormalities were generally similar across both periods. None of the laboratory abnormalities were considered clinically significant. No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs measurements, electrocardiogram (ECGs) or other observations related to safety were observed in this study. Pharmacokinetic Results: The median plasma concentrations and PK parameters AUC and C of tolbutamide inf max administered with and without ritlecitinib, were similar for both treatments. The median Tmax values were 4.53 hours and 5 hours when tolbutamide was administered with and without ritlecitinib, respectively. The t values of tolbutamide were similar when dosed with and ½ without ritlecitinib. The observed variability for AUC and C was low with geometric inf max coefficient of variation (CV%) of 20% and 15%, respectively, for tolbutamide alone and 30% and 17%, respectively, following co-administration with ritlecitinib. The ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% confidence interval [CI]) for AUC , inf AUC and C of tolbutamide following administration of tolbutamide with ritlecitinib last max relative to tolbutamide administered alone were 99.05% (92.01%, 106.62%), 98.26% (92.77%, 104.08%) and 103.01% (96.66%, 109.77%), respectively. Conclusions: PK:  The ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% CIs) for AUC , AUC and C inf last max of tolbutamide following administration of tolbutamide with ritlecitinib relative to tolbutamide administered alone were 99.05% (92.01%, 106.62%), 98.26% (92.77%, 104.08%) and 103.01% (96.66%, 109.77%), respectively.  The AUC , AUC and C values of tolbutamide were not affected by multiple inf last max doses of ritlecitinib as the 90% CIs for AUC , AUC and C were all contained inf last max within 80-125%. Safety:  Multiple-dose ritlecitinib was generally safe and well tolerated when co-administered with a single dose of tolbutamide.
