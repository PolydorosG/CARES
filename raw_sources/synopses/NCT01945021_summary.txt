PrimaryEfficacy To assess the Best overall response Reported in Clinical Study antitumor efficacy of as assessed by ORR Report (CSR) dated 06 June oral single-agent and evaluated by 2016 and CSR dated 26 crizotinib independent radiology January 2017. administered to East review (IRR). Asian patients with advanced ALK- negative NSCLC harboring a translocation or inversion event METHODS Study Design: This was an open-label, multi-national, multi-center, single-arm phase 2 study of oral crizotinib in East Asian patients with ALK-negative advanced NSCLC harboring a translocation or inversion event involving the ROS1 gene locus. A total of 100 response-evaluable patients with advanced ROS1 fusion-positive/ALK fusion-negative NSCLC were expected to be enrolled into this study from approximately 50 sites in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: East Asian patients with ALK-negative advanced NSCLC harboring a translocation or inversion event involving the ROS1 gene locus were included in this study. Study Treatment: Crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (BID) was to be administered orally at approximately the same time each day on a continuous daily dosing schedule. The investigational product information is provided in Table S2. Efficacy Evaluations: Disease assessments were to be performed as scheduled according to the calendar days regardless of treatment delays. On-study tumor assessments were to be performed every 8 weeks (with the exception of bone scans that were to be performed, if required, every 12 weeks) for the first 8 cycles, then every 12 weeks from the date of first dose of study medication until radiographic disease progression was documented by IRR or until the patient permanently discontinued crizotinib treatment, whichever occurred later. The date of first dose of study medication was to be used as the baseline when calculating when the next tumor assessment was due. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was to be performed whenever disease progression was suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration). The determination of anti-tumor efficacy was to be based on objective tumor assessments made according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 Other Evaluations: Molecular Profiling The primary assay for detecting ROS1 gene fusion events in tumor samples was an Amoy reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, which was designed to detect 14 of the commonly recognized ROS1 fusion proteins. Negative status for translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene were determined in patients with ROS1-positive tumors using validated tests. Patient-Reported Outcomes PROs for lung cancer/treatment-related symptoms, functioning and global QoL were assessed using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (EORTC) core quality of life The EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-LC13 were completed by patients prior to any testing, treatment or discussion with the physician or clinic personnel. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included AEs, laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), physical examination, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and ophthalmology examination. QTcF was the primary correction factor for ECG and QTcB was provided for completeness. Statistical Methods: The purpose of the present supplemental CSR was to update OS; OS being defined as the time, in months, from the date of the first dose of crizotinib to the date of death due to any cause. OS was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically. Median event times and 2-sided 95% CIs were provided. Analysis for EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 questionnaires were updated and a clinically meaningful change for the symptom and functional domains, and global QoL was defined as a 10-point or greater change in scores. All outputs for safety outcomes were based on the safety analysis population. Safety was to be assessed through summaries of the frequency and severity of AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 129 patients were enrolled, of whom 127 were allocated to treatment with crizotinib. All 127 patients permanently discontinued crizotinib, the most frequent reasons for permanently discontinuing treatment was disease progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria for 64 (50.4%) patients and AEs for 10 (7.9%) patients. Table S3 presents the summary of overall patient disposition. All patients were Asian, and most of the patients were 65 years of age. There were more female than male patients. Most patients did not have a history of smoking. All patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at study entry. Table S3.

DBL date: 01JUL2020 Patient-Reported Outcomes Results: Completion Rates The completion of at least 1 question from the EORTC QLQ-LC13 ranged from 97% to 100%, EORTC QLQ-C30 had 100% completion rates. Global Quality of Life An improvement from baseline was observed for global QoL as early as Cycle 2, with clinically meaningful improvement seen at Cycle 60. Most patients had either improved (24.6% to 50.0%) or stable (38.4% to 55.0%) scores in global QoL during treatment from Cycle 2 to Cycle 60. Functioning Domains EORTC QLQ-C30 Clinically meaningful improvement from baseline in emotional functioning was observed at Cycle 60. There was no clinically meaningful improvement (≥10-point change) noted for physical, role, cognitive or social functioning at any cycle. More than half of patients were noted to have improved (≥10-point increase from baseline) or stable scores in the functioning domains during treatment through Cycle 60. Symptoms EORTC QLQ-C30 Clinically meaningful improvement from baseline was noted for dyspnea at Cycles 7-10, Cycles 16-18, Cycles 22-24, and Cycle 40. For insomnia, clinically meaningful improvement was noted at Cycle 4, Cycle 10, Cycle 20, Cycle 40 and Cycle 60. Clinically meaningful improvement from baseline in appetite loss was noted observed from Cycle 54 through Cycle 60. For constipation, clinically meaningful worsening from baseline was noted at Cycle 2 to Cycle 4, Cycle 12, Cycle 16 to Cycle 18, Cycle 24 to Cycle 36, Cycle 44 to Cycle 46, Cycle 50 to Cycle 52, and Cycle 60. For diarrhea, clinically meaningful worsening from baseline was noted Cycle 2 to Cycle 10, and Cycle 16. The symptoms with the highest proportion of patients “worsening” from Cycle 2 to Cycle 60 were constipation (25.9% to 45.0%), diarrhea (13.8% to 43.4%), and nausea and vomiting (13.0% to 40.2%). EORTC QLQ-LC13 Clinically meaningful improvement in chest was noted from Cycle 16 to Cycle 28 and again at Cycle 34 to Cycle 42, and finally at Cycle 46 to Cycle 60. Clinically meaningful improvement of pain in arm or shoulder was seen from Cycle 54 to Cycle 60. Clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms of cough was seen as early as Cycle 2 and maintained through Cycle 60. Worsening from baseline was noted in the symptoms of sore mouth, dysphagia, and peripheral neuropathy, and none of the cycles showed clinically meaningful worsening. The symptoms with the highest proportion of patients “improved” from Cycle 2 to Cycle 60 (≥10-point decrease from baseline) were coughing (42.6% to 50.5%), pain in chest (25.9% to 35.3%), dyspnea (22.1% to 35.3%), and pain in arm or shoulder (24.3% to 35.3%). Safety Results: Extent of Exposure The median duration of crizotinib treatment was 101.70 weeks (range: 0.6 to 291.9 weeks), the median relative dose intensity was 100% (range: 47.2% to 100.0%). A total of 30 (23.6%) patients had at least 1 dose reduction. Adverse Events All patients had at least 1 all-causality AE during the study. Most patients (97.6%) had at (SAE), of which 11 were considered treatment-related. Grade 5 AEs were reported in 15 (11.8%) patients, and 1 of them was considered treatment-related. All-causality AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of crizotinib, dosing interruptions, or dose reductions were reported in 8.7%, 44.1%, and 18.9% of patients, respectively (Table S5). Table S5.

MedDRA Version 23.0 was used to code adverse events. One patient experienced an adverse event (Diarrhoea, relationship = Reasonable Possibility) which had been entered into the database in error as leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. The site was closed before a correction in the database could be applied. This adverse event has been included in the summary. DBL date: 01JUL2020. All-causality AEs experienced by ≥30% of patients were ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES, VISION DISORDER, Diarrhoea, Nausea, Vomiting, Constipation, NEUTROPENIA, OEDEMA, and UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION. Treatment-related AEs experienced by ≥30% of patients were ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES, VISION DISORDER, Diarrhoea, Nausea, NEUTROPENIA, Vomiting, and Constipation. The most frequently reported (≥3%) maximum Grade 3 all-causality AEs were NEUTROPENIA, ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES, ANEMIA, Pneumonia, Hyponatraemia, and LEUKOPENIA. The most frequently reported (≥3%) maximum Grade 3 treatment-related AEs were NEUTROPENIA and ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES. The most frequently reported (≥1%) maximum Grade 4 all-causality and treatment-related AEs were NEUTROPENIA and ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES. A total of 10 (7.9%) patients had AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of crizotinib, and a total of 2 patients had treatment-related AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of crizotinib, and the AEs were Chronic kidney disease and HEPATOTOXICITY (1 each). All-causality AEs associated with dose reductions were reported for 24 (18.9%) patients. The most frequently reported (≥2%) treatment-related AEs leading to dose reductions were the same as all-causality AEs, and the AEs were ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES, Decreased Appetite, Fatigue NEUTROPENIA, and RENAL CYST. Overall, 56 (44.1%) patients had a dosing interruption associated with all-causality AEs (included NEUTROPENIA, ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES, Pneumonia, LEUKOPENIA, ANEMIA, Vomiting, Nausea, OESOPHAGITIS, Pyrexia, ABDOMINAL PAIN, Decreased appetite, Deep vein thrombosis, Diarrhoea, Fatigue and LYMPHOPENIA). Treatment-related AEs associated with dosing interruptions were reported for 39 (30.7%) patients, including all 15 patients with NEUTROPENIA, 9 of the 10 patients with ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES and 2 of the 8 patients with pneumonia. Deaths Overall, 65 (51.2%) patients died during the study, and 1 death occurred within 30 days after the first dose. The most common cause of death was progression of disease (41.7%). There were in total 15 patients with Grade 5 AEs (Disease progression [n=7], Respiratory failure [n=4], Pneumonia [n=2], Lung neoplasm malignant [n=1] ,and Road traffic accident [n=1]), of which 1 (Respiratory failure) was considered treatment-related. Other Serious Adverse Events All-causality SAEs were reported in 46 (36.2%) patients. The most frequently reported (≥3% of patients) all-causality SAEs were Pneumonia, Disease progression, Respiratory failure and ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES. Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 11 (8.7%) patients. Treatment-related SAEs reported in more than 1 patient were ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES and RENAL CYST. Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Shifts in hematology parameters from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or Grade 4 postbaseline (≥2% of patients) were observed for neutrophil count decreased (11.9%), lymphocyte count decreased (7.2%), anemia (6.3%), and white blood cells decreased (3.1%). Shifts in blood chemistry parameters from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or Grade 4 postbaseline (≥2% of patients) were observed for hyperuricemia (26.2%), hypophosphatemia (11.1%), ALT increased (7.0%), hyponatremia (9.4%), hypokalemia (4.7%), AST increased (4.7%), and hypoalbuminemia (2.4%). Vital Signs Overall, 1 (0.8%) patient had a pulse rate 120 bpm and 7 (5.5%) patients had a pulse rate 50 bpm while on treatment. Increases of ≥20 mmHg in DBP from baseline were reported for 18 (14.2%) patients and increases of ≥40 mmHg in SBP from baseline were reported for 3 (2.4%) patients. Decreases of ≥40 mmHg in DBP from baseline were reported for 2 (1.6%) patients and decreases of ≥60 mmHg in SBP from baseline were reported for 2 (1.6%) patients. Electrocardiogram Most patients (90.3%) had a maximum QTcF of 450 msec during the study, a maximum QTcF ≥500 msec was reported for 3 (2.4%) patients, and QTcF ≥60 msec increase from baseline were reported for 7 (5.6%) patients. The 3 patients with QTcF ≥500 msec also had a QTcF ≥60 msec increase from baseline. Conclusion(s):  The updated OS analysis showed that in East Asian patients with ROS1-positive, ALK-negative advanced NSCLC, crizotinib provided meaningful clinical benefit, as evidenced by a median OS of 44.2 months (95% CI: 32.0, NR) and was independent of the number of prior metastatic treatments.  The safety results of this supplemental CSR were consistent with the final CSR and the first supplemental CSR. No new safety signals were identified.
