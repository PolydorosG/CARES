Sponsor: Pfizer, Inc. Investigational Product: Crisaborole/PF-06930164 Clinical Study Report Synopsis: Protocol C3291001 Protocol Title: A Phase 2a, Randomized, Double-Blind, Vehicle-Controlled Study, to Characterize the Mechanism of Action of Crisaborole Ointment 2%, by Evaluation of Efficacy and Changes in Skin Biomarkers, in Adult Subjects With Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis, With a 4 Week Open-Label Extension Investigator: Study Center: The study was conducted at a single center in Canada. Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation and Completion Dates: 31 July 2017 and 04 May 2018 Report Date: 04 January 2019 Previous Report Date(s): Not Applicable Phase of Development: Phase 2a Study Objectives: Primary Objectives  To evaluate the efficacy of crisaborole ointment 2% versus vehicle in subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD).  To evaluate change in key skin biomarkers of AD in target lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle. Secondary Objectives  To evaluate change in other skin biomarkers of AD in target lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle.  To evaluate normalization of biomarker and gene expression levels in lesional skin treated with crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle.  To evaluate changes in AD clinical sign and symptom severity in target lesions treated with crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle.  To assess the safety and local tolerability of crisaborole ointment 2% in subjects with mild to moderate AD. METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 2a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, intra-subject study to characterize the mechanism of action, by evaluation of efficacy and changes in key skin biomarkers, of crisaborole ointment 2% in adult subjects with mild to moderate AD. After completing screening activities, including meeting eligibility criteria, 40 subjects were to be treated. In the double-blind treatment period, each subject was randomly assigned and treated with crisaborole ointment 2% for 1 target lesion. The other target lesion in the same subject received vehicle. The double-blind treatment period lasted from baseline/Day 1 to Day 15 skin biopsy collection and included twice-a-day (BID) visits to the site for investigational product application and study assessments, where applicable. The open-label treatment period started from the Day 15 skin biopsy collection and lasted until Day 43 (end of treatment/early termination); during this time, subjects were able to treat all AD skin areas (except scalp), at home, with crisaborole ointment 2%. Scheduled (outpatient) study visits for all subjects occurred at screening (up to 30 days prior to Day 1/baseline), Days 1 to 14 (BID), Day 15, and Day 43 (end of treatment/early termination). On Day 71 (end of study), a follow-up telephone call was made by site staff to assess for adverse events (AEs) that could have occurred since the last visit and to confirm appropriate contraceptive usage. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Eligible adult subjects were expected to have confirmed clinical diagnosis of active AD according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria with at least 6 month history prior to screening visit and that had been clinically stable for 1 month. At baseline/Day 1 visit, subjects should have had a global Investigator’s Static Global Assessment (ISGA) of 2 or 3, a body surface area (BSA) covered with AD of at least 0.5% and no more than 10% (excluding face, scalp, axilla, genitals, groin area, palms, back of the hands, and soles), 2 lesions of AD at least 3 cm × 3 cm with identical lesion ISGA of 3. Subject were ineligible if they had clinically infected AD or subjects requiring high-potency topical corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids to manage AD; or if they had history of angioedema or anaphylaxis to topical products or known sensitivity to any of the components of crisaborole ointment 2%. Study Treatment: Crisaborole ointment 2% and vehicle were provided in 60 g tubes (Table S1) by the sponsor. The tubes were provided in cartons labeled in an open-label fashion according to local regulatory requirements. In all other respects (color, texture and odor), the vehicle appeared the same as crisaborole ointment 2%. The subject received both products concurrently to ensure blinding. The investigational products were for external use on the skin only. Crisaborole ointment 2% or vehicle was applied BID from Day 1 to Day 42. Table S1. Investigational Product Description Investigational Product Vendor Lot Pfizer Lot Strength/ Dosage Form Description Number Number Potency Crisaborole topical ointment, 2% Ointment 2% 60 g tube (clinical image) Crisaborole ointment, vehicle, 0% Ointment 60 g tube Efficacy Evaluations: Primary Efficacy: Change from baseline in Total Sign Score (TSS) in target lesions at Day 15 was the primary efficacy endpoint. The lesion TSS is an assessment of the severity of each of the following: erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification. Each of these were rated using the 4-point severity scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Secondary Efficacy: Change from baseline in TSS in target lesions at Day 8 was 1 of the secondary efficacy endpoints. Other secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline in lesion severity as measured by ISGA at Day 8 and Day 15, and pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at each visit up to Day 15. The overall severity of AD and each target lesion severity of AD were assessed by ISGA scores and categories (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe). The intensity of pruritus was assessed by an NRS, an 11-point numeric rating scale from 0 to 10, to be completed for each target lesion and globally. Biomarkers Evaluations: Primary Biomarker: Change from baseline in key skin biomarkers of AD at Day 15 was the primary biomarker endpoint. The key skin biomarkers included S100A12, CCL17, CCL18, CCL22, Keratin 16, elafin/PI3 and Interleukin (IL)-13. Secondary Biomarker: Change from baseline in key skin biomarkers of AD at Day 8 was 1 of the secondary biomarker endpoints. Other secondary biomarker endpoints included change from baseline in other skin biomarkers in target lesions at Day 15 and the biomarker and gene expression level in lesional skin at Day 15 and levels in non-lesional skin at baseline. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included vital signs, AEs, physical examinations and safety laboratory tests. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) was a secondary endpoint. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: The population for the efficacy analysis was the full analysis set (FAS), which included any subject randomized and receiving 1 dose of investigational product. For the lesion TSS, the linear mixed model was used to model the intra-subject change from baseline in TSS between the crisaborole ointment 2% treated lesion and vehicle treated lesion. The model included the fixed effect of visit as factor, and an unstructured variance and covariance matrix was used to model the dependence among the same subjects across different visits. The least squares mean (LSM) of difference and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) was to be presented. The lesion TSS change was statistically significant difference if p-value was <0.05. For secondary efficacy endpoints, the same model was applied. Biomarker: The population for the analysis of the biomarkers was the per protocol analysis set (PPAS), which included any subject receiving 1 dose of investigational product, with both Day 1 and Day 15 biopsies done, and without protocol deviations that were thought to impact the biomarker expression during the vehicle-controlled period. The gene expression data were modeled using a mixed effect model with time, treatment, and treatment by time interaction as fixed effects and a random intercept for each subject. This formulation intrinsically models the subject correlation structure as in the case of a paired t-test, having the advantage that estimation of the main effects was possible even in the presence of missing values. The primary objective, the lesion biomarker change, was superior for the crisaborole treated area if the p-value was <0.05. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Study disposition is summarized in Table S2. A total of 40 subjects were assigned to study treatments. All subjects assigned to study treatments received study drugs (crisaborole 2% and vehicle). There were 13 male and 27 female subjects treated, and the majority of the subjects were White (34 subjects). Subject ages ranged from 18 to 57 years, with a mean of 32.2 years. The mean body mass index was 28.69 kg/m2. Thirty-eight (38 [95%]) subjects completed the study. Baseline target lesion characteristics were balanced across assigned treatments, with most subjects (97.5%) exhibiting moderate lesion severity, based on the ISGA score. Table S2.

Secondary The mean change of TSS in target lesions on Day 8 was -3.3 and -1.2 for crisaborole and vehicle, respectively. Crisaborole 2% was superior to vehicle as the LSM of intra-subject difference was -2.1 with a p-value <0.0001. The mean change of ISGA in target lesions on Day 8 was -1.3 and -0.4 for crisaborole and vehicle, respectively. Crisaborole 2% was superior to vehicle as the LSM of intra-subject difference was -0.9 with a p-value <0.0001. The mean change of ISGA in target lesions on Day 15 was -1.9 and -0.8 for crisaborole and vehicle, respectively. Crisaborole 2% was superior to vehicle as the LSM of intra-subject difference was -1.1 with a p-value <0.0001. A significant improvement in pruritus NRS was observed for the crisaborole treated versus the vehicle treated lesions 1 day after the first application (–1.9 versus –1.0, p-value=0.0188), and the improvement was maintained through Day 15. Crisaborole 2% was superior to vehicle at each time point up to Day 15, with p-values <0.05 Biomarker Results: Primary The primary endpoint of change in key skin biomarkers was reached at Day 15. Statically significant reductions for the crisaborole treatment lesions were observed at Day 15 for all the 7 key biomarkers expressed by TLDA or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). The only exception was IL-13 expressed by TLDA for which the reduction had a p-value of 0.0814, whereas the reduction had a p-value of 0.0122 by QPCR (Table S4). Table S4.

Secondary Reductions of measured key skin biomarkers were observed at Day 8, which were significant for most of the key biomarkers except the CCL18 and IL-13 expressed by TLDA and IL-13 expressed by QPCR, with p-values of 0.1848, 0.4727 and 0.1439, respectively. Multiple biomarkers showed numeric changes in crisaborole treated skin. Inflammatory markers that showed numeric decreases in crisaborole include MMP12, IL-10 and IL-31. In addition, interferon (IFN)- and the cytokine IL-9 showed numeric reductions in crisaborole treated skin. At Day 15, filaggrin (FLG) normalization rate, histological response rate and Keratin 16 improvement rate were higher in the crisaborole 2% treated area compared with the vehicle treated area (56.4% versus 23.1%, 53.8% versus 23.1% and 59.0% versus 41.0%, respectively). Safety Results: In total, 81 AEs were reported in 29 (out of 40) subjects during the course of the study. Eleven (11) of the AEs were considered treatment-related, and none were serious. Two (2) subjects discontinued from the study due to AEs and no subjects had AEs that required dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of treatment. The most frequently reported all-causality TEAEs by Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term were nasopharyngitis (11 subjects) and headache (9 subjects), none were considered treatment-related. The most frequent treatment-related AE was application site pain which was experienced by 7 subjects. Two (2) subjects discontinued from the study due to AEs (treatment-emergent AD events). Both were not treatment-related and reported as resolved. None of the observed laboratory abnormalities were clinically significant. Any clinically significant physical examination findings were to be reported as AEs. Conclusions:  The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in subjects with mild to moderate AD. The crisaborole treated lesions showed a statistically significant reduction in TSS at Day 15 compared with the vehicle treated lesions (-4.5 versus -2.1). Intra-subject difference of TSS change from baseline was -2.4 with a p-value <0.0001.  In subjects with mild to moderate AD, crisaborole 2% was superior to vehicle for the changes from baseline in lesion TSS at Day 8 and lesion ISGA at Day 8 and Day 15.   A significant improvement with crisaborole 2% treatment for pruritus NRS was maintained from 1 day following the first application through Day 15 compared with vehicle.   The primary biomarker endpoint was reached as crisaborole 2% reduced the key skin biomarkers measured at Day 15, and the reduction was significant for the key biomarkers of CCL17 (TLDA), CCL18 (TLDA), CCL22 (TLDA), IL-13 (QPCR, but not TLDA), Keratin 16 (TLDA), PI3 (TLDA) and S100A12 (TLDA).  Crisaborole 2% reduced key skin biomarkers measured at Day 8, and the reduction was significant for CCL17 (TLDA), CCL22 (TLDA), Keratin 16 (TLDA), PI3 (TLDA) and S100A12 (TLDA) but not significant for CCL18 (TLDA), IL-13 (TLDA) and IL-13 (QPCR).  At Day 15, FLG normalization rate, histological response rate and Keratin 16 improvement rate were higher in the crisaborole 2% treated area compared with the vehicle treated area.   Crisaborole ointment 2% was well-tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile in subjects with mild to moderate AD.
