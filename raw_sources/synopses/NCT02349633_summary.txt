Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation Date: 14 May 2015 Study Completion Date: 28 May 2020 (This study was terminated prematurely.) Report Date: 19 October 2020 Previous Report Date(s): Not Applicable Phase of Development: Phase 1/2 Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: The objectives and endpoints are presented in Table S1, Table S2 and Table S3.      METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1/2 study of PF-06747775 as a single agent and in combination with palbociclib and avelumab in patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutant (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall clinical study consisted of a Phase 1 single-agent, dose-escalation and Phase 1b/2 dose-expansion part to determine the single-agent recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PF-06747775 in patients with previously-treated EGFRm NSCLC followed by sequential evaluations of PF-06747775 at the RP2D in 3 different clinical scenarios. Phase 1 was also planned to include a series of pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-studies. In addition, this study also included a Japanese patient lead-in cohort (LIC) to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of PF-06747775 as a single agent in Japanese patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC. This Japanese LIC was planned to consist of 2 cohorts: RP2D tolerability cohort and PK cohort. Due to early study termination, enrollment into the food effect and rifampin drug-drug interaction (DDI) PK sub-study, Cohort 2B and Cohort 3 were not initiated. Most PD/biomarker analyses were also not completed. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Patients with evidence of histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm (exon deletion 19 or exon 21 L858R substitution) NSCLC were enrolled in this study. In Japanese patients-only LIC, locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC patients who progressed on or were intolerant to standard therapy, for which no standard therapy was available or who declined standard therapy were included in this study. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 65 patients were assigned and treated in this study: • 26 patients were treated in the dose escalation part (PF-06747775 doses: 25 mg to 600 mg once daily [QD]); • 29 patients were treated with PF-06747775 200 mg QD, a combined group of PF-06747775 200 mg QD plus sildenafil 25 mg, PF-06747775 200 mg QD plus esomeprazole/itraconazole, Japan LIC and Cohort 1; • 5 patients were treated with PF-06747775 300 mg QD plus sildenafil 25 mg; • 5 patents were treated with PF-06747775 200 mg QD plus palbociclib 100 mg QD (Cohort 2A). All 65 patients permanently discontinued from the study treatment. Thirty-five (53.8%) patients completed the study and 30 (46.2%) patients permanently discontinued from the study. Twenty-five male and 40 female patients were assigned and treated in this study, with the mean (standard deviation) age of 60.8 (11.1) years. A total of 47 (72.3%) patients were Asian. Efficacy Results: Objective Response: No patients achieved a complete response (CR). Twenty-seven (41.5%) patients achieved a partial response (PR). The objective response rate (ORR) (CR+PR) for the overall population without regard to T790M mutation status was 41.5% (90% confidence interval [CI]: 31.2%, 52.5%). Duration of Objective Response (DOR): The median DOR for the overall population was 11.09 (range: 2.70-34.57) months. Overall Survival (OS): The OS analysis included 9 patients in Japan LIC and Cohort 1 from PF-06747775 200 mg QD group. The median OS was not estimable since the majority of patients were censored. The survival probability at 12 months was 87.5% (90% CI: 50.0%, 97.5%). Progression-Free Survival (PFS): The PFS analysis included 29 patients in PF-06747775 200 mg QD group. Of these, 19 (65.5%) patients had objective progression. The medium PFS was 8.1 (90% CI: 5.4, 23.3) months. The probability of being event free at 24 months was 22.8% (90% CI: 9.6%, 39.5%). Pharmacokinetic Results: Dose Escalation: The PK of PF-06747775 was observed to be generally proportional to dose over the range of 25 mg to 600 mg following both single and multiple dose administration; there was no major accumulation or evidence of non-linearity. Sildenafil Sub-Study: The results demonstrated a minor decrease in area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUC ) and maximum inf observed plasma concentration (C ) of sildenafil by approximately 34% and 17%, max respectively, when co-administered with PF-06747775, suggesting potential weak induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A with multiple doses of PF-06747775. Itraconazole Sub-Study: The results demonstrated a slight increase in dose-normalized area under the concentration-time profile from time 0 to time tau (AUC [dn]) and tau dose-normalized C (C [dn]) of PF-06747775 by approximately 16% and 22%, max max respectively, when co-administered with itraconazole, suggesting CYP3A-based metabolism is a contributor to the elimination of PF-06747775 following multiple doses. This degree of increase in PF-06747775 exposure is not expected to be clinically meaningful. Esomeprazole Sub-Study: The results demonstrated a slight decrease in PF-06747775 area under the concentration-time profile from time 0 to time tau (AUC ) and C by approximately 17% and 22%, respectively, when co-administered with esomeprazole, suggesting an increase in gut pH may slightly decrease the absorption of PF-06747775 following oral dosing. This degree of decrease in PF-06747775 exposure is not expected to be clinically meaningful. PF-06747775 in Combination With Palbociclib: There was no evidence of changes in the PK of PF-06747775 when administered in combination with palbociclib 100 mg QD compared to administration alone. Due to the very limited palbociclib concentration data in few patients, no further interpretation is made at this time regarding palbociclib PK behavior when given under this dose regimen in combination with PF-06747775. PF-06747775 in Japanese-Only Patients: The PK of PF-06747775 in Japanese patients was similar between the 2 cohorts (Japan RP2D and Japan PK) following single and multiple dose administration. Safety Results: Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs): No DLTs were observed in the dose escalation cohorts and the Japan LIC. Two patients in Cohort 2A had DLTs. Adverse Events (AEs): All 65 treated patients had at least 1 all-causality treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 61 of them had at least 1 treatment-related TEAE. In the overall population, the most frequently reported all-causality AEs were diarrhea and paronychia. Both diarrhea and paronychia were experienced by 45 (69.2%) patients each and all of these events were considered as treatment-related AEs. Other frequent AEs included rash (39 [60.0%] patients), stomatitis (30 [46.2%] patients), dermatitis acneiform (28 [43.1%] patients) and dry skin (27 [41.5%] patients). Grade 5 AEs were reported for 3 patients, none of which were related to study treatment. The frequency of treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported for this study was low (6 [9.2%] patients). Other safety evaluations: The most frequent shifts from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline for hematology laboratory results were lymphopenia (8 [12.3%] patients) and anemia (5 [7.7%] patients). The most frequent shift from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline for chemistry results was hyponatremia (8 [12.3%] patients). No patients were observed with a post-dose corrected QT for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) ≥500 msec or a maximum increase from baseline of QTcF ≥60 msec. Conclusions: • No DLTs were observed in dose escalation cohorts and Japan LIC. Two patients in Cohort 2A had DLTs. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not determined. • PF-06747775 had a safety profile that was generally tolerable and manageable by dosing interruption, dose reduction, and/or standard medical therapy in patients with advanced EGFRm NSCLC. No notable findings in laboratory parameters and electrocardiogram (ECG) data were reported. • PF-06747775 provided clinically benefit for the total population as evidenced by Investigator-assessed ORR of 41.5% (90% CI: 31.2%, 52.5%) and median DOR of 11.09 (range: 2.70-34.57) months. • Following single and multiple-dose administration, plasma PF-06747775 exposures based on geometric mean AUC (dn) and C (dn) were generally proportional to dose tau max over the range of 25 to 600 mg QD. • In the Japan LIC following repeat oral administration for 11 days (Japan RP2D cohort) and 15 days (Japan PK cohort) in Cycle 1, plasma PF-06747775 exposures (based on AUC [dn] and C [dn]) were similar between the 2 cohorts. tau max • Co-administration of multiple doses of PF-06747775 QD with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) (esomeprazole), a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole), or a sensitive CYP3A substrate (sildenafil), were not associated with clinically meaningful DDIs.
