CSR Version and Report Date: Final CSR Version 1.0; 02 May 2022 Number of Study Center(s) and Investigator(s): A total of 10 participants were enrolled at 1 center in the United States. A list of study center and investigators involved in this study is provided in Appendix 16.1.4.1. Publications: None Study Period: Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 08 October 2021 Study Completion Date (Last Participant Last Visit): 16 December 2021 This study was neither discontinued nor interrupted. Rationale: This study evaluated the effect of zimlovisertib on pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral contraceptive (OC) steroids, in order to select appropriate contraception requirements in Phase 2 studies. Given zimlovisertib teratogenic potential in preclinical toxicity studies and uncertainty in its potential to induce CYP3A4, an enzyme involved in metabolism of OC, it was desired to understand the impact on PK of OC. Objectives, Endpoints, and Statistical Methods: Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 inf extrapolated to infinite time; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to the last time of the last quantifiable concentration; C = maximum observed concentration; CL/F = apparent max clearance; EE = ethinyl estradiol; LN = levonorgestrel; OC = oral contraceptive; PK = pharmacokinetic; t = terminal half-life; T = time for C ½ max max. To assess the effect of zimlovisertib on ethinyl estradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LN) exposures, the natural log transformed AUC and C were analyzed using a mixed effects last max model with treatment as a fixed effect and participant as a random effect. Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (Test-Reference) and corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from the model and were exponentiated to provide estimates of the ratio of adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) and 90% CIs for the ratios. Methodology: This was a Phase 1, fixed-sequence, multiple-dose, open-label study of the effect of multiple-dose zimlovisertib on single dose OC PK in healthy female participants. The study consisted of 2 periods in a single fixed sequence and no washout period. On Period 1 Day 1, participants were planned to be dosed with a single administration of OC in the form of 1 Portia® (EE and LN) or equivalent tablet, orally. OC (EE and LN) PK then was to be assessed at pre-dose and over 48 hours, post OC dosing. Period 1 was immediately followed by Period 2 with no washout, in which participants were to be dosed orally with zimlovisertib 400 mg modified release (MR) once daily (QD) for 9 days followed by administration of a single dose of OC on the morning of Day 10. OC PK was to be assessed zimlovisertib and the single OC dose were to be administered simultaneously within 5 minutes. Dosing with zimlovisertib 400 mg MR QD continue until Day 11. Participants were planned to be discharged on Day 12 after review of safety laboratory by the principal investigator. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): A total of approximately 10 healthy female participants were planned to be enrolled in the study. A total of 10 participants were enrolled and treated in the study. All participants treated with study intervention were included in the safety analysis. All participants with evaluable PK for EE and LN were included in the PK analysis. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Healthy female adult participants were enrolled in this study. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): In this study, zimlovisertib 200 mg MR tablet was provided by Pfizer to the clinical research unit (CRU) in bulk along with individual dosing containers and desiccants for unit dosing. PORTIA® was supplied by the CRU. In Period 1, a single dose of OC in the form of 1 PORTIA® (EE and LN), containing EE 30 µg and LN 150 µg was orally dosed on Day 1. In Period 2, a single dose of combination OC in the form of 1 PORTIA® (EE and LN), containing of EE 30 µg and LN 150 µg was orally dosed on the morning of Day 10 following 9 days of zimlovisertib orally dosed at 400 mg QD. Dosing with zimlovisertib at 400 mg QD continued through until Day 11. The manufacturing lot number for the study intervention dispensed in this study is provided in Table S1. Table S1.

Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: All 10 participants assigned to study treatments were White Hispanic or Latino females. The mean (standard deviation) age was 53.6 (3.86) years, ranging from 46 to 60 years. All participants received study intervention and completed the study. Exposure: In Period 1, all participants were treated with 1 single dose of a combination OC. In Period 2, all participants were treated with zimlovisertib 400 mg QD for 11 days and 1 single dose of a combination OC on Day 10. Safety Results: A total of 4 all-causality AEs were reported in 2 participants following multiple doses of zimlovisertib 400 mg QD, and 1 all-causality AE was reported in 1 participant following multiple doses of zimlovisertib 400 mg QD co-administered with a single dose OC. All AEs were considered not treatment-related. No AEs were reported following the administration of a single dose OC. No SAEs, severe AEs, discontinuations or dose reductions due to AEs were reported in this study. Following the administration of multiple doses of zimlovisertib 400 mg QD, a mild nausea and a mild headache was reported in 1 participant each, a mild pruritus was reported in 2 participants. Following the administration of multiple doses of zimlovisertib 400 mg QD co-administered with a single dose OC, a mild toothache was reported in 1 participant. Following the administration of multiple doses of zimlovisertib 400 mg QD co-administered with a single dose OC, urine hemoglobin positive was reported in 5 participants and leukocyte esterase positive was reported in 2 participants in the urinalysis. No participants with laboratory abnormalities that met the pre-defined criteria for hematology and clinical chemistry analyses. No laboratory abnormalities were considered clinically significant or reported as AEs by the investigator or the sponsor. No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs measurements, ECGs or other observations related to safety were observed in this study. Pharmacokinetic Results: All participants with evaluable PK for EE and LN were included in the analysis. Plasma EE Pharmacokinetics The median plasma concentration-time profiles of EE were similar when a single dose OC was administered alone or co-administered with zimlovisertib 400 mg QD. The median Tmax of EE was 1.50 hours for both treatments. The t values were similar for both treatments with ½ with zimlovisertib 400 mg QD, respectively. Inter-participant variability for AUC and C last max of EE was moderate with geometric %CV ranging between 25% and 38%. When OC was co-administered with zimlovisertib 400 mg QD, AUC , AUC and C last inf max were similar to those when OC was administered alone. The ratio of the adjusted geometric mean (90% CI) AUC , AUC and C of EE following administration of OC with inf last max zimlovisertib relative to OC administered alone were 99.76% (88.15%, 112.90%), 101.43% (93.01%, 110.61%), and 95.07% (84.44%, 107.04%), respectively. Plasma LN Pharmacokinetics Following single oral administration of OC the median plasma LN concentration-time profile was similar when compared to OC co-administered with zimlovisertib. The median T of max LN was 1.00 hour for both treatments. The terminal phase was not well characterized (AUC % >20) for all participants and therefore AUC , CL/F and t were not reported. extrap inf ½ Inter-participant variability for AUC and C was moderate with geometric %CV ranging last max between 39% and 56%. The ratio of the adjusted geometric mean (90% CI) AUC and C of LN following last max administration of OC with zimlovisertib relative to OC administered alone were 108.51% (98.85%, 119.11%) and 117.99% (101.82%, 136.73%). Conclusions: PK  Zimlovisertib did not appear to have a notable impact on the plasma exposure of either EE or LN.  The adjusted geometric mean ratio (%) of test/reference for AUC , AUC and C last inf max values of EE following co-administration with multiple doses of zimlovisertib were 101.43%, 99.76% and 95.07%, respectively.  The adjusted geometric mean ratio (%) of test/reference for AUC and C values of last max LN following co-administration with multiple doses of zimlovisertib were 108.51% and 117.99%, respectively. Safety  All treatments were safe and well-tolerated in healthy female participants. No new safety issues were identified.
