Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This was a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, single-arm, Phase 2 efficacy and safety trial of talazoparib as neoadjuvant therapy in germline breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/2 (gBRCA1/2) mutation positive, early triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the protocol was later amended to include hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer patients. Approximately 112 total patients were to be enrolled in the study, then reduced to 60, and treated with talazoparib 1 mg once daily (QD) for 24 weeks, followed by surgery (within a maximum of 6 weeks of last dose) and assessment for pathological complete response (pCR) by independent central review (ICR). A patient was to participate in up to 4 periods: screening, talazoparib treatment phase, safety follow-up, and long-term follow-up. Figure S1 provides a study schematic. Figure S1. Study Schematic: Single Agent Talazoparib Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of early invasive triple negative or HR positive, HER2-negative adenocarcinoma of the breast with germline BRCA1/2 mutations who were suitable for neoadjuvant therapy were enrolled into the study. Study Treatment: Patients were to receive talazoparib 1 mg QD for 24 weeks, or 0.75 mg QD in case of moderate renal impairment at baseline. Talazoparib was self-administered by mouth at approximately the same time each day outside the clinic, except on days when dose was taken in the clinic after the pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling.

(MDV3800 Capsules) Efficacy Evaluations: The primary efficacy endpoint was the pathological complete response (pCR) by ICR after 24 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery defined as ypT0/Tis ypN0 (the absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast and the axillary lymph nodes on evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy). The secondary efficacy endpoints included pCR (breast and axilla) by investigator, pCR (in breast only) by ICR and investigator, residual cancer burden (RCB) by ICR. pCR and RCB were assessed by histological examination of the post-surgical specimen by ICR. pCR by investigator was assessed by histological examination of the post-surgical specimen. Patient Reported Outcomes, Pharmacokinetic, and Biomarker Evaluations: Patient Reported Outcomes Assessment: global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires. Missed expected menstrual period was assessed electronically using the Patient Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) questionnaire, a patient-reported outcome measure developed to evaluate symptomatic toxicity in patients on cancer clinical trials. PK Evaluations: One 4 mL sample of venous blood was collected in appropriately labeled lavender top dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K EDTA) collection tubes on 2 Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4 before administration of the talazoparib dose on that day. Samples were analyzed using validated analytical methods in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures. Biomarker Evaluations: Tumor samples submitted at Screening were retrospectively sequenced using FoundationOne CDx. Unless prohibited by local regulations or EC decision, saliva samples were collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 before the first dose of study drug treatment for exploratory targeted sequencing of a panel of 16 deoxyribonucleic acid damage repair/response (DDR) genes using Ambry Precision-Next. Blood samples for circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) analyses were collected at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and End of Treatment (EOT) for central laboratory analysis using a targeted sequencing panel including DDR genes. Blood samples were collected at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and EOT for protein biomarker analysis. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: pCR rate by ICR was analyzed and summarized along with the exact 80% and 95% CI based on Blaker's method. pCR rate by investigator was analyzed and summarized along with the exact 95% CI based on Blaker's method. RCB by ICR was reported as a categorical variable with 4 classes (categories): RCB 0 (pCR), I (minimal RCB), II (moderate RCB), III (extensive RCB). Number and percentage of patients for all 4 categories were reported along with exact 95% confidence interval (CI) as per Goodman’s method. pCR rate by ICR in breast was summarized using descriptive statistics along with the exact 95% CI based on Blaker's method. PK: Talazoparib concentration was summarized descriptively by nominal time and talazoparib dose strength. Additionally, a subgroup of PK samples which met pre-defined steady-state acceptance criteria were summarized by nominal time and a within-patient average talazoparib steady-state trough concentration was listed by patient from this population. Patient Reported Outcomes: The results from the endpoints of the instruments (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23, PRO-CTCAE and European Quality of Life 5 Dimension range) at every cycle, as well as these same descriptive statistics based on change from baseline. The proportions of patients who missed expected menstrual periods from the PRO- CTCAE questionnaire was also displayed at each cycle. A graphical display corresponding to the above descriptive results was also provided, both based on the observed values as well as based on change from baseline values. Biomarker: Data from biomarker assays were captured in by-patient listings and summary tables and figures. Correlations of biomarker results with measures of efficacy were performed using methods such as logistic regression as appropriate. RESULTS Patient Disposition and Demography: A total of 61 patients were enrolled and treated in the US. Only patients with gBRCA1/2 mutation positive, early TNBC were enrolled.  Forty-five (73.8%) patients completed the study treatment phase. The primary reason for permanent study drug discontinuation was progressive disease (10 [16.4%] patients). Three (4.9%) patients discontinued treatment due to AEs but continued study. Two (3.3%) patients withdrew consent during treatment; 1 patient completed only 4 months of treatment and decided to have surgery early; the other patient withdrew consent from the treatment and also permanently discontinued from the study. Another patient went to surgery early due to COVID-19 impact in local area.  Forty-nine (80.3%) patients entered and completed safety follow-up 28 days after surgery.  The study was terminated after all patients completed safety follow-up. At time of the study termination, 58 (95.1%) patients had entered the long-term follow-up phase of which 2 (3.3%) had died due to progressive disease and 1 (1.6%) had withdrawn consent. Efficacy Results: The pCR rate was 45.8% (80% CI: 36.42%, 55.22%) as assessed by ICR in the evaluable analysis population after talazoparib treatment for 24 weeks. The posterior probability that the true pCR rate exceeded 45% was 0.55. pCR rate by ICR in the ITT analysis population was 49.2% (80% CI: 40.97%, 57.39%) and the posterior probability was 0.75. The pCR rate as assessed by investigator was 45.8% (95% CI: 31.98%, 60.62%) and 47.5% (95% CI: 35.03%, 60.09%) among patients in the evaluable analysis set and intent to treat analysis population (ITT) analysis set, respectively. When assessed in breast only by ICR, pCR rates were 47.9% (95% CI: 34.11%, 62.75%) in the evaluable analysis set and 50.8% (95% CI: 38.37%, 63.30%) in the ITT analysis set. pCR rates in breast only as assessed by investigator were 45.8% (95% CI: 31.98%, 60.62%) in the evaluable analysis set and 47.5% (95% CI: 35.03%, 60.09%) in the ITT analysis set. Among patients in the evaluable population, 45.8% (95% CI: 29.0%, 63.7%) achieved RCB-0 (pCR). In the ITT population, 49.2% (95% CI: 33.6%, 64.9%) of patients achieved RCB-0 (pCR) and 1.6% (95% CI: 0.2%, 12.6 %) of patients achieved RCB-I (minimal RCB). Patient Reported Outcomes, Pharmacokinetic, and Biomarker Results: Patient Reported Outcomes Results There was generally a deterioration in GHS/QoL and most functioning scales, and an increase in severity in symptoms scales per EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 over the course of the study. Thirty-seven percent and 18% of the patients experienced a definitive deterioration in GHS/QoL and nausea/vomiting, respectively. In both cases the median time to definitive deterioration was not estimable in this study. The number of patients reporting missed menstrual period was low, less than 12% at cycle 4 and less than 8% in all other cycles. Pharmacokinetic Results In dose-compliant PK analysis set, trough plasma talazoparib concentrations were similar for Cycles 2, 3, and 4, with a geometric mean of 5241, 5208, and 4537 pg/mL, respectively, suggesting that talazoparib reached steady-state by Cycle 2. The geometric mean of within-patient average plasma trough concentration at steady state was 5001 pg/mL, and the percent coefficient of variation (CV%) of geometric mean was 65.2. Biomarker Results Fifty-one out of 52 evaluable tumors exhibited mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)1 and/or BRCA2. BRCA loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was seen in 42/43 (98%) BRCA-mutant tumors evaluable for zygosity, consistent with expectations for this BRCA- associated tumor type. Of 45 patients evaluable for both germline and tumor, 44/45 (98%) patients exhibited the same BRCA mutation in tumor as originally detected in germline, with the remaining patient exhibiting a gBRCA1 mutation, but lacking a tumor BRCA mutation. None of 49 patients evaluable for exploratory germline analysis exhibited non-BRCA germline DDR mutations. Overall tumor mutational landscape for non-BRCA genes, including TP53, MYC, RAD21 was consistent with expectations based on literature. No association between pCR rate and mutational status of MYC or RAD21 was found. Low patient numbers and/or subgroup imbalances precluded meaningful assessment of correlations of TP53 mutational status, or of genomic loss of heterozygosity (gLOH) high/low status, with pCR. Safety Results: A total of 98.4% and 95.1% of patients experienced all-causality and treatment-related AEs, respectively. The most frequent treatment-related AEs were fatigue (77.0% patients), nausea (63.9% patients) and alopecia (57.4% patients), which were experienced by more than half of patients. Other common treatment-related AEs were anemia (47.5% patients), headache (31.1% patients), dizziness (19.7% patients) and constipation (18.0% patients). Most AEs specified above (except for anemia) were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Anemia was the most common Grade 3 treatment-related AE (39.3% patients). Three patients permanently discontinued from study treatment due to Grade 3 treatment-related anemia (2) and Grade 3 treatment-related vertigo (1). Anemia was also the primary reason leading to dose reductions (32.8% patients) and temporary discontinuations (26.2% patients). Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 14.8% patients with anemia (14.8% patients) being the most frequent. Anemia is a known AE with talazoparib. No deaths occurred during the reporting period. Laboratory abnormalities in hematology parameters were observed. Eight (13.1%) patients had shifts from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post baseline for anemia laboratory results. Few patients had abnormalities in blood chemistry results and there were few shifts from Grade ≤2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline on chemistry laboratory parameters. Conclusions:  Talazoparib exhibited clinical benefit in the neoadjuvant setting for gBRCA1/2 mutation positive, early TNBC as evidenced by pCR rate (breast and axilla) of 45.8% (80% CI: 36.42%, 55.22%) by ICR in the evaluable analysis set. The study did not meet the pre-defined success criterion as the posterior probability that the true pCR rate by ICR was ≥45% was 0.55.  Talazoparib 1 mg QD was generally well tolerated in patients with early gBRCA 1/2 mutation positive, early TNBC. No new safety signals were identified. The safety profile was generally consistent with the known safety profile for talazoparib.  There was generally a deterioration in GHS/QoL and functionings and an increase in severity in symptoms with the talazoparib treatment. A low proportion of pre-menopausal patients had missed an expected menstrual period suggesting potential preservation of ovarian function with talazoparib treatment.  Trough plasma talazoparib concentrations were similar for Cycles 2, 3, and 4; the geometric mean of within-patient average plasma trough concentration at steady state was 5001 pg/mL.  Tumor BRCA mutations were evident in 98% of evaluable patients, with BRCA LOH evident in all but 1 BRCA-mutated tumor evaluable for zygosity. Overall mutational landscape for non-BRCA genes, including TP53, MYC, RAD21 was consistent with  No association between pCR rate and MYC or RAD21 mutational status was observed. Low patient numbers and/or subgroup numerical imbalances precluded meaningful assessment of correlations of TP53 mutational status, or of gLOH high/low status, with pCR.  These biomarker results support the central role of BRCA mutations in tumor pathobiology in this indication.
