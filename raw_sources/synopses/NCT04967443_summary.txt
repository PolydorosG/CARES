CSR Version and Report Date: Final CSR Version 1.0, 06 July 2022 Number of Study Center(s) and Investigator(s): A total of 72 participants were enrolled at 1 center in the United States. A list of study center and investigators involved in this study is provided in Appendix 16.1.4.1. Publications: None Study Period: Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 22 September 2021 Study Completion Date (Last Participant Last Visit): 15 February 2022 This study was neither discontinued nor interrupted. Rationale: Prazosin is a selective adrenoreceptor antagonist. Minipress® (prazosin hydrochloride [HCl]) is an oral anti-hypertensive indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Pfizer Inc. is the marketing authorization holder for oral prazosin HCl capsules. Currently, prazosin HCl capsules are manufactured at Pfizer Pharmaceuticals limited liability company (LLC), Barceloneta, Puerto Rico (abbreviated as Barceloneta). Pfizer intends to transfer drug Barceloneta site to the proposed new Pfizer Italia Società a responsabilità limitata (S.r.L), Ascoli, Italy, manufacturing site (abbreviated as Ascoli). This bioequivalence study was conducted to qualify the manufacturing site transfer, and the associated process changes, by demonstrating bioequivalence between prazosin HCl capsules manufactured at Barceloneta (Reference Treatment) versus prazosin HCl capsules manufactured at Ascoli (Test Treatment). Objectives, Endpoints, and Statistical Methods: The study objectives and endpoints are presented in Table S1. Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints Natural log transformed PK parameters (AUC , AUC , and C ) were analyzed using a inf last max mixed effect model with sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects and participant within sequence as a random effect. Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (Test – Reference) and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from the model. The adjusted mean differences and the 90% CIs for the differences were exponentiated to provide estimates of the ratio of adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) Bioequivalence of the Test treatment to Reference treatment were to be concluded if the 90% CIs for the ratios of adjusted geometric means for prazosin AUC and C fell last max entirely within the acceptance region of (80%, 125%). Methodology: This study was designed as a 2-cohort, open-label, randomized, single-dose study in healthy adult male and/or female participants. Cohort 1 was a crossover design with 3 treatments, 3 periods and 6 sequences. Cohort 2 was a crossover design with 2 treatments, 2 periods and 2 sequences. Participants in Cohort 1 were randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 sequences (Table S2). Participants in Cohort 2 were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 sequences (Table S3). Table S2. Study Design Overview – Cohort 1 Table S3. Study Design Overview – Cohort 2 Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): Approximately 36 participants were planned to be enrolled in each of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (total 72 participants). Participants enrolled in Cohort 1 were not eligible for Cohort 2 and vice versa. A total of 72 participants were enrolled, with 36 participants randomized and treated in each HCl were included in the safety analyses. All participants with evaluable PK were included in the PK analysis. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Participants enrolled in this study were healthy adult participants. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): Prazosin HCl 2 mg and 5 mg capsules, manufactured at Pfizer Pharmaceuticals LLC, Barceloneta, Puerto Rico and prazosin HCl 1 mg, 2 mg and 5 mg capsules, manufactured at Pfizer Italia S.r.L, Ascoli, Italy were supplied to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) along with individual dosing containers for unit dosing. On Day 1 of each period, participants received a single dose of study intervention as per randomization schedule. Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, study interventions were orally dosed at approximately 0800 hours. The manufacturing lot numbers for the study interventions dispensed in this study are provided in Table S4. Table S4. Study Intervention Information in Protocol A02810006 Duration of Study Intervention: The planned duration of treatment was 1 day each in Periods 1, 2 and 3 for Cohort 1, and 1 day each in Periods 1 and 2 for Cohort 2.

Pharmacokinetic Results: PK Cohort 1: Prazosin HCl 1 × 2 mg (Barceloneta) vs. Prazosin HCl 1 × 2 mg and 2 × 1 mg capsules (Ascoli) Following administration of single oral dose of prazosin HCl 1 × 2 mg capsule (Barceloneta), 1 × 2 mg capsule (Ascoli), and 2 × 1 mg capsules (Ascoli), median T (time to first max occurrence of C ) was 2.00 hours, 2.00 hours, and 1.50 hours, respectively, and mean t max ½ was 5.330, 5.236, and 5.022 hours, respectively. For prazosin HCl 1 × 2 mg manufactured at Ascoli (Test) vs. prazosin HCl 1 × 2 mg capsules manufactured at Barceloneta (Reference), the Test/Reference ratios of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) of AUC and AUC , values were 100.91% (94.92%, 107.27%) and inf last 102.10% (96.14%, 108.43%), respectively. The corresponding 90% CI for the adjusted geometric mean AUC and AUC ratios fell wholly within the bioequivalence boundary of inf last the 80%-125%. The Test/Reference ratios of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) for Cmax was 113.96% (102.79%, 126.34%) and the 90% CI fell slightly outside the upper boundary of the 80%-125% bioequivalence range. Similarly, for prazosin HCl 2 × 1 mg manufactured at Ascoli (Test) vs. prazosin HCl 1 × 2 mg manufactured at Barceloneta (Reference), the Test/Reference ratios of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) of AUC and AUC , were 102.08% (95.97%, 108.57%) and 104.87%, inf last (98.68%, 111.44%), respectively. The 90% CI for the adjusted geometric mean AUC and inf AUC fell wholly within the bioequivalence boundary of the 80%-125%. The last Test/Reference ratio of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) for C was 126.83% (114.32%, max 140.70%) and the 90% CI fell outside the upper boundary of the 80%-125% bioequivalence range. Between-participant variability in area under the curve (AUC) values were similar between the three treatments in Cohort 1, with geometric mean percent coefficient of variation (%CV) values ranging from 31-34%. The between-participant variability in C values were similar max between the two Ascoli treatments with geometric mean %CV values ranging from 36-37%, and slightly higher for the Barceloneta treatment (49%). PK Cohort 2: Prazosin HCl 1×5 mg (Barceloneta) vs. Prazosin HCl 1×5 mg capsules (Ascoli) Following administration of single oral dose of prazosin HCl 1 × 5 mg capsule (Barceloneta) and 1 × 5 mg capsule (Ascoli), median T was 2.50 hours and 2.00 hours, respectively. max Mean t was 4.676 and 4.775 hours, respectively. ½ For prazosin HCl 1 × 5 mg manufactured at Ascoli (Test) vs. prazosin HCl 1 × 5 mg capsules manufactured at Barceloneta (Reference), the Test/Reference ratios (90% CI) of adjusted geometric means of AUC and AUC , were 104.04% (99.09%, 109.23%) and 104.45% inf last (99.58%, 109.55%), respectively. The 90% CI for the adjusted geometric mean AUC and inf AUC fell wholly within the bioequivalence boundary of the 80%-125%. The last Test/Reference ratio of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) for C was 118.07% (106.46%, max 130.94%) and the 90% CI fell outside the upper boundary of the 80%-125% bioequivalence range. Between-participant variability in AUC values were the same for the two treatments in inf Cohort 2 (geometric mean %CV = 37%).
