The treatment duration was 24 weeks, with a screening period of up to 30 days and a follow-up phone call 4 weeks after the last clinic visit. Subjects (also referred to as participants) had been stable on treatment with daily Genotropin for a minimum of 3 months prior to enrollment. They were then randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 sequences, either 12 weeks of treatment with daily Genotropin followed by 12 weeks of treatment with once weekly somatrogon, or 12 weeks of treatment with once weekly somatrogon followed by 12 weeks of treatment with daily Genotropin. Study Treatment: Participants were to administer somatrogon weekly by subcutaneous (SC) injection at approximately the same time on a regularly scheduled day of the week. Participants were to administer Genotropin daily by SC administration at the same time of day as they were injecting their daily growth hormone at the time of screening. Study intervention information is provided in Table S2.  Efficacy Evaluations: Not Applicable. Other Evaluations: The primary and secondary endpoints were as described in Table S1. Safety Evaluations: Safety assessments were based on adverse events (AEs), vital signs, body weight, physical examination, urine pregnancy, and laboratory assessments (including hematology, blood chemistry, liver function, lipid profile, urinalysis, IGF-1 levels, immunogenicity, and somatrogon level). Statistical Methods: Primary Endpoint Analysis: The primary endpoint was analyzed using a linear mixed effects model including sequence, period, and treatment as fixed effects and subject within sequence and within-subject error as random effects. This model was used to obtain the estimate, confidence interval (CI), and p-value for the treatment effect and other effects of interest. The model was used to test the null hypothesis that the difference in Life Interference Total Score between weekly and daily regimens is zero versus the alternative that the difference is less than zero (weekly minus daily). A descriptive summary of Overall Life Interference total score was presented by each treatment period at baseline and at each post-baseline time point. Overall individual item scores were also summarized descriptively. Secondary endpoints Analysis:  For binary data (from the DCOA 2 questionnaire), descriptive statistics included the number of non-missing observations and frequencies of the observed endpoint as well as the observed proportions. When appropriate, a two-sided 95% CI for the corresponding proportion was provided using the Wilson score method.  For categorical endpoints (from the DCOA 2 questionnaire), descriptive statistics included the number of non-missing observations, frequencies and proportions for each category of interest. When appropriate, a two-sided binomial 95% CI for the proportion of a specific category was provided using the Wilson score method.  Continuous endpoints (from the DCOA 1 and PGIS-IDA questionnaires) were analyzed using the method described above for the primary endpoint. In general, missing values on outcomes endpoints were not imputed and did not contribute to the analysis. If no scheduled assessments are performed for a given visit, and if there were unscheduled assessments performed within the visit window, the last available data within the visit window for a given treatment period were used for the analysis. Safety: Descriptive statistics were reported for AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), clinical laboratory measurements, and immunogenicity. Psychometric Properties and Sensitivity of the DCOA Questionnaire The DCOA Life Interference scale score was evaluated through the following analyses: descriptive statistics, item-to-item (inter-item) correlations, corrected item-total correlations, test retest reliability, internal consistency reliability, construct-related validity (tests of convergent and discriminant validity, known groups analysis), ability to detect change, and interpretation of scores (anchor- and distribution-based methods). RESULTS This study was not temporarily stopped and was completed in accordance with the protocol. Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 107 participants were enrolled, of which 87 were randomized (43 participants to the Genotropin then somatrogon sequence and 44 participants to somatrogon then Genotropin sequence). All 87 randomized participants received at least 1 dose of study intervention. Two participants discontinued the study (1 due to an AE during Treatment Period 1; 1 due to a protocol deviation during Treatment Period 2). The safety analysis set was identical to the full analysis set (FAS), which consisted of the 87 participants who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study intervention. The per protocol set (PPS) consisted of 81 participants who completed both treatment periods and the corresponding assessments. Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced across both treatment sequences. The median age of participants was 11 years (range: 3 to 17 years) and 69 [79.3%]) participants were aged ≥ 8 years. Most participants were male (72 [82.8%]) and White (81 [93.1%]). Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done. Other Results: Primary Endpoint: Treatment Burden: Difference in Mean Overall Life Interference Total Scores Between the Weekly Injection Schedule and the Daily Injection Schedule (DCOA 1) This study met the primary endpoint by demonstrating the treatment burden, as evaluated by the Patient Life Interference questionnaire, of the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule was lower than that of the once daily Genotropin injection schedule (Table S3):  The least squares mean of the Overall Life Interference total score was lower for the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule than for the once daily Genotropin injection schedule.  The mean difference (somatrogon-Genotropin) was -15.49 (95% CI: -19.71, -11.27).  The difference in mean Overall Life Interference scores for somatrogon once weekly for 12 weeks, compared with administration of Genotropin once daily for 12 weeks, was statistically significant (p<0.0001). Secondary Endpoints: Treatment Experience: Difference in Mean Scores Between the Weekly Injection Schedule Experience and Daily Injection Schedule Experience – DCOA 1 Questionnaire The estimated mean score differences for most variables within the DCOA 1 questionnaire showed an improvement (ie, negative estimated mean difference) during the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule compared with the once daily Genotropin injection schedule:  These estimated mean score differences (95% CI) were statistically significant (p<0.05)  Pen ease of use: -5.39 (-8.69, -2.09)  Ease of the injection schedule: -13.60 (-19.74, -7.45)  Convenience of the injection schedule: -24.34 (-30.10, -18.57)  Willingness to continue injection schedule: -17.60 (-25.15, -10.06)  Caregiver life interference (including Family life interference): -13.47 (-17.59, -9.35)  Missed injections: -2.76 (-5.16, -0.36).  The point estimate of the mean [model-based mean (95% CI)] satisfaction with the overall treatment experience score was lower (ie, improved) for participants in the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule [21.13 (14.61, 27.65)] than for participants in the once daily Genotropin injection schedule [28.95 (22.55, 35.36)]; however, the estimated mean difference was not statistically significant (p=0.0739).  Overall mean scores were similar between both injection schedules for injection signs and symptoms (for participants 8 years and above: 13.6 for both injection schedules) and the assessment of signs (as reported by the caregiver for the children aged <8 years: 9.4 for the once daily Genotropin injection schedule and 9.7 for the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule). Proportion of Participant/Caregiver Dyads Responding to the DCOA 2 Questionnaires at Week 24  Choice of injection pen: A larger proportion of participant/caregiver dyads (ie, lower bound of 95% CI >50%) selected the once weekly injection pen (somatrogon: 74 [88.1%] participants, 95% CI: 79.5, 93.4) compared with those who selected the once daily injection pen (Genotropin: 10 [11.9%] participants). For the DCOA 2 questions that asked participant/caregiver dyads to compare both injection schedules, a larger proportion of those dyads (ie, lower bound of 95% CI > 50%) selected the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule compared with those who selected the once daily Genotropin injection schedule or expressed no difference between the injection schedules for the following DCOA 2 variables, except for Ease of Injection Schedule.  Preferred injection schedule: somatrogon: 77 (91.7%) participants, (95% CI: 83.8, 95.9); Genotropin: 6 (7.1%) participants; no preference: 1 (1.2%) participant.  Convenience of injection schedule: somatrogon: 80 (95.2%) participants (95% CI: 88.4, 98.1); Genotropin: 4 (4.8%) participants; no difference: 0 participants.  Easier to follow: somatrogon: 72 (85.7%) participants (95% CI: 76.7, 91.6); Genotropin: 8 (9.5%) participants; no preference: 4 (4.8%) participants.  Choice of injection pen – easier to use: A larger proportion of participant/caregiver dyads reported the somatrogon pen was easier to use compared with those who selected the Genotropin pen or expressed no difference based on preparing the injection pen: somatrogon: 54 (64.3%) participants (95% CI: 53.6, 73.7); Genotropin: 7 (8.3%) participants; no difference: 23 (27.4%) participants.  However, these proportions were less than 50% for the 3 items of setting the dose, injecting the medicine, and storing the pen. The proportion of these dyads who indicated there was no difference in these items between the 2 pens ranged from 29.8% to 64.3%.  Patient life interference (5 items): somatrogon: 66 (78.6%) participants (95% CI: 68.7, 86.0) to 73 (86.9%) participants (95% CI: 78.1, 92.5); Genotropin: 2 (2.4%) to 3 (3.6%) participants; no difference: 8 (9.5%) to 15 (17.9%) participants.  Caregiver life interference (5 items): somatrogon: 67 (79.8%) participants (95% CI: 70.0, 87.0) to 72 (85.7%) participants (95% CI: 76.7, 91.6); Genotropin: 1 (1.2%) to 2 (2.4%) participants; no difference: 10 (11.9%) to 15 (17.9%) participants.  Family life interference (5 items): somatrogon: 61 (72.6%) participants (95% CI: 62.3, 81.0) to 67 (79.8%) participants (95% CI: 70.0, 87.0); Genotropin: 1 (1.2%) participants; no difference: 16 (19.0%) to 22 (26.2%) participants.  Benefit relating to the injection schedule: Most of the participant/caregiver dyads, regardless of treatment sequence, responded it would be extremely beneficial (48 [57.1%]) or very beneficial (25 [29.8%]) to take injection less often.  Intention to comply (4 items): somatrogon: 57 (67.9%) participants (95% CI: 57.3, 76.9) to 69 (82.1%) participants (95% CI: 72.6, 88.9); Genotropin: 2 (2.4%) to 5 (6.0%) participants; no difference: 13 (15.5%) to 22 (26.2%) participants. Patient Global Impression at Week 12 and Week 24 The overall mean PGIS-IDA score was significantly lower for participants in the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule than for participants in the once daily Genotropin injection schedule with an estimated mean score difference (95% CI) of -14.58 (-18.72, -10.44), p <0.0001. Psychometric Properties of DCOA Questionnaires Life Interference 7-Item and Scale Score Distribution At baseline, the Life Interference scale scores ranged from 0 to 78.6 and the mean [SD] was 28.4 [18.8]. At Week 12, the Life Interference scale scores ranged from 0 to 60.7 and the mean [SD] was 16.2 [16.0]. At Week 24, the Life Interference scale scores ranged from 0 to 82.1 and the mean [SD] was 15.5 [19.4] Inter-item Correlations Results from the Life Interference Pearson inter-item correlation analyses showed correlations (r >0.70) between Item 4 (interference with spending the night away from home) and Item 5 (interference with travel) at baseline, Week 12, and Week 24; Item 2 (interference with social activities) and Item 1 (interference with usual daily activities) at Week 24; and Item 2 (interference with social activities) and Item 3 (interference with recreation and leisure activities) at Week 24. Although medium (r=0.30-0.49) to strong (≥ 0.50) relationships existed among some other items, all were r <0.70 across timepoints and no item correlations suggested redundancy (r >0.80). Similar results were generally observed for Spearman (ρ) inter-item correlations. Correlated Item-Total Corrections All Life Interference items correlated (Pearson [r] and Spearman [ρ] ≥0.40) with the total Life Interference scale score at all timepoints, except for Item 7 (bothered by growth hormone injections) at Week 12. Score Reliability (Internal Consistency and Test-Retest Reliability) Internal consistency reliability results showed that the Life Interference scale score exceeded Cronbach’s α>0.70 threshold for group-level comparisons at baseline (α=0.814), Week 12 (α=0.807), and Week 24 (α=0.896). Test retest reliability results for the Life Interference scale showed ICC>0.70 for analyses that used data from the more limited sample of participants (ie, participants in the once daily Genotropin injection schedule at Week 12 and those in the once daily Genotropin injection schedule at Week 24), yet lower for analyses conducted using data from the other defined test-retest analysis populations in this study (TRT 1 through TRT-4). Construct-Related Validity Tests of Convergent and Discriminant Validity At baseline, the Life Interference scale score demonstrated strong correlations (r ≥0.50) with Ease of the Injection Schedule, Caregiver Life Interference, Family Life Interference, total Caregiver Life Interference/Family Life Interference, and PGIS-IDA; moderate correlations (r=0.30 to r=0.49) with the Pen Ease of Use, Satisfaction and Willingness to Continue Treatment, and Willingness to Continue; and weak to negligible correlations (r=0.00 to r=0.29) with Satisfaction with Overall Experience, Signs and Symptoms (ie, injection signs and symptoms reported by the participant), Caregiver-Reported Symptoms, and Missing Injections. Similar results were generally observed at Weeks 12 and 24. Results were similar for the Spearman (ρ) correlations. Tests of Known Groups Validity The Life Interference scale scores differed significantly at baseline for participants reporting differing levels of: severity of impact on daily activities due to treatment based on the PGIS IDA (p <0.001); convenience of the injection schedule based on the DCOA Convenience item (p <0.001); and satisfaction based on the DCOA Satisfaction item (p=0.011). A similar pattern of results was observed at Weeks 12 and 24. Ability to Detect Change Overall, the Life Interference scale score decreased from baseline to Week 12, and from Week 12 to Week 24. Strong correlations (r >0.50) were observed between the change scores of the Life Interference scale score and the Ease of the Injection Schedule, Caregiver Life Interference, and the total Caregiver Life Interference/Family Life Interference at Week 12. Moderate to strong (r=0.3 to r=0.49) correlations were observed between the change scores of the Life Interference scale score with the Pen Ease of Use, Satisfaction and Willingness to Continue Treatment, and Family Life Interference scale scores, and PGIS-IDA at Week 12. Negligible to weak correlations (r <0.3) were observed between the change scores of the Life Interference scale score with the Satisfaction with the Overall Experience, Signs and Symptoms, and Caregiver-Reported Signs. Similar results were generally observed for correlations of change scores from Week 12 to Week 24. Interpretation of Scores Overall, results from the anchor-based analyses indicated that participants who experienced a 1-point (out of 7 points) improvement on the PGIS-IDA (defined as minimally improved) had experienced a mean [SD] improvement of the Life Interference scale score of -18.8 [16.4] points from baseline to Week 12. Linear regression approach showed that a 1-unit change in the PGIS-IDA corresponds to a change score of -18.3 in the Life Interference scale score and a 2-unit change in the PGIS IDA corresponds to a change score of -25.8 in the Life Interference scale score. The estimate based on the half SD [SEM] of assessment of Life Interference scores at baseline was 9.4 [15.7]. Safety Results: The proportion of participants with all-causality treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was higher during the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule than during the once daily Genotropin injection schedule (Table S4). A similar trend was observed in the treatment-related TEAEs.  All TEAEs were mild or moderate; none were severe.  No participants reported any SAEs and 1 participant discontinued the study due to an AE (injection site pain of moderate severity during the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule that was considered by the investigator to be related to study intervention).  No deaths were reported during this study.  Three participants had a temporary discontinuation due to an AE (during the once daily Genotropin injection schedule).  No participants reported any AEs related to COVID-19. The most frequently reported all-causality TEAE by System Organ Class (SOC) was Infections and Infestations (18 [20.7%] participants during the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule; 19 [22.1%] during the once daily Genotropin injection schedule). The number of participants who experienced at least 1 injection site reaction AE (General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions System Organ Class [SOC]) was higher during the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule (19 [21.8%]]) than during the once daily Genotropin injection schedule (14 [16.3%]).  Injection site pain and injection site haematoma were the most frequently reported Preferred Terms (PTs) during both injection schedules.  All injection site reaction AEs were mild, except for 2 participants who reported moderate events of injection site pain during the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule.  Except for 1 participant, none of these injection site reactions resulted in study discontinuation.  All of these injection site reaction events were considered by the investigator to be related to the study intervention. No clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups were observed for chemistry, hematology, liver function test, IGF-1 and IGF-1 SDS, glucose metabolism, and urinalysis No participant in either treatment sequence met the criteria for Hy’s Law or Temple’s Corollary. Four participants in the somatrogon then Genotropin sequence tested positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) during the first 12 weeks of Treatment Period 1, but none of these participants tested positive for neutralizing antibodies (NAb) during the study. Conclusion(s):  In this study, the treatment burden, as assessed by the difference in the mean Overall Life Interference total scores, was lower for children with GHD and their caregivers during the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule than during the once daily Genotropin injection schedule.  Improvements in most variables for treatment experience, as assessed by estimated differences in mean score within the DCOA 1 questionnaire, were also observed during the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule compared with the once daily Genotropin injection schedule. o The point estimate of the mean satisfaction with the overall treatment experience improved for participants and their caregivers in the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule compared with those in the once daily Genotropin injection schedule, but the estimated mean difference was not statistically significant. o No differences between injection schedules were observed for injection signs and symptoms (participants ≥8 years) and assessment of signs (participants <8 years).  The majority of participant/caregiver dyads preferred the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule compared with those who preferred the once daily Genotropin injection schedule or no difference/no preference between injection schedules for most variables within the DCOA 2 questionnaire, except for: o Pen ease of use : Although the majority of participant/caregiver dyads reported the somatrogon pen was easier to use based on preparing the pen, less than half of them indicated the somatrogon pen was easier to use for setting the dose, injecting the medicine, and storing the pen.  Most of the participant/caregiver dyads responded it would be extremely or very beneficial to take injection less often.  The once weekly somatrogon injection schedule had less impact on the daily activities than the once daily Genotropin injection schedule based on the lower In this study, once weekly somatrogon administration was generally well tolerated in children with GHD.  Common AEs for both injection schedules included injection site pain, injection site haematoma, nasopharyngitis, and headache. The incidence of common AEs was comparable for both injection schedules, except for injection site haematoma, which was higher for participants in the once daily Genotropin injection schedule. No participant reported a severe TEAE.  No SAEs or deaths were reported during this study.  The incidence of injection site reactions was higher for participants in the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule than for those in the once daily Genotropin injection schedule. All but 2 events were mild and only 1 participant discontinued from the study due to an AE of injection site pain that occurred while receiving somatrogon.  No clinically meaningful differences were observed for laboratory parameters. No participants met the criteria for Hy’s Law or Temple’s Corollary.  Four participants tested positive for somatrogon ADA while receiving once weekly somatrogon therapy; none of these subjects developed NAb.
