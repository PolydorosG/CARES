METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1 randomized, crossover study in healthy participants to estimate the rBA of abrocitinib oral suspension (Test formulation) compared to commercial BA of the commercial tablet formulation was evaluated by administering abrocitinib 200 mg commercial tablet with or without famotidine 40 mg tablet as an ARA (Part A). Assessment of taste and palatability of six different abrocitinib suspensions was also performed to guide the selection and development of abrocitinib pediatrics oral suspension formulation (Part B). Part A of the study was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, crossover, 3-treatment, 6-sequence, 3-period design in healthy male and/or female adult participants (18-55 years) (Table S2). In Part A, participants were randomized to receive one of the following: a single 200 mg dose of abrocitinib commercial tablet (Treatment A), a single 200 mg dose of abrocitinib oral suspension formulation 1 (Treatment B), or famotidine (40 mg tablet) administered 120 minutes before a single 200 mg dose of abrocitinib commercial tablet (Treatment C). All participants were fasting for at least 10 hours before taking abrocitinib. Table S2.

Pharmacokinetic and Other Evaluations: Blood samples of approximately 6 mL, to provide approximately 3 mL of plasma, were collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of abrocitinib and its metabolites PF-06471685 (M1), PF-07055087 (M2), and PF-07054874 (M4). Plasma samples were analyzed using validated analytical methods in compliance with applicable standard operating procedures (SOPs). The following PK parameters for the parent abrocitinib and its circulating metabolites PF-06471658 (M1), PF-07055087 (M2), and PF-07054874 (M4), as applicable, were calculated for each participant using noncompartmental analysis of concentration-time data. PK parameters for abrocitinib and its metabolites are described in Table S6. The unbound PK Parameters (AUC , AUC and C ) for the active moiety were also calculated for inf,u last,u max,u each participant. Samples below the lower limit of quantitation were set to 0 ng/mL for the PK analysis. Actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis. Table S6.

The molecular weight of abrocitinib is 323.4 g/mol. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included AE monitoring, physical examinations, vital signs, ECG assessments, safety laboratory measurements, COVID-19 specific assessments and pregnancy testing. Taste Sensory Attributes Evaluations: Participants recorded the sensory attributes at timed intervals of 0 (immediately after dosing), 5, 10 and 20 minutes after swallowing the suspension, using a Taste Assessment Questionnaire. Taste questionnaire and instructions were reviewed with participants prior to the first taste assessment on Period 4, Day 1. Statistical Methods: Pharmacokinetics Analysis Precision of the estimate of PK parameters were determined by constructing 90% confidence intervals (CIs) around the estimated difference between the Test and Reference treatments using a mixed effects model based on natural log transformed data. The mixed effects model was implemented using SAS Proc Mixed, with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation method and Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom algorithm. Safety Analysis A set of summary tables split by treatment and by Part A, Part B and Part (A+B) were produced to evaluate any potential risk associated with the safety and toleration of administering study treatments. Taste Sensory Attributes Analysis Data for taste assessment used in the analysis was transcribed and rescaled to a score from 0 to 100 from the raw measurements on the questionnaire. The taste analysis set was used for presenting this data. The sensory attributes (overall liking, mouthfeel, bitterness, tongue/mouth burn, sourness, saltiness, sweetness) from the taste questionnaires were listed and descriptively summarized by prototype formulation, and question across participants. Summary statistics (mean and 90% CI) were calculated for the various questions. Radar plots for each of 4 time points, summarizing all attributes for each treatment were generated. Boxplots of each attribute were plotted against the time points. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 19 participants were enrolled into the study, and 18 of them completed the study. One participant discontinued from study due to self-discontinuation by the participant. Of all 19 participants enrolled, 14 were male with most participants (14/19, 73.7%) being 26-44 years, and nearly half of them (9/19, 47.4%) were White and 8 (42.1%) were Black or African American. Participants had median age of 38 years and median BMI of 25.4 kg/m2 (range: 21.1 to 30.2 kg/m2). Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done for this study. Pharmacokinetic and Other Results: PK results: Plasma abrocitinib PK: concentration-time profile of administration of abrocitinib 200 mg commercial tablet vs abrocitinib 200 mg oral suspension formulation 1 Median abrocitinib plasma concentrations were similar when abrocitinib was given as a single commercial tablet and when given as a suspension formulation 1. The ratios of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) for the suspension (test) and tablet (reference) were 96.96% (85.43%, 110.03%) for AUC and 100.07% (80.28%, 124.74%) for C (Table S7). inf max Plasma abrocitinib PK: concentration-time profile of administration of abrocitinib 200 mg commercial tablet vs famotidine tablet 40 mg + abrocitinib 200 mg commercial tablet Median abrocitinib plasma concentrations were lower when abrocitinib was co-administered with famotidine with a decrease in median C observed compared to when abrocitinib was max administered alone. The ratios of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) for abrocitinib AUCinf and C were 62.87% (54.85%, 72.07%) and 15.53% (12.46%, 19.36%), decreased by max approximately 37% and 84%, respectively, when abrocitinib was administered with famotidine (test) as compared to its administration alone (reference) (Table S7). vs. Abrocitinib 200 mg commercial tablet Plasma PK for Circulating Metabolites: PF-06471658 (M1), PF-07055087 (M2) and PF-07054874 (M4) The ratios of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) AUC and C were 87.29% (77.76%, inf max 98.00%) and 26.47% (21.40%, 32.75%), respectively, for PF-06471658 (M1), 80.19% (64.25%, 100.08%) and 26.32% (21.59%, 32.09%), respectively, for PF-07055087 (M2), and 70.62 (61.66%, 80.88%) and 22.19% (18.26%, 26.95%), respectively, for PF-07054874 (M4), decreased between 13%-29% and 74%-78%, for AUC and C , respectively, when inf max abrocitinib was administered with famotidine (test) as compared to its administration alone (reference). The metabolite-to-parent exposure ratios (ratio of metabolite to parent for AUCinf [MRAUC ], ratio of metabolite to parent for AUC [MRAUC ] and ratio of metabolite to inf last last parent for C [MRC ]) for all 3 metabolites increased when abrocitinib was administered max max with famotidine compared to its administration alone. The unadjusted geometric mean ratios (MRAUC , MRAUC and MRC ) in participants who received abrocitinib with inf last max famotidine (test) compared to those who received abrocitinib alone (reference) were 1.308 1.355, and 1.523, respectively, for PF-06471658 (M1), 1.214, 1.178, and 1.574, respectively, for PF-07055087 (M2) and 1.148, 1.111, and 1.468, respectively, for PF-07054874 (M4). Plasma PK for Active Moiety The unbound exposure of the active moiety decreased following co-administration of abrocitinib with famotidine compared to abrocitinib alone. The ratio of the adjusted geometric means (90% CI) for the active moiety when abrocitinib is administered with famotidine (test) compared to when administered alone (reference) was 80.08% (60.52%, 105.94%) for AUC and 18.22% (15.26%, 21.75%) for C , decreased by approximately inf,u max,u 20% and 82%, respectively (Table S8). Assessment of Taste sensory Attributes: Overall, formulations 1, 3, 4 (formulations with sucralose) were more favorable than formulations 2, 5, 6 (formulations without sucralose) at 4 time points based on all taste sensory attributes. In formulations with different sucralose concentrations, no meaningful difference in all sensory attributes was observed between formulation 3 (with 1.5 mg/mL of sucralose) and formulation 4 (with 3.0 mg/mL of sucralose). By adding strawberry flavor to the formulation, similar results were observed when formulation 1 (adding strawberry flavor + sucralose) was administered compared to formulation 3 (adding sucralose alone). Also, the addition of different levels of strawberry flavor showed, as demonstrated by the administration of formulation 5 (with 1.0 mg/mL of strawberry flavor) compared to formulation 6 (with 2.0 mg/mL of strawberry flavor), no meaningful difference in all sensory attributes was observed. Safety Results: Brief Summary of AEs: In Part A, 11 all-causality TEAEs were reported in 6 (33.3%) participants who received abrocitinib 200 mg commercial tablets; 5 TEAEs reported in 3 (16.7%) participants were considered treatment-related. A total of 14 all-causality TEAEs were reported in 8 (44.4%) participants who received abrocitinib 200 mg oral suspension formulation 1; 7 TEAEs reported in 5 (27.8%) participants were considered treatment-related. A total of 7 all-causality TEAEs were reported in 6 (33.3%) participants who received famotidine 40 mg tablet + abrocitinib 200 mg commercial tablet, none of which were considered In Part B, a total of 10 all-causality TEAEs were reported in 5 (55.6%) participants who received abrocitinib 200 mg oral suspension formulations (1-6); 5 TEAEs reported in 4 (44.4%) participants were considered treatment-related. A total of 3 all-causality TEAEs were reported in 2 (20%) participants who received famotidine 40 mg + abrocitinib 200 mg oral suspension formulations (1-6), none of TEAEs were considered treatment-related. No SAEs, severe AEs, study discontinuations due to AEs, dose reductions nor temporary discontinuations were reported during the study. Nausea AEs In total, of all 45 evaluable participants administrated with abrocitinib alone, 12 (26.7%) participants reported nausea, comparing to 0 out of 28 participants administrated with abrocitinib + famotidine. There were no clinically significant laboratory value findings, vital signs findings, ECGs findings, or physical examinations findings observed. Conclusions:  For abrocitinib 200 mg given as suspension (test) versus tablet (reference), the ratios of adjusted geometric means (90% CI) were 96.96% (85.43%, 110.03%) for AUCinf and 100.07% (80.28%, 124.74%) for C with the 90% CIs for both AUC and C max inf max ratios contained within the bioequivalence limits of (80%, 125%).  Co-administration of a single 40 mg dose of famotidine decreased abrocitinib AUCinf and C by approximately 37% and 84%, respectively, relative to a single 200 mg max abrocitinib dose given alone. The AUC and C of the metabolites PF-06471658 inf max (M1), PF-07055087 (M2), and PF-07054874 (M4) decreased between 13%-29% and 74%-78%, respectively, when abrocitinib was co-administration with famotidine compared to when abrocitinib was given alone.  The AUC and C of the active moiety decreased following co-administration of inf,u max,u abrocitinib with famotidine by approximately 20% and 82%, respectively, relative to when abrocitinib was given alone. The ratio of the adjusted geometric means (90% CI) for the active moiety when abrocitinib is administered with famotidine (test) and abrocitinib alone (reference) was 80.08% (60.52%, 105.94%) for AUCinf,u and 18.22% (15.26%, 21.75%) for C . max,u  Overall, based on the results of the taste sensory attributes questionnaire, formulations 1, 3, 4 (formulations with sucralose) were more favorable to study participants than formulations 2, 5, 6 (formulations without sucralose).  Increasing sucralose concentration to 3 mg/mL in formulation 4 did not appear to flavor to sucralose (formulation 1) showed similar preference from study participants compared to formulation 3 without strawberry flavor.  Administration of abrocitinib with ARA (famotidine) had a lower rate in having nausea, compared with administration of abrocitinib alone, as no incidence of nausea was reported in participants administrated with abrocitinib +ARA (famotidine), while 26.7% of participants administrated with abrocitinib alone were reported with nausea, indicating that the decrease in C as a result of increasing gastric pH after max administering an ARA with abrocitinib helps in mitigating nausea.  Single doses of abrocitinib 200 mg, administrated with or without ARA (famotidine), was generally safe and well-tolerated in healthy adult participants in this study. There were no deaths or SAEs in this study, and all TEAEs were mild in severity, except for one TEAE which was moderate in severity.  No clinically significant findings in vital signs, ECG or physical examinations were observed.
