Primary and Secondary Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, multiple-dose, safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) study of PF-06804103 in adult patients with HER2-positive solid tumors (breast cancer [BC] and GC [Part 1A only]) and in postmenopausal patients with HR-positive HER2 IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- BC. Parts 1A and 1B evaluated escalating doses of PF-06804103 as monotherapy and as part of a combination regimen, respectively. Part 2A evaluated selected doses of PF-06804103 in expansion cohorts as monotherapy in HER2+ solid tumors and HR+ HER2-Low BC patients. Part 2B had not enrolled prior to the Approximately 148 participants were expected to be enrolled in the study overall. The actual number of participants enrolled depended on the tolerability of PF-06804103 and the number of dose levels required to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select dose levels for Part 2 of the study. A total of 95 participants were enrolled. The overall study design is presented in Figure S1. Figure S1. Overall Study Design Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: The study enrolled male or female patients age ≥18 years with HER2+ solid tumors (BC and GC) in Part 1A, and postmenopausal patients with HR+ HER2Low BC in Part 1B. In Part 2A, HER2+ and HR+ HER2Low female BC patients were enrolled. Study Treatment: Participants had the option to be pre-treated with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine (or other antihistamine) approximately 0.5 to 2 hours before each PF-06804103 administration. Suggested starting doses were 650 mg to 1000 mg acetaminophen and 50 mg diphenhydramine (or equivalent of other antihistamine) intravenous (IV) or oral. In all study parts, PF-06804103 was administered on Day 1 of each cycle, intravenously over time from Day 1 dose to the next Day 1 dose. If there were no treatment delays, a cycle was 21 days for monotherapy dosing and 28 days for combination regimen dosing. The investigational product description is presented in Table S2. Table S2.

DR A total of 24 participants with confirmed CR or PR were assessed. In Part 1A, the median DR were 7.6 months in 3 confirmed GC responders and 7.0 months in 5 confirmed BC responders. In Part 2A, the median DR were 2.9 months in 2 confirmed HER2+ BC responders and 4.4 months in 2 confirmed HR+ HER2-Low BC responders. In participants with HER2+ BC (Part 1A+2A), only 1 confirmed responder receiving PF-06804103 3 mg/kg had the longest DR of 18.9 months; 5 confirmed responders receiving PF-06804103 4 mg/kg had the median DR of 7.0 months (range: 2.4, 18.7). In Part 1B, the only participant with PR was censored due to withdrawal of consent. PFS Among the 95 participants, 44 (46.3%) participants had an event of disease progression. The estimated median PFS was 5.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2, 7.1) months. In Part 1A, the estimated median PFS was 5.4 (95% CI: 3.9, 8.2) months. In Part 2A, the estimated median PFS was 5.5 (95% CI: 2.9, 5.8) months. In Part 1B, both participants were censored due to withdrawal of consent. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Immunogenicity Results: Pharmacokinetic Results PF-06804103 PK properties were investigated by analyzing 3 analytes including PF-06804103 (ADC, measured as conjugated antibody), total antibody and PF-06380101 (unconjugated payload) following monotherapy (once every 3 weeks [Q3W]) and combination therapy (once every 2 weeks [Q2W]) IV infusion regimens. The exposure of all 3 analytes increased in a dose dependent manner following single and multiple dosing, and dose accumulation was minimal following repeated dosing. After Q3W IV infusion, arithmetic mean terminal serum half-life (t ) values of PF-06804103 ½ (ADC) ranged between 4 to 5 days at dose levels ≥3 mg/kg. Volume of distribution at steady state (V ) values indicate that distribution of PF-06804103 (ADC) is mainly limited to the ss vascular compartment. Drug accumulation values was minimal following repeated dosing with mean observed accumulation ratio based on AUC (R ) values ≤1.16. Inter-participant tau ac variability for PF-06804103 (ADC) exposure based on coefficient of variation (CV)% ranged from 11% to 38% for area under the serum concentration-time profile from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUC ) (Cycle 1), 23% to 33% for area under the inf concentration-time profile from time 0 to time tau (AUC ) (Cycle 4) and 7%-29% for tau maximum observed serum concentration (C ). max Arithmetic mean t values of total antibody ranged between 4 to 6 days for dose levels ½ ≥3 mg/kg. V values indicate that distribution of total antibody is mainly limited to the ss vascular compartment. Drug accumulation based on dose normalized AUC for total tau antibody was minimal following repeated dosing, with mean R value ≤1.12. ac Inter-participant variability for total antibody exposure based on CV% ranged from 38%-62% for AUC (Cycle 1), 18%-32% for AUC (Cycle 4) and 9%-34% for C . The t of the unconjugated payload (arithmetic mean ranged between 4 to 6 days for dose ½ levels ≥3 mg/kg) is similar to that of ADC and total antibody, suggesting linker cleavage is the rate limiting step for payload disposition. Median T of the unconjugated payload max ranged between 3-6 days. Drug accumulation value was minimal following repeated dosing with mean R value ≤1.08. Inter-participant variability for PF-06380101 exposure based on ac CV% ranged from 43% to 83% for AUC (Cycle 1), 19% to 124% for AUC (Cycle 4) and inf tau 15% to 108% for C . max Limited data are available from Q2W combination cohort (n=2). Biomarker Results A total of 61 (65.6%) participants were diagnosed as HER2 positive prior to enrollment based on diagnostic IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing. Participant samples in Study C0541001 were analyzed for the expression of HER2 using 3 distinct assays. Samples were analyzed retrospectively for HER2 expression by IHC at Histogenex using an IVD (Ventana Pathway ANTI-HER-2/NEU [4B5]) to confirm the expression status noted in the original pathology report. The HER2 result in the original pathology report was used to enroll participants into HER2 positive cohorts and HER2 negative cohorts in Part 2A. The definition of HER2 positive and HER2 negative was based on current CAP/ASCO criteria for HER2 positivity. A total of 62 participants had screening samples assayed to confirm their HER2 status. A total of 10 participants also had a C3D1 sample analyzed for HER2 status to confirm post-treatment HER2 expression. These samples were either primary resection or core needle biopsies from metastatic lesions. The HER2 expression status did not change between screening and C3D1 in these 10 participants. Participants samples (either archival or de novo) that were ‘equivocal’ by IHC were analyzed retrospectively at Histogenex using an IVD FISH assay (Abbot Molecular PathVysion HER2 DNA probe kit) to determine the presence or absence of genomic amplification of the ERBB2 gene. This testing was to confirm HER2 status as reported in the original pathology report. A total of 24 participants samples were subjected to this test. These samples were either primary resection or core needle biopsies from metastatic lesions. This reflex testing confirmed the HER2 status of the patients determined from the retrospective IHC analysis. In addition, samples from participants enrolled in Part 2A were analyzed retrospectively for HER2 expression using a novel more sensitive IHC assay with the ability to detect a more granular expression level of HER2. Samples from 42 participants were analyzed using this assay. These samples were either primary resection or core needle biopsies from metastatic lesions. This assay scored for the complete and incomplete percentage of membrane staining at three intensity levels (1+/2+/3+) and reported the heterogeneity of those intensity scores as a percentage of the total staining in the sample (an H-score). The test is shown to be more sensitive as it detects expression levels of HER2 that the IVD cannot detect. Immunogenicity Results After the treatment, 16 out of 88 evaluable participants (18.2%) tested positive for ADA; and 4 of them (4.5%) tested positive for NAb. All of the ADA and NAb cases were treatment-induced. Safety Results: Of the 1121 all-causality treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 95 (100%) participants, 731 were considered to be treatment-related. All participants had at least 1 TEAE, whereas 89 (93.7%) participants had treatment-related AEs. The most frequently reported all-causality TEAEs were alopecia (45.3%), fatigue (41.1%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (32.6%), myalgia (31.6%), constipation (30.5%) and rash (30.5%). A total of 59 (62.1%) participants had Grade 3-4 TEAEs reported. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 events were fatigue (7.4%), hyponatraemia (6.3%), asthenia (5.3%), hypokalaemia (5.3%), intestinal obstruction (5.3%), neuropathy peripheral (5.3%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (5.3%). The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs were alopecia (45.3%), fatigue (33.7%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (31.6%), myalgia (30.5%), rash (27.4%), arthralgia (23.2%), decreased appetite (23.2%), neuropathy peripheral (22.1%), weight decreased (21.1%) and stomatitis (20.0%). A total of 46 (48.4%) participants had treatment-related Grade 3-4 AEs reported. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 events were fatigue (7.4%), neuropathy peripheral (5.3%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (5.3%). A total of 39 (41.1%) participants had TEAEs associated with drug withdrawal. Of them, 34 (35.8%) participants had treatment-related AEs associated with drug withdrawal. The most frequently reported AEs were neuropathy peripheral (6.3%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (4.2%) and myalgia (3.2%). A total of 36 (37.9%) participants had TEAEs associated with drug interruption. Of them, 25 (26.3%) participants had treatment-related AEs associated with drug interruption. The most frequently reported AEs were peripheral motor neuropathy (5.3%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (4.2%). Generally, higher percentage of participants had maximum Grade 3-4 TEAEs, treatment-related AEs and drug withdrawal due to AEs reported in PF-06804103 >2.0 mg/kg groups. In Part 1A, a total of 4 participants had DLTs reported. Two participants in the PF-06804103 3.0 mg/kg group had DLTs. One participant had Grade 3 non-serious adverse events (NSAE) of arthralgia and Grade 3 SAE of neuralgia, which were both considered to be treatment-related. One participant had Grade 3 musculoskeletal pain, which was considered to be treatment-related and associated with drug withdrawal. Two participants in the PF-06804103 4.0 mg/kg group had DLTs. One participant had Grade 2 ejection fraction decreased, which was considered to be treatment-related. One participant had Grade 3 AEs of arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue, which were all considered to be treatment-related. One participant with HR+ HER2-Low BC in Part 2A receiving PF-06804103 3.0 mg/kg died due to non-treatment-related neoplasm progression. This death was within 28 days after last dose of study drug. The participant only received 1 dose of PF-06804103. A total of 38 (40.0%) participants had SAEs reported. Of them, 29 (30.5%) participants had Grade 3-5 SAEs and 19 (20.0%) participants had treatment-related SAEs. The most frequently reported event was intestinal obstruction (6.3%). No other SAEs were reported in more than 2 participants. No trend of clinically significant changes was observed in laboratory results. Eleven (11.6%) participants had pulse rate >120 bpm. Twenty-eight (29.5%) participants had ≥30 mmHg increase from baseline in systolic blood pressure (SBP); 18 (18.9%) participants had ≥30 mmHg decrease from baseline in SBP. Thirty (31.6%) participants had ≥20 mmHg increase from baseline in diastolic blood pressure (DBP); 16 (16.8%) participants had ≥20 mmHg decrease from baseline in DBP. Four (4.3%) participants had QTcF >500 msec reported. All these participants were in Part 2A and diagnosed with HR+ HER2-Low BC. Four (4.3%) participants had PR interval ≥50% change from baseline. Three (3.2%) participants had QRS interval ≥50% change from baseline. Two (2.1%) participants had QTcF ≥60 msec change from baseline. Conclusions: There was a strong trend for dose response relationship to both safety and efficacy for PF-06804103, in general. The 3 mg/kg dose was better tolerated but appeared less efficacious and vice versa for 4 mg/kg seen in both HER2+ BC and HR+ HER2-Low BC. Notable drivers of study treatment discontinuation include skin toxicity, neuropathy, myalgia, and arthralgia. In participants with HER2+ BC, only 1 confirmed responder was observed receiving PF-06804103 3 mg/kg and this participant had the longest DR of 18.9 months; 5 confirmed responders receiving PF-06804103 4 mg/kg had the median DR of 7.0 months (range: 2.4, 18.7). PF-06804103 PK properties were investigated by analyzing 3 analytes including PF-06804103 (ADC, measured as conjugated antibody), total antibody and PF-06380101 (unconjugated payload) following monotherapy (Q3W) and combination therapy (Q2W) IV infusion regimens. The exposure of all 3 analytes increased in a dose dependent manner following single and multiple dosing, and dose accumulation was minimal following repeated dosing. Inter-participant variability of PF-06804103 ADC and total antibody PK parameters were moderate. After the treatment, 16 out of 88 evaluable participants (18.2%) tested positive for ADA; and 4 of them (4.5%) tested positive for NAb. All of the ADA and NAb cases were treatment-induced. In conclusion, PF-06804103 demonstrated overall favorable benefit risk profile in treating patients with HER2-expressing solid tumor and has the potential to be successfully developed as monotherapy or in combination including with checkpoint inhibitors in the right clinical setting and applying data-driven dosing strategies. Pfizer management had decided to terminate this asset for business reasons in part due to the competition in this space.
