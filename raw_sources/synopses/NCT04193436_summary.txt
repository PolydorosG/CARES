Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Samples collected for the measurement of PF-06835919 PK were analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with applicable standard operating procedures (SOPs). The PK parameters were calculated for each participant for PF-06835919, as applicable, using noncompartmental analysis (NCA) of concentration-time data. Samples below the lower limit of quantitation were set to 0 μg/mL for the PK analysis. Actual sample collection times were used for the pharmacokinetic analysis. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included physical examinations, vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure), 12-lead ECGs, adverse events (AEs), pregnancy testing and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Individual PF-06835919 concentrations were listed and summarized descriptively by nominal PK sampling time and hepatic function cohort. Individual participant and summary profiles of the concentration-time data were plotted by hepatic function cohort for both total plasma PF-06835919 and unbound PF-06835919. Unbound fractions (F ) were listed and u summarized descriptively by hepatic function cohort. PF-06835919 AUC , area under the inf plasma concentration time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC ), C , AUC , unbound AUC (AUC ), and unbound C last max inf,u last last,u max (C ) individual participant parameters were plotted by hepatic function cohort. PK max,u parameters of PF-06835919 were summarized descriptively by hepatic function cohort. AEs were reported in accordance with the sponsor reporting standards by hepatic function group. Laboratory data were listed and summarized in accordance with the sponsor reporting standards. Vital signs and ECG data were summarized by hepatic function group and visit using sponsor reporting standards. Vital sign and ECG values meeting the criteria of potential clinical concern were planned to be listed. In addition, listings of participants with any single RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 34 participants were screened, of whom 11 had screen failure and 23 entered the study. There were 6, 6, 6 and 5 participants in the without hepatic impairment group, mild hepatic impairment group, moderate hepatic impairment group and severe hepatic impairment group, respectively. All of the 23 treated participants received their assigned treatment, and no participant discontinued. All participants in the study were white. There were more male than female participants and the median (range) age of the participants was 65 (38-73) years. Except for gender, height and weight, the demographic and other baseline characteristics were generally balanced across the 4 cohorts. A summary of the demographic and other baseline characteristics is provided in Table S3. Efficacy Results: There were no efficacy evaluations in this study. Pharmacokinetic Results: Note: when the PK parameters and PK concentration of PF-06835919 is referred without the word “unbound”, they are the total PK parameters and concentrations. Plasma PF-06835919 exposure based on AUC increased slightly in participants with inf moderate and severe hepatic impairment (18930 ng.hr/mL and 19630 ng.hr/mL respectively), the AUC in participants with mild hepatic impairment was similar to those with normal inf hepatic function (14090 ng.hr/mL and 13090 ng.hr/mL for participants with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment, respectively). C was generally similar between max participants with normal hepatic function and those with hepatic impairment (1310 ng/mL, 1143 ng/mL, 1340 ng/mL and 1098 ng/mL for participants with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment, moderate hepatic impairment and severe hepatic impairment, respectively). Adjusted geometric mean Test/Reference ratios and 90% CI for AUCinf comparing the varying degrees of hepatic impairment (Test) to normal hepatic function (Reference) were 92.89% (68.15%, 126.60%) for participants with mild hepatic impairment, 134.40% (98.61%, 183.17%) for participants with moderate hepatic impairment, and geometric mean Test/Reference ratios and 90% CI for C were 87.20% (63.61%, 119.53%) max for participants with mild hepatic impairment, 102.24% (74.59%, 140.15%) for participants with moderate hepatic impairment, and 83.78% (60.18%, 116.62%) for participants with severe hepatic impairment. Plasma unbound PF-06835919 exposure based on AUC increased in participants with inf,u moderate and severe hepatic impairment (1093 ng.hr/mL and 1119 ng.hr/mL respectively), AUC was similar between participants with normal hepatic function and those with mild inf,u hepatic impairment (612.6 ng.hr/mL and 746.2 ng.hr/mL for participants with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment, respectively). C was similar between participants max,u with normal hepatic function and those with mild and severe hepatic impairment, and slightly higher in participants with moderate hepatic function (56.93 ng/mL, 65.16 ng/mL, 77.45 ng/mL and 67.10 ng/mL for participants with normal hepatic function, mild hepatic impairment, moderate hepatic impairment and severe hepatic impairment, respectively). Adjusted geometric mean Test/Reference ratios and 90% CI for AUC were 121.81% inf,u (88.69%, 167.31%) for participants with mild hepatic impairment, 178.50% (129.96%, 245.18%) for participants with moderate hepatic impairment, and 195.73% (140.31%, 273.03%) for participants with severe hepatic impairment. Adjusted geometric mean Test/Reference ratios and 90% CI for C were 114.45% (88.13%, 148.63%) for max,u participants with mild hepatic impairment, 136.04% (104.75%, 176.67%) for participants with moderate hepatic impairment, and 117.87% (89.61%, 155.03%) for participants with severe hepatic impairment. PF-06835919 is moderately to highly bound to plasma proteins, with <10% of drug unbound in plasma. A slight increase in F was observed as hepatic function decreased, with a mean F u u value of 0.04345 in participants with normal hepatic function, 0.05704 in participants with mild hepatic function, 0.05780 in participants with moderate hepatic impairment and 0.06111 in participants with severe hepatic impairment. Safety Results: A total of 5 AEs were reported for 2 participants: 4 AEs for 1 participant in the moderate hepatic impairment group and 1 AE for 1 participant in the severe hepatic impairment group. Of the AEs which were reported for the 1 participant in the moderate hepatic impairment group, 2 were considered treatment-related. There were no SAEs, severe AEs, discontinuations from study or treatment due to AEs, dose reductions or temporary discontinuations due to AEs. There were no clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities. There were no clinically significant vital signs or ECG data. Conclusion(s):  Following a single oral dose, plasma exposure for PF-06835919 based on AUC was inf similar between the normal hepatic function group and the mild hepatic impairment group. Slightly higher AUC values were observed in the moderate and severe hepatic inf hepatic function group. Similar C values were observed between participants with max normal hepatic function and those with hepatic impairment.  Unbound plasma exposure for PF-06835919 based on AUC was similar between the inf,u normal hepatic function group and the mild hepatic impairment group. Higher AUCinf,u values were observed in the moderate and severe hepatic impairment groups with a 79% and 96% increase, respectively, compared to the normal hepatic function group. Similar results were observed for C values in participants with normal hepatic function and max,u those with mild and severe hepatic impairment, but participants with moderate hepatic function had a slightly higher C (36% increase). max,u  A slight increase in plasma F was observed as hepatic function decreased with a mean F u u value of 0.04345 in participants with normal hepatic function to 0.06111 in participants with severe hepatic impairment.  PF-06835919 is generally safe and well-tolerated in adult participants with normal hepatic function or varying degrees of hepatic impairment.
