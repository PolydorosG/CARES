COMPOUND NUMBER PF-06700841 PROTOCOL NO.: B7931004 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Phase 2a, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of PF-06700841 in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Study Centers: This is a multicenter study conducted at 35 centers in 3 countries (8 in Canada, 5 in Poland and 22 in United States); 1 center in United States was initiated and patients were screened but not randomized. Hence, this center was terminated early. Study Initiation Date and Primary Completion or Final Completion Dates: First Subject First Visit (FSFV): 01 December 2016; Last Subject Last Visit (LSLV): 19 March 2018 Phase of Development: Phase 2a Study Objectives: Primary Objective:  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06700841 in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Secondary Objectives:  To explore the efficacy of PF-06700841 induction and maintenance dosing regimens in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  To assess the safety and tolerability of PF-06700841 induction and maintenance dosing regimens. METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The first part of double-blind daily treatment. At the end of Week 4, all subjects switched to their predefined double-blind maintenance treatment regimen for Week 5 through Week 12. Approximately 200 subjects were planned to be randomized into the study, to allow for approximately 160 evaluable subjects (20 completers per arm). The randomization ratio was 7:1, active: placebo. During the first 4 weeks of the treatment period, subjects received 1 of the 3 treatments orally, either 30 mg once daily (QD) or 60 mg QD of PF-06700841, or matching placebo. During the 8-week maintenance portion of the treatment period (Weeks 5 through 12), subjects received 1 of the 4 treatments, either PF-06700841 10 mg, or 30 mg QD, or a 100 mg once weekly (QW) regimen of PF-06700841, or matching placebo. Maintenance dose level and regimen were assigned at the initial time of randomization into the study. All subjects, regardless of assigned regimen (ie, QD or QW) received blinded QD tablets throughout the study treatment period to maintain the study blind. The duration of study subject participation was approximately 26 weeks, including screening (up to 6 weeks), 12-week treatment period, and 8-week follow-up period. Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): Approximately 200 subjects were planned to be randomized into the study. A total of 212 subjects were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study treatment and analyzed during the study. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Inclusion Criteria: Subjects were males and females with a diagnosis of plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months prior to first study dose, aged 18 to 75 years, inclusive. Subjects must also have had a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 12 or greater, a Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) score of 3 (“moderate”) or 4 (“severe”), and plaque-type psoriasis covering at least 10% of total body surface area (BSA) prior to first study dose. Subjects were willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures. Exclusion Criteria: Subjects who had non-plaque forms of psoriasis (eg, erythrodermic, guttate, or pustular psoriasis), evidence of skin conditions (eg, eczema), or current drug-induced psoriasis, eg, a new onset of psoriasis or an exacerbation of psoriasis from beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antimalariala drugs or lithium, were excluded from the study. Fertile male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential who were unwilling or unable to use 2 highly effective method of contraception for the duration of the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product, were excluded from the study. Subjects who had evidence or history of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematological, gastrointestinal, metabolic, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or neurological disease were not eligible in the study. Study Treatment: Blinded PF-06700841 and matching placebo were provided as tablets for oral administration. orally for 12 weeks from study Days 1 to 85 during the trial; subjects swallowed the tablets with ambient temperature water to a total volume of approximately 240 mL; subjects swallowed the investigational product whole, and did not manipulate or chew the medication prior to swallowing. Investigational product could be taken with or without food; however, for all study visits during the treatment period, subjects were instructed to refrain from dosing at home, and took the dose in the clinic from their previous blister card and dose from the newly dispensed blister card on the next day at home. Efficacy Endpoints: Primary Endpoint:  Change from baseline in PASI score at Week 12. Key Secondary Endpoint:  Proportion of subjects achieving a 75% reduction from baseline in the PASI total score (PASI75) response at Week 12. Other Secondary Endpoints:  Proportion of subjects achieving 50%, 75% and 90% reduction from baseline PASI.  Change from baseline in PASI scores.  Percent change from baseline in PASI scores.  Change from baseline in PASI score at Week 4. Safety Evaluations: Standard safety assessments included clinical monitoring such as adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis), and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical Methods: Efficacy Analysis: The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in PASI score at Week 12. The primary analysis data were based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. Baseline was defined as the score for each assessment on Day 1 pre-dose. The analyses for continuous secondary endpoints were based on the FAS. Baseline was defined as the score for each assessment on Day 1 pre-dose. These endpoints included:  Change from baseline in PASI score at Week 4. All continuous secondary endpoints including all time points were analyzed using MMRM with Observed Cases (OC). Least square (LS) means at each time point were computed. P-values and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were also computed for placebo adjusted effect (LS mean difference between treatment and placebo) at each time point. Unless otherwise stated, all primary analyses for the binary secondary endpoints were based on the FAS. Baseline was defined as the score for each assessment on Day 1 pre-dose. These endpoints included: Key secondary endpoint:  Proportion of subjects achieving PASI75 response at Week 12. Secondary endpoint:  Proportion of subjects achieving 50%, 75% and 90% reduction from baseline PASI. Marginal logistic regression was employed on FAS with OC. Additional analysis was performed by logistic regression at each time point with non-responder imputation (NRI). In the case of convergence issues of the marginal logistic regression, logistic regression analysis with NRI was applied. Safety Analysis: Safety endpoints included:  Incidence and severity of AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs) and withdrawals due to AEs.  Change from baseline in clinical laboratory values (chemistry and hematology, lipids).  Change from baseline in vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse rate, oral or tympanic temperature measurements).  Change from baseline in ECG parameters (heart rate, QT interval, corrected QT interval, PR interval, and QRS interval). All subjects who receive study medication were included in the safety analyses. Safety and tolerability were assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs and laboratory tests. All the tables, listings and graphs for AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECGs followed the sponsor’s standards. were used when needed to compare incidence rate of safety strata between active groups and placebo, 95% CIs were formed for tier-2 events. The exposure adjusted summaries for tier-2 events were also conducted. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition and evaluation groups are summarized in Table 1. Of 328 subjects screened for entry into the study, 212 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study treatment. All treated subjects were analyzed for efficacy and safety. For the rest of the document, the 7 PF-06700841 treatment groups will be referred to as follows in text and tables:  PF-06700841 60 mg QD to 30 mg QD group or “the 60 to 30 mg QD group”.  PF-06700841 60 mg QD to 10 mg QD group or “the 60 to 10 mg QD group”.  PF-06700841 60 mg QD to 100 mg QW group or “the 60 mg QD to 100 mg QW group”.  PF-06700841 60 mg QD to placebo group or “the 60 mg QD to placebo group”.  PF-06700841 30 mg QD group or “the 30 mg QD group”.  PF-06700841 30 mg QD to 10 mg QD group or “the 30 to 10 mg QD group”.  PF-06700841 30 mg QD to 100 mg QW group or “the 30 mg QD to 100 mg QW group”. Overall, 164 of 212 (77.4%) subjects completed the study. The 30 mg QD group had the most subjects (27, 93.1%) who completed the study. A total of 48 subjects discontinued across all 3 disposition phases: 15 (7.1%) subjects from the induction period, 27 (12.7%) subjects from the maintenance period and 6 (2.8%) subjects from the follow-up period. A total of 5 (2.4%) subjects, 6 (2.8%) subjects and 1 (0.5%) subject, respectively, discontinued from the induction, maintenance and follow-up period due to AEs. In general, the proportions of subjects who discontinued due to AEs in each period were similar for all treatment groups. One (0.5%) subject and 4 (1.9%) subjects, respectively, discontinued from the induction and maintenance period due to lack of efficacy. The majority of the treated subjects were male (69.8%) and white (89.2%). The mean age was 46.0 years (median: 48.0, range: 18 to 75). The mean weight was 94.7 kg (median: 91.6, range: 45.1 to 204.3), and mean body mass index (BMI) was 31.9 kg/m2 (median: 30.9, range: 18.9 to 64.7). The mean duration of psoriasis since first diagnosis was 17.9 years, with a mean baseline PASI score of 20.8, which was comparable for subjects in all treatment groups. Table 1.

Other Secondary Endpoints: Proportion of Subjects Achieving 50%, 75% And 90% Reduction from Baseline PASI: PASI75: Overall, greater proportions of subjects achieving PASI75 responses were observed since Week 4 for all the active treatment groups during the 12-week treatment period, compared to the placebo group. The greatest proportion of subjects achieving a PASI75 response was observed in the 30 mg QD group at Week 12 (86.2%), followed by the 60 to 30 mg QD group (60.0%) and the 60 mg QD to 100 mg QW group (57.7%). The proportion of subjects achieving a PASI75 response in the 30 mg QD increased consistently throughout the 12-week treatment period. PASI50: Overall, greater proportions of subjects achieving PASI50 responses were observed for all the active treatment groups during the 12-week treatment period, compared to the QW group (69.2%) and the 60 to 30 mg QD group (68.0%). The proportion of subjects achieving a PASI50 response in the 30 mg QD increased consistently throughout the 12-week treatment period. PASI90: Overall, greater proportions of subjects achieving PASI90 responses were observed since Week 4 for all the active treatment groups during the 12-week treatment period, compared to the placebo group. The greatest proportion of subjects achieving a PASI90 response was observed in the 30 mg QD group at Week 12 (51.7%), followed by the 60 to 30 mg QD group (36.0%) and the 60 mg QD to 100 mg QW group (26.9%). The proportion of subjects achieving a PASI90 response in the 30 mg QD and 60 to 30 mg QD groups increased consistently throughout the 12-week treatment period. Change from Baseline in PASI Score at Week 4: Decreases from baseline in PASI score at Week 4 were observed in both 60 mg QD and 30 mg QD induction dose group. The placebo adjusted decrease from baseline in PASI score at Week 4 observed in the 60 mg QD induction dose group (LS mean difference: -9.00, 90% CI: -11.43, -6.57) was numerically higher than in the 30 mg QD induction dose group (LS mean difference: -7.99, 90% CI: -10.48, -5.51). Change From Baseline in PASI Scores: Overall, greater decreases from baseline in PASI scores were observed for all the active treatment groups during the 12-week treatment period, compared to the placebo group. The greatest decrease from baseline in PASI score was observed in the 30 mg QD group at Week 12. Percent Change from Baseline in PASI Scores: Similar results as change from baseline in PASI scores are presented in the descriptive statistics of the percent change from baseline in PASI scores and the LS mean of percent change from baseline in PASI scores. Safety Results: Subjects discontinued from study due to AEs are summarized in Table 1. All-causality and treatment-related treatment emergent SAEs are summarized in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. All-causality treatment emergent non-SAEs occurring in >5% of subjects are summarized in Table 7. One post-therapy death occurred due to gunshot wound after the subject was discontinued from the study due to noncompliance with study drug, which was considered unrelated to the study treatment by the investigator. Five subjects experienced a total of 6 SAEs during the study; 3 of the SAEs were considered to be related to study drug by the investigator, of which 2 SAEs (pneumonia and sepsis) reported by 1 subject in the 60 mg QD to 100 mg QW group were considered not related to 2 SAEs of pneumonia and sepsis on Day 2 before dosing and was permanently discontinued from study due to the SAE of pneumonia. One subject in the 30 to 10 mg QD group was found to have a positive urine human chorionic gonadotropin test at the Week 6 (Day 42) visit after which confirmation with serum pregnancy test led to permanent discontinuation from study on Day 53. On Day 165, an obstetrical ultrasound demonstrated a right-sided cleft lip with a gap of 10 millimeters in the fetus, with no definite cleft palate. The Day 176 obstetrical ultrasound confirmed presence of cleft lip in the fetus, with all other findings appearing within normal limits. This event of fetal cleft lip was unexpected in the single reference safety document for the study drug and was assessed as related per sponsor. No subject experienced herpes zoster during the study. Six subjects experienced AEs of herpes simplex; 5 were mild in severity and 1 was a moderate AE of herpes simplex reported by 1 subject in the 60 mg QD to 100 mg QW group during the induction period. One subject in the 30 mg QD to 100 mg QW group was reported to have an AE of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin on Day 2. The AE was mild and not related to the study drug as evaluated by the investigator, and resolved on Day 57. Serious infections (pneumonia and sepsis) were reported for 1 subject in the 60 mg QD to 100 mg QW group. The subject only had 1 dose of PF-06700841 60 mg on Day 1 and the serious infections (pneumonia and sepsis) occurred on Day 2 before dosing. There were no clinically meaningful observable dose dependent neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia among the active treatment groups, except for 1 SAE of anemia reported by 1 subject in the 60 to 10 mg QD group. The same subject had pre-existing kidney dysfunction (chronic kidney disease stage 3), and increased serum creatinine and serum Cystatin-C values (1.3 mg/dL [reference range: 0.4 to 1.2 mg/dL], 1.72 mg/L [reference range: 0.53 to 0.95 mg/L], respectively) at screening. During the study, the subject developed a moderate AE of acute kidney dysfunction and concomitant 30% decreases from baseline in serum creatinine (SCr) based and serum Cystatin-C (S Cystatin-C) based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which were considered as individual clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. No subjects met the laboratory test discontinuation criteria (laboratory test abnormalities confirmed through re-testing within 48 hours) during study treatment. There was no potential Hy’s Law case reported during the study. There were no clinical meaningful findings in vital signs, ECG, and suicidal behavior or ideation during the study. Table 5.

Greater response rates for PASI75 and PASI90 were observed since Week 4 for all the active treatment groups during the 12-week treatment period compared to the placebo group. The greatest response in PASI50 and PASI90 was observed in the 30 mg QD group at Week 12. Greater decreases from baseline in PASI score at Week 4 were observed in both 60 mg QD and 30 mg QD induction dose groups compared to placebo. The change from baseline in PASI score at Week 4 was numerically higher in the 60 mg QD induction dose group than in the 30 mg QD induction dose group.  PF-06700841 administered as an induction regimen in daily doses up to 60 mg for 4 weeks and a maintenance regimen in daily dose of 10 mg and weekly dose of 100 mg for 8 weeks, or as a chronic dosing for 12 weeks in daily dose of 30 mg was safe and well tolerated in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.  During the induction period, dose-dependent decreases from baseline were observed in reticulocytes and neutrophils.  During the induction period, increases from baseline were observed in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK). There was no potential Hy’s Law case reported during the study.  During the induction period, increases from baseline in SCr were observed in all the active treatment groups compared to the placebo group. Increased SCr levels persisted during the maintenance period in the 60 to 30 mg QD, 60 to 10 mg QD, and 30 mg QD groups. No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed in the S Cystatin-C levels across treatment groups. SCr based eGFR 30% reductions from baseline were observed in 20 subjects, but only 1 subject with pre-existing kidney dysfunction had concomitant 30% decreases from baseline in SCr- based and S Cystatin-C based eGFR during the study treatment period.  During the induction period, dose-dependent increases from baseline were observed in low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), and total cholesterol. There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline observed in LDL/HDL ratio and triglycerides across treatment groups during the study. behavior or ideation during the study.
