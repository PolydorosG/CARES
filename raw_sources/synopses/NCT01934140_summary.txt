Source: Protocol MenACWY-TT-099 (C0921002) Protocol Amendment 1, 29Feb2016. METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 3b, open-label, active controlled and uncontrolled study with 2 parallel groups. At Visit 5 (Month 120 after primary vaccination), 1 dose of Meningococcal Polysaccharide Groups A, C, W-135, and Y Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine (MenACWY-TT) was administered to the participants in both study groups. This study is an extension of the following studies: 107386 (MenACWY-TT-015), 107392 (016 EXT:015 Y1), 107398 (017 EXT:015 Y2), 107402 (018 EXT:015 Y3), 107404 (019 EXT:015 Y4), 107406 (020 EXT:015 Y5). The duration of this study is listed below for the persistence phase and booster phase. Persistence Phase  Epoch 001: Persistence Visit 1 (Month 72 [Year 6] post primary vaccination)  Epoch 002: Persistence Visit 2 (Month 84 [Year 7] post primary vaccination)  Epoch 003: Persistence Visit 3 (Month 96 [Year 8] post primary vaccination)  Epoch 004: Persistence Visit 4 (Month 108 [Year 9] post primary vaccination)  Epoch 005: Persistence Visit 5 (Month 126 [Year 10] post primary vaccination) Booster Phase  Epoch 005: Booster starting at Visit 5 (Month 120 [Year 10] after primary vaccination) and ending at the phone contact visit (Month 126 or 6 months after booster vaccination) There were 2 parallel groups in this study. The study groups are listed below:  ACWY-TT group: all participants vaccinated with MenACWY-TT in Study MenACWY-TT-015 (107386)  MenPS group: all participants vaccinated with Mencevax ACWY in Study MenACWY-TT-015 (107386) Four hundred (400) subjects (299 in the ACWY-TT group and 101 in the MenPS group) were enrolled and vaccinated in Study MenACWY-TT-015 (107386) in the Philippines. The subjects who completed the vaccination phase of Study MenACWY-TT-015 (107386) and received either MenACWY-TT or Mencevax ACWY were eligible for this study if they met the inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria. Participants were followed up for 5 years after vaccination. The subjects were allowed to return at any visit during the persistence epochs. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate antibody persistence 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years after primary vaccination with MenACWY-TT as compared to Mencevax ACWY when given to healthy participants 11 to 55 years of age. In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT administered to all eligible participants 10 years after the primary vaccination was evaluated. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: All subjects must have satisfied the following criteria at study entry to the persistence phase:  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, complied with the requirements of the protocol (eg, completion of the diary cards, returned for follow-up visits) and/or subjects’ parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) (LAR[s]) who, in the opinion of the investigator, complied with the requirements of the protocol (eg, completion of the diary cards, returned for follow-up visits).  A male or female between and including 17 and 66 years of age at the time of entry into the present study.  Completed the vaccination phase of the vaccination Study MenACWY-TT-015 (107386) (ie, not withdrawn, had received 1 dose of study vaccine).  In alignment with local laws and regulations, written informed consent obtained from parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject and written informed assent obtained from the subject if the subject was less than 18 years of age, or written informed consent obtained from the subject if the subject achieved the 18th birthday. The subjects 18 years of age at the time of enrollment signed the ICF, even if the parent/LAR previously signed the ICF before the subject reached the legal age of consent.  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and history-directed physical examination before entering into the study. All subjects must have satisfied the following additional criteria prior to entry of the booster phase:  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may have been enrolled in the study.  Non-childbearing potential was defined as pre-menarche, hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy, or postmenopause.  Male subjects able to father children and female subjects of childbearing potential (including female subjects who had tubal ligation) and at risk for pregnancy may have been enrolled in the study, if the subject:  had practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and  had a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination (for females only), and  agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination. The following exclusion criteria were checked at the time of study entry. If any exclusion criterion applied, the subject was not included in the study:  Child in care.  Previous vaccination with meningococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine outside of Study MenACWY-TT-015 (107386).  History of meningococcal disease due to serogroup A, C, W-135, or Y.  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition (congenital or secondary), including human immunodeficiency virus infection, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.  History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse. Additional exclusion criteria for booster phase at Month 120 study entry (checked at Month 120) for all subjects:  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the booster dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the follow-up period.  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the booster vaccine dose (for corticosteroids, this meant prednisone 10 mg/day, or equivalent). Inhaled, topical and intra-articular steroids were allowed.  Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the booster dose of study vaccine or planned administration within 30 days after vaccination (with the day of vaccination considered Day 0), with the exception of a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine.  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the booster vaccination or planned administration during the follow-up period.  Concurrently participated in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject was exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).  Previous vaccination with tetanus toxoid (TT) within the last month (ie, TT-containing vaccine within the last month).  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines.  History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). History of a simple, single febrile seizure was permitted.  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination.  Fever was defined as temperature 37.5C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or 38.0C for rectal route.

Vaccines Administered: Study vaccine was administered at Visit 5 (Month 120). One (1) dose of study vaccine was administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm. The participants were observed closely for at least 30 minutes following the administration of the vaccine, with appropriate medical treatment readily available in case of anaphylaxis. Immunogenicity Evaluations: A summary of the serological assays performed is presented in Table S2: Table S2. Humoral Immunity (Antibody Determination) Abbreviations: Ab = antibody;IgG = immunoglobulin; rSBA = serum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement. Safety Evaluations: The safety data required to be collected during the study were solicited local events (ie, pain, redness, and swelling at injection site), solicited general events (fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache), unsolicited adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and AEs of special interest. The definitions for solicited and unsolicited AEs were specific to this study and differed from those in the European Union Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices, effective 02 July 2012. Statistical Methods: The persistence Visit 1 (Month 72 [Year 6] after primary vaccination) was not completed in this study; therefore, there are no Month 72 data. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A summary of the disposition of subjects in the persistence phase for the total cohort for Months 84, 96, 108, and 120 is presented in Table S3. A total of 235 subjects were enrolled in the ACWY-TT group and 76 subjects were enrolled in the MenPS group. The mean age at enrollment in the current study was similar in both groups (Table S3). A total of 164 subjects from the ACWY-TT group and 56 subjects from the MenPS group were enrolled in the booster phase to receive MenACWY-TT at Month 121 (Table S4). The mean subject age at booster vaccination was similar in both groups. Nearly all subjects from the booster phase completed the Month 121 visit (159 [97.0%] and 53 [94.6%] in the ACWY-TT and MenPS groups, respectively) and the Month 126 telephone contact (161 [98.2%] and 54 [96.4%] in the ACWY-TT and MenPS groups, respectively).

Immunogenicity Results: In general, vaccine meningococcal antibodies persisted from Months 84 to 120 after primary vaccination with MenACWY-TT or Mencevax ACWY. The percentage of subjects with rSBA titers greater than or equal to the cutoff values (1:8 and 1:128) and geometric mean titers (GMTs) for the adapted ATP cohort remained generally stable across all time points. The persistence of the serum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement (rSBA)- MenA, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY immune response was generally higher for subjects in the ACWY-TT group in comparison to the MenPS group. The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA titers 1:8 ranged from 76.0% to 88.3% in the ACWY-TT group, compared to 1:8 ranged from 82.5% to 90.7% in the ACWY-TT group, compared to 76.9% to 90.2% in the MenPS group. The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenW-135 titers 1:8 ranged from 55.8% to 70.2% in the ACWY-TT group, compared to 9.8% to 24.1% in the MenPS group. The percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenY titers 1:8 ranged from 76.2% to 89.5% in the ACWY-TT group, compared to 40.3% to 64.8% in the MenPS group. The percentage of subjects with rSBA titers 1:128 followed the same trends as the percentage of rSBA titers 1:8 in both groups. The mean GMTs observed for rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY were higher in the ACWY-TT group in comparison to the MenPS group. GMTs for rSBA-MenC were similar for both vaccine groups. GMTs remained generally similar across all time-points in the persistence phase for both vaccine groups. For subjects who received a booster vaccination 10 years after the primary vaccination, a robust booster vaccination response was observed. In both the ACWY-TT and MenPS groups, the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY titers 1:8 increased from 21.1% to 90.9% at Month 120 to 98.1% to 100.0% at Month 121 (1 month after booster vaccination). The GMTs observed in response to booster vaccination were greater in the ACWY-TT group in comparison to the MenPS group, particularly for rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY. No clinically relevant differences were observed in vaccine response between subjects who were initially seronegative before the booster vaccination and those who were initially seropositive before the booster vaccination. Between Month 120 and Month 121 (1 month after booster vaccination), the percentage of subjects with anti-TT concentrations 0.1 IU/mL increased from 86.5% to 99.4% in the ACWY-TT group, and from 61.5% to 98.1% in the MenPS group. Virtually all subjects who were seronegative prior to booster vaccination experienced seroconversion at 1 month after booster vaccination (95.2% and 95.0% of seronegative subjects in the ACWY-TT and MenPS groups, respectively). Safety Results: A similar proportion of subjects in the ACWY-TT group and MenPS group reported at least 1 local or general solicited event during the 4-day postbooster vaccination period (40.9% versus 37.5%, respectively). Grade 3 solicited general events reported within the ACWY-TT group included 1 (0.6%) report of fatigue, 1 (0.6%) report of gastrointestinal event, and 2 (1.3%) reports of headache, all of which were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. No Grade 3 events were reported in the MenPS group. The proportion of subjects reporting at least 1 AE during the 31-day postbooster vaccination period was 9.1% (15 subjects) in the ACWY-TT group and 3.6% (2 subjects) in the MenPS group. Most reported unsolicited AEs were in the system organ class (SOC) of infections and infestations (7 [4.3%] in the ACWY-TT group and 2 [3.6%] in the MenPS group). Three (3) AEs in the ACWY-TT group (1 report each of dizziness, hypoesthesia, and oropharyngeal pain) were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. None of the AEs in the MenPS group were assessed as being related to the investigational vaccine by the investigator. No related Grade 3 AEs were reported during this study. No deaths, SAEs, new-onset of chronic illnesses, or other significant AEs were reported during this study. No SAEs were reported as having occurred between Study MenACWY-TT-015 (107386) and enrollment in the current study. Most solicited local or general events were mild or moderate in severity and none led to study withdrawal. No subjects were withdrawn from the study for safety-related reasons. Conclusions: Antibody persistence at Years 7 to 10 after primary vaccination was higher among subjects primed with MenACWY-TT compared with subjects primed with Mencevax ACWY, as measured by the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-Men-Y titers greater than or equal to predefined cutoff values. Antibody persistence for MenC was similar for both vaccine groups. While a robust MenACWY-TT booster vaccination response was observed in both vaccine groups, greater GMTs were observed in subjects primed with MenACWY-TT compared with subjects primed with Mencevax ACWY at 1 month after booster vaccination. No new safety concerns or adverse reactions for Nimenrix were identified in this long-term persistence study of subjects 11 to 55 years of age who received a primary vaccination of either MenACWY-TT or Mencevax ACWY (Study MenACWY-TT-015 [107386]) and who subsequently received a booster dose of MenACWY-TT 10 years after primary vaccination. Overall, the results of the analysis at 7 to 10 years after primary vaccination and up to 6 months after booster vaccination continue to support a favorable benefit-risk assessment of MenACWY-TT in this age group.
