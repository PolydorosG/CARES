PROPRIETARY DRUG NAME®/GENERIC DRUG NAME: Advil/Ibuprofen 400 mg caplets PROTOCOL NO.: B3491013 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Multicenter Actual Use and Compliance Study of Ibuprofen 400 mg in a Simulated Over-The-Counter Environment Study Center(s): Twenty five (25) centers in the United States took part in this study. One (1) additional center was dedicated for follow-up telephone data collection and adverse event (AE) collection and reporting. Study Initiation Date and Final Completion Dates: Study Initiation Date: 17 November 2014 Final Completion Date: 27 May 2015 Phase of Development: Phase 3 Study Objective(s): The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the behavior of an over-the-counter (OTC)-like population when using ibuprofen 400 mg caplets after deciding to purchase the study medication with respect to their compliance with label directions for use. METHODS Study Design: This was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, 30-day study designed to mimic an OTC-like environment in which subjects used the product after making a purchase decision about ibuprofen 400 mg caplets based only on their reading of the Drug Facts Label (DFL) and other information on the package. Subjects were recruited by advertising that was targeted to individuals who use OTC pain relievers to treat minor aches and pains. Potential subjects were instructed to call a toll free number, upon which they were screened by phone - for initial eligibility criteria. When they reported to the pharmacy site, all potential subjects reviewed the information on the package, made a purchase decision, provided information regarding history of analgesic use, demographic information, and completed the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) test. Subjects who said they would purchase the product were asked to review and sign the informed consent document. Women of childbearing potential were required to take a urine pregnancy test to verify they were not pregnant prior to enrollment. Subjects then purchased study medicine and were provided a + 12 days) to gather information on AEs, concomitant medications for subjects who experienced AEs, subjects’ use of the study medication (and reasons for any important deviations from the label directions), concomitant analgesic use, any discussion the subject may have had with a physician or other healthcare professional about the study medication use, and to clarify any illegible or missing diary entries. Once the final telephone interview was completed, subjects exited the study. The schedule of activities is presented in Table 1. Table 1.

Subjects were questioned to gather information on AEs, concomitant medications for subjects who experienced AEs, subjects’ use of the medication (and reasons for any deviations from the label directions), concomitant analgesic use, any discussion the subject may have had with a physician or other healthcare professional about the study medication use, and to clarify any illegible or missing diary entries. b Day relative to first purchase of study treatment on Day 1. c After the last dose of study medication, female subjects of childbearing potential and at risk of pregnancy self-administered the End-of-Study Pregnancy Test that was provided to them at the Day 1 visit and recorded the test result in the Diary. d These were evaluated programmatically in the EDC system (based on pre-specified automatic edit checks) at the enrollment visit, prior to subject entry into the Use Phase (before medication purchase). e Subjects were allowed to purchase as much study medication as desired at the start of the study (up to 5 packages) after reading and signing the informed consent form. They were also allowed to purchase additional study medication (not to exceed a total of 5 packages) from the research center if needed during the course of the 30-day study. f As needed (determined by subject) from Day 1 to Day 30. g Subjects were reminded 1-4 days before and 1-4 days after Day 30 by phone call, to return the diary and unused medication, along with all used study product packaging, by postal mail using the provided mailing envelope. h At any time during the 30-day study, subjects could contact the Investigator at the study site or call a dedicated 24-hour nurse line to report an AE. During the End-of-Study Telephone Interview, subjects were queried about AEs. entered in the study (ie, purchase the product) to ensure at least 625 subjects would complete the study and be included in the primary endpoint analysis. A total of 1315 subjects made a purchase decision (Enrollment Population). Of these, 738 subjects purchased the study medication (Purchaser Population) and 685 subjects were included in the Actual Use Population (purchased and returned the diary in which they reported use of the study medication on or after the purchase date). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Male or female subjects at least 18 years of age (19 years of age in Alabama) who reported a history of taking OTC analgesics for pain or fever relief. In addition to administrative reasons for exclusion, subjects were ineligible to participate in the study if they had a history of stomach ulcers or bleeding problems or were currently taking a prescription anticoagulant or systemic steroid medication. Study Treatment: Ibuprofen 400 mg caplets (capsule shaped tablets) were supplied in the proposed package for OTC marketing and purchased by qualifying subjects for use during the 30-day study period. Subjects were to use the investigational product based on their understanding of the directions on the DFL. Endpoints: Consumer Behavior Evaluations: Primary Endpoint: Proportion of subjects taking >1200 mg (>3 caplets) on no more than 2 (ie, 0, 1, or 2) use days during the study (where a use day is defined as a calendar day starting at 12:01 AM in which a subject has taken at least one dose of study medication). Secondary Endpoint: Proportion of subjects taking >400 mg (>1 caplet) at a time on no more than 2 (ie, 0, 1, or 2) dosing occasions during the 30-day study period. Safety Evaluations: At any time during the 30-day study, subjects could contact the Investigator at the study site or call the vendor’s 24-hour nurse line to report an AE. During the End-of-Study Telephone Interview, subjects were queried about AEs. The investigator obtained and recorded on the case report form (CRF)/data collection tool (DCT) all observed or volunteered AEs, the severity (mild, moderate, or severe) of the events, and the investigator’s opinion of the relationship to the study treatment. AEs included adverse drug reactions, illnesses with onset during the study, and exacerbation of previous illnesses. For all AEs, the investigator pursued and obtained information adequate to determine both the outcome of the AE and whether it met the criteria for classification as a serious AE. AEs included adverse drug reactions, illnesses with onset during the study, and exacerbation of previous illnesses. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any AE at any dose that in congenital anomaly/birth defect. A SAE or death was reported immediately if it occurred or came to the attention of the investigator at any time during the study through the last follow-up visit or 28 days after the last dose of the study drug, whichever was later. Statistical Methods: The populations of interest are defined as follows: Screening Population: Potential subjects who responded to the recruitment advertising, called the toll-free number, and completed the telephone screening. Enrollment Population: Subjects who upon fulfilling the phone screen interview (and met telephone screening criteria), scheduled a face-to-face interview at the pharmacy site, appeared at their scheduled interview, and made a purchase decision. Purchaser Population: Subjects who purchased at least 1 carton of study medication. Actual Use Population: Subjects who purchased the study medication and recorded the use of study medication in the diary on or after the first purchase date, and returned the diary. Safety Population: Subjects in the actual use population, and any other subject who provided any follow-up information indicating that they used the study product at least once during the study. A summary of the disposition of subjects (including those in the Screening, Enrollment, Purchaser, Actual Use, and Safety populations) and reasons for exclusion from these populations were provided. The primary and secondary endpoints were analyzed as follows: A subject is considered to have met the primary criterion (correct use) if the total number of days in which a subject took more than 3 caplets is 0, 1, or 2, based on their diary. Acceptable use is defined as exceeding the daily dosing directions, under the advice of a healthcare professional, based on information from the End-of-Study Follow-up Interview. The endpoint is summarized according to the percentage of subjects with correct use, acceptable use, and correct or acceptable use (primary outcome). The objective is considered met for this endpoint if the lower-bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the percentage of subjects meeting the correct or acceptable use criterion is 85% or higher. As supplementary information relating to the primary endpoint, the total number of dosing days a subject exceeded >1200 mg/use day is summarized. The corresponding frequency distribution (ie, number of subjects exceeding this limit on 0 days, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, etc) is provided. This information is also summarized for subjects with correct use, acceptable use, and correct or acceptable use. A subject is considered to have met the secondary criterion if the total number of dosing occasions (distinct usage date/time values from their diary) in which a subject takes 2 or more caplets is 0, 1, or 2 (correct use). The summary statistics including 95% (2-sided) CIs acceptable use. The supplementary information relating to the secondary endpoint, the total number of dosing occasions a subject exceeded >400 mg/dose is summarized. The corresponding frequency distribution (ie, number of subjects exceeding this limit on 0 occasions, 1 occasion, 2 occasions, 3 occasions, etc) is provided. This information is also summarized for the percentage of subjects with correct use, acceptable use, and correct or acceptable use. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 2796 subjects completed the pre-trial questionnaire (Screening Population), 2080 (74.4% of 2796) were referred to a participating retail pharmacy research site for a face-to-face interview after qualifying at the pre-enrollment screening, and 1315 (47.0% of 2796) made a purchase decision (Enrollment Population). Of these, 738 subjects (56.1% of 1315) purchased the study medication (Purchaser Population). A total of 685 subjects (92.8% of 738 who purchased) were included in the Actual Use Population (purchased, and returned the diary in which they reported use of the study medication on or after the purchase date). In addition to the 685 subjects in the Actual Use Population who reported their use of the study medication, 51 additional subjects indicated using the study product (either in the diary or in the End-of-Study Telephone Interview) without providing any detailed dosing information. Therefore, 736 subjects (99.7% of 738 who purchased) were included in the Safety Population. See Table 2. Table 2. Subject Disposition Number of Subjects Screening Population (Completed Pre-Trial Questionnaire) 2796 Qualified for Pre-enrollment Screening 2080 Enrollment Population (Qualified and Presented at Pharmacy Site, and Made Purchase Decision) 1315 Purchaser Population 738 Actual Use Population 685 Safety Population 736 The Actual Use Population consisted of 43.5% men and 56.5% women, with the majority being White (69.8%) or Black/African American (23.4%), and 8.2% who identified themselves as having Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The average age was 54.0 years (standard deviation [SD] = 13.5, range: 19 to 87 years). The majority had a high school certificate (22.6%), some college or technical school (39.4%), or were college graduates (23.9%) or had a postgraduate degree (8.9%), while the remainder (5.1%) had less than a high school certificate. For reading ability, 18.5% of subjects were classified as low-literacy (REALM score ≤60). Within the Actual Use Population, 35.9% of subjects were heavy analgesic users, defined as taking 30 or more doses of an OTC analgesic per month over 3 months prior to enrolling in the study. Demographics were similar across the enrollment, purchaser, actual use, and safety populations (see Table 3).

CONCLUSION(S): The following key consumer use behaviors were observed:  The vast majority of subjects 95.2% (95% CI: 93.6%, 96.8%) either never exceeded the labeled 1200 mg per day maximum or did so on only 2 or fewer days during the study (or alternatively under advice from a health care provider [HCP]), suggesting that the level of misuse observed in this study would be expected to generate minimal excess risk of events with clinical importance, such as GI bleeding. Thus, the Primary Endpoint for the study met the pre-specified success criterion (lower bound of the 95% CI was >85%).  Subjects were somewhat more likely to violate the 1-caplet-per-dose direction (Secondary Endpoint) than the 3-caplet-per-day direction (Primary Endpoint). Within the Actual Use Population, 84.4% (95% CI: 81.7%, 87.1%) exceeded the labeled 400 mg per dose maximum on 2 or fewer occasions (or alternatively under advice from a HCP), and thus were considered correct or acceptable for the Secondary Endpoint.  Across all subjects, the average daily dose was the equivalent of 1.6 caplets per day.  The AEs reported in this actual use trial appear consistent with those reported in previous clinical trials and in spontaneous reporting systems. Most of the events were mild and unrelated to exposure to the study drug. Only 1 of the SAEs was judged related to the investigational product. Overall, results from the study support the conclusion that subjects generally used the medication according to the key directions on the DFL and other package materials. Misuse was mostly limited and, with the exception of a small number of subjects taking significantly more than the labeled daily maximum, would be expected to result in minimal excess risk of events with clinical importance.
