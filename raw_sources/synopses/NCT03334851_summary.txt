SYNOPSIS Study Title: A Phase 1, Randomized, Multi-Center, Double-Blind, Sponsor Open, Placebo- Controlled, Single and Multiple Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of PF-06835375 in Subjects With Seropositive Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or Rheumatoid Arthritis Study Number: C1131001 Regulatory Agency or Public Disclosure Identifier Number: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03334851 EudraCT Number: 2017-003077-34 Study Phase: Phase 1 Name of Study Intervention: C1131001 Name of Sponsor/Company: Pfizer Inc. CSR Version and Report Date: Version 1.0, 16 November 2022 Number of Study Center(s) and Investigator(s): A total of 74 participants were enrolled at 11 centers in the United States (US). A list of study centers and investigators involved in this study is provided in Appendix 16.1.4.1. Publications: Not Applicable (NA). Study Period: Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 17 November 2017 Study Completion (Last Participant Last Visit) Date: 15 February 2022 This study was neither discontinued nor interrupted. Rationale: PF-06835375 is a humanized, selective antibody directed against the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) receptor that has two distinct mechanisms of action: (1) depletion of CXCR5-positive cells through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and (2) antagonism of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 13 (CXCL13)-dependent signaling. By utilizing an antibody that is also antagonistic, cells that escape killing may still be inhibited from trafficking to and participating in germinal center (GC) immune responses. As such, the working hypothesis is that by targeting CXCR5 through a combination of depletion and antagonism, PF-06835375 will effectively impair autoreactive GC reactions, including humoral memory responses, thereby suppressing autoantibody maturation and production known to, in part, underlie autoimmune disease pathology. PF-06835375 is currently in development for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, there is potential utility for targeting CXCR5 for the treatment of systemic autoimmune diseases more broadly. Therefore, other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), remain under consideration given their shared underlying pathophysiology of aberrant humoral immune responses involving B cells and follicular T helper (Tfh) cells. The goal of this first in human (FIH) study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of PF-06835375. In particular, PD characterization included assessment of magnitude and duration of CXCR5-positive cell depletion and recovery. Inhibition of the humoral immune responses via PF-06835375-mediated depletion of CXCR5-positive cells offered the potential for clinical evaluation in a population of seropositive autoimmune participants. Consequently, a mixed population of seropositive SLE or RA participants were enrolled into this study.

Cohorts in Part A were initiated sequentially. Participants in Part B received two doses of study intervention, the first dose on Day 1 and second dose on Day 29. They were enrolled concurrently with Part A following the completion of the initial cohorts in Part A. Participants who were randomized in Part A were not eligible to participate in Part B of this study. In the actual study conduct, 6 SAD cohorts (PF-06835375 0.03 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg and 6 mg IV) and 5 MAD cohorts (PF-06835375 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, and 10 mg SC) were included in Part A and Part B, respectively. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): This study was planned to enroll up to a total of approximately 112 participants at approximately 10 sites. A total of 74 participants were randomized and 73 of them were treated in the study. All participants (73) treated with study intervention were included in the safety and PD analyses. For Parts A and B, all participants with evaluable PK were included in the PK analyses. One participant receiving PF-06835375 6 mg IV in SAD had quantifiable pre-dose PF-06835375 concentrations with the pre-dose concentration level 5% of C . Therefore, the PK data max from this participant was excluded from all summary tables and figures. One participant receiving PF-06835375 10 mg SC in MAD on Day 1 had incomplete PK sampling. Therefore, the PK parameters could not be adequately estimated and serum concentration For participants with majority of PK samples below the LLOQ, eg. 3 quantifiable concentrations, PK parameters were not calculated for:  3 participants for SAD Day 1 PK which included samples from Day 1 to Day 141 for Day 1 PK estimates;  7 participants for MAD Day 1 PK which included samples on Day 1, 2, 4, 8 and 15 for Day 1 PK estimates; 9 participants for MAD Day 29 PK which included samples on Day 29, 36, 43, 57, 85 and 113 for Day 29 PK estimates. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: SLE and RA participants were enrolled into this study. Minimum disease activity (ie, SLEDAI-2K, or DAS28) cutoffs was not required for entry as inclusion criteria. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): The study intervention was PF-06835375 or placebo. PF-06835375 50 mg/mL injection and its placebo were presented as a sterile solution for SC and IV administration. Tetanus/diphtheria (Td) and Meningococcal B (MenB) vaccines were administered to assess the functional effects of PF-06835375 as exploratory objectives. Study intervention information is provided in Table S2. Td vaccines were sourced by the study sites and reimbursed by the sponsor through the contractual agreement with the study institution unless local regulations or other limitation require direct provision of Td vaccine by the sponsor.

All participants in both Part A and B were followed for a minimum of 16 weeks prior to being able to qualify for study completion based on the cellular recovery. In Part A (SAD), participants received single dose of study intervention (placebo and PF-06835375 0.03 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg) IV on Day 1. The total IV infusion time was 120 minutes 10 minutes, unless a different time was needed to manage symptoms typical of infusion reactions. In such a case, the entire duration of study intervention infusion should not have exceeded 4 hours unless a different time was communicated to the site by the sponsor. In Part B (MAD), participants received two doses of study intervention (placebo and PF-06835375 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, 10 mg) SC, with first dose on Day 1 and the repeated dose on Day 29. Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: In Part A (SAD), the majority of participants were female (29 [93.5%]), White (19 [61.3%]), and not Hispanic or Latino (27 [87.1%]). The median (range) age was 52.0 (28, 68) years. In Part B (MAD), the majority of participants were female (36 [85.7%]), White (35 [83.3%]), and not Hispanic or Latino (36 [85.7%]). The median (range) age was 56.5 (22,70) years. There were 34 participants diagnosed of RA and the mean (SD) duration since onset was 14.1 (10.56) years. A total of 39 participants were diagnosed of SLE and the mean (SD) duration since onset was 10.0 (10.95) years. Exposure: In Part A (SAD), participants received single dose of study intervention (placebo and PF-06835375 0.03 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg) IV on the Day 1. The total infusion time was 120 minutes 10 minutes, unless a different time was needed to manage symptoms typical of infusion reactions. In Part B (MAD), participants received two doses of study intervention (placebo and PF-06835375 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, 10 mg) SC, with first dose on Day 1 and the repeated dose on Day 29. Efficacy Results: Overall, no obvious trends of absolute CFB were observed in SLEDAI-2K in SLE participants nor in DAS28-4 (CRP) in RA participants. Safety Results: Part A: SAD  A total of 30 (96.8%) participants experienced 144 all-causality TEAEs, of which 45 TEAEs in 15 (48.4%) participants were treatment-related: 5 TEAEs in 3 (37.5%) participants receiving placebo IV, 2 TEAEs in 1 (33.3%) participant receiving PF-06835375 0.1 mg IV, 7 TEAEs in 2 (66.7%) participants receiving PF-06835375 1 mg IV, 24 TEAEs in 6 (100.0%) participants receiving PF-06835375 3 mg IV and 7 TEAEs in 3 (60.0%) participants receiving PF-06835375 6 mg IV. No TEAEs were treatment-related in participants receiving PF-06835375 0.03 mg and 0.3 mg.  The which respectively.  SAEs were reported in 3 (9.7%) participants, with 1 participant receiving placebo IV, 1 participant receiving PF-06835375 0.03 mg IV and 1 participant receiving PF-06835375 0.3 mg IV. None of the SAEs were considered treatment-related by investigator.  Severe TEAEs were reported in 3 (9.7%) participants, with 1 participant receiving placebo IV, 1 participant receiving PF-06835375 0.03 mg IV and 1 participant receiving PF-06835375 6 mg IV.

One participant who received placebo IV experienced an AE of elevated CPK which was due to a concomitant medication and not considered to be related. Two TEAEs in 2 participants were considered clinically significant. The AE of elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT increased) reported by 1 participant receiving PF-06835375 1 mg IV was treatment-related, and 1 participant who received PF-06835375 3 mg IV experienced elevated liver enzymes (increase ALT and AST), which was not related to the study intervention but due to the use of alcohol intake.  Four increase 5 increase  Three ECG results meeting categorical criteria were reported as 3 treatment-related AEs in 3 participants and were considered clinically significant. One participant who received PF-06835375 0.1 mg IV experienced elevated heart rate with the maximum value reaching 96 beats/min. One participant who received PF-06835375 1 mg IV experienced elevated heart rate with the maximum value reaching 111 beats/min. One participant receiving PF-06835375 6 mg IV experienced flat T-waves. Part B: MAD  A total of 32 (76.2%) participants experienced 130 all-causality TEAEs, of which 39 TEAEs in 16 (38.1%) participants were treatment-related: 4 TEAEs in 3 (27.3%) participants receiving placebo SC, 9 TEAEs in 3 (50.0%) participants receiving PF-06835375 0.3 mg SC, 2 TEAEs in 1 (16.7%) participant receiving PF-06835375 1 mg SC, 17 TEAEs in 5 (71.4%) participants receiving PF-06835375 3 mg SC, 4 TEAEs in 2 (33.3%) participant receiving PF-06835375 6 mg SC and 3 TEAEs in 2 (33.3%) participants receiving PF-06835375 10 mg SC.  The participants).  No SAEs or severe TEAEs were reported in participants receiving multiple doses of study interventions.  There were no permanent discontinuations from study interventions, temporary discontinuations, or dose reductions due to AEs.

Infusion Related Reactions (IRR) and Injection Site Reactions (ISR)  As with other B-cell depleting agents, there is a risk for IRR and ISR with PF-06835375, which can be potentially severe. In the study, all participants were pre- medicated with acetaminophen and an anti-histamine to mitigate this risk of peri and post-infusion reactions, and investigators were allowed to manage infusion and/or injection reactions post dose should they occur. A total of 12 participants experienced 24 treatment-related TEAEs of IRR and ISR in this study. IRR, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and ISR were reported with the 3 mg IV dose. This prompted the addition of 100 mg IV methylprednisolone (Rituxan [prescribing information]. South San Francisco, CA: Genentech Inc; 1997) 1-2 hours prior to the start of the blinded study intervention and mitigated further reactions. One participant in the 3 mg SC cohort was reported to have an event of CRS (mild) but was categorized as an allergic reaction instead of an injection related reaction. No further events of CRS were reported after implementing corticosteroid dosing. As a mitigation for the rest of the other SC 3 mg cohort participants, the addition of 40 mg oral prednisone equivalent administration 0 to 2 hours prior to dosing, and subsequent 20 mg oral prednisone equivalent administration 4 hours post dosing was employed (Cohen S, Clowse M, Pardo M, et al. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of SBI-087, a CD20-directed B-cell depleting agent: Phase 1 dose escalating studies in patients with either mild rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus. Clin Ther 2016; 38(6):1417-34). The use of corticosteroids at dosing visits continued for the subsequent SC cohorts using the 6 mg and 10 mg doses. Pharmacokinetic Results: Part A: SAD Following single IV dosing of PF-06835375 at doses ranging from 0.03 mg to 6 mg, Cmax was observed within a median T of approximately 2 to 4 hours after the start of a 1-hour max infusion. After the achievement of C , serum concentrations exhibited a biphasic decline max over time, with mean and individual terminal t values ranging between 3.4 to 121.4 hours. ½ Following IV dosing, CL was slow with mean and individual values ranging between 0.021 to 0.313 L/hour across all doses. The V was low with mean and individual values ranging ss from 3.662 to 7.741 L. In general, exposure (AUC and C [individual and mean values]) max appeared to increase dose-proportional with increase in dose from 0.03 to 1 mg and more than dose-proportional for doses >1 mg. However, due to the low number of participants in the 0.03 mg and 0.1 mg dosing groups, the relationship between serum PK parameters and dose cannot be fully evaluated. Notably higher exposure was observed in 1 participant in the 0.3 mg treatment group which led to the high variability in this dose group. The cause of the higher exposure was unknown and therefore the PK parameters were included in the summaries. Participant variability in PF-06835375 exposure based on geometric coefficient of variation (CV) (%) ranged between 30%-2409% for AUC and 13%-197% for C . Part B: MAD Following SC administration of PF-06835375 at doses ranging from 1 mg to 10 mg, Cmax was reached within a median T of 144 to 170 hours on Day 1, and at similar times, max ranging from 121 to 171 hours, on Day 29. On Day 29, the geometric mean CL/F for SC doses were similar, with values between 0.07847 to 0.1171 L/hour and geometric mean V /F values ranged from 17.35 L to 34.92 L. z Mean terminal t values on Day 29 were between 162.0 to 234.0 hours. ½ In dose groups from 1 mg to 10 mg, serum PF-06835375 exposure (based on AUC and tau C ) appeared to increase greater than dose proportional on Day 1 and dose proportional on maxDay 29. Serum PF-06835375 accumulation ratio (R ) following Day 29 dosing ranged from ac approximately 1.7 to 3.0. R C was similar, ranging from approximately 1.3 to 2.7. ac, max Participant variability in PF-06835375 exposure Day 1 and Day 29 for the SC doses based on geometric CV% ranged between 84%-251% and 62%-154% for AUC and 79%-204% and tau 68%-224% for C , respectively. max Pharmacodynamic Results: B Cells and cTfh Cells Robust B and cTfh cell depletion were observed post dose in all the dose groups in Part A and Part B compared to participants receiving placebo. Generally, the extent and duration of depletion increased with increase in dose reaching saturation beyond 1 mg IV and 3 mg SC in Part A and Part B, respectively. Sustained depletion below 10 cells/µL was observed for the entire dosing interval of 4 weeks in dose groups above 3 mg SC in Part B. Td and MenB Antibody The functional effects of PF-06835375 on humoral immunity were evaluated using Td and MenB vaccine challenge. Robust vaccination responses were observed across the treatment groups. Biomarkers: hsCRP The geometric means for hsCRP in both SAD and MAD active treatment groups did not exceed 1.0 mg/dL (central lab reference range 0.0-1.0 mg/dL) for the first 16 weeks. No overall increasing hsCRP trends over time were observed in the active treatment arms for the first 16 weeks. Cytokines The geometric means for cytokines (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis and interferon gamma) in SAD increased post dose in Day 1 while the trend is not obvious in MAD. Immunogenicity Results: In the PF-06835375 IV SAD treatment groups, 7 of 23 (30.4%) ADA/NAb evaluable participants were tested ADA and NAb positive. In the PF-06835375 SC MAD treatment groups, 10 of 31 (32.3%) ADA evaluable participants and 7 of 31(22.6%) NAb evaluable participants were tested ADA and NAb positive, respectively. Three participants receiving PF-06835375 SC were tested ADA positive but NAb negative. All cohorts except the lowest IV doses (0.03 mg and 0.1 mg) have at least 1 ADA positive participant. The medians of first treatment-induced ADA and NAb detected were 31.5 and 36.0 day for all the participants receiving PF-06835375. No apparent major changes were observed in B and cTfh cell counts based on ADA and Nab status of participants. The presence of ADA/NAb did not appear to alter PF-06835375 PK in ADA/NAb-positive participants relative to those who were ADA/NAb negative. Conclusions: Safety:  Overall, no dose limiting toxicity AEs, no treatment-related SAEs, no deaths, permanent discontinuations from study/study intervention, temporary discontinuations, or dose reductions due to AEs were reported. Two severe TEAEs were treatment-related. Five abnormal laboratory tests reported as 3 TEAEs in 3 participants and 3 ECG results meeting categorical criteria reported as 3 treatment-related TEAEs in 3 participants were considered clinically significant.  Single ascending doses of PF-06835375 (0.03 mg, 0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg, and 6 mg) given as IV infusion and multiple ascending doses of PF-06835375 (0.3 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, and 10 mg) given as SC injection were generally safe and well tolerated in participants with seropositive SLE or RA enrolled in this study. No unexpected safety findings were observed.  Pre-and post-dose treatment with corticosteroids at doses of 3 mg IV, both 6 mg SC and IV, and 10 mg SC, mitigated symptoms of cytokine release syndrome.  No reports of COVID-19 infection were reported during the study with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the study. PK:  Following a single IV infusion of PF-06835375, exposure based on AUC and Cmax increased in a greater than a dose-proportional manner at doses greater than 1 mg. Geometric mean CL was slow with mean and individual values ranging between 0.021 to 0.313 L/hour across all doses. The V was low, indicating that the drug is ss primarily distributed in the serum volume, with mean and individual values ranging from 3.662 L to 7.741 L. Mean and individual terminal t values ranged between 3.4 ½ to 121.4 hours.  Following SC administration from 1 mg to 10 mg, C was reached within median max T of 144 to 170 hours on Day 1 and within 121 to 171 hours on Day 29. In dose max groups from 1 mg to 10 mg, serum PF-06835375 exposure (based on AUC and tau C ) appeared to increase greater than dose proportional on Day 1 and dose max proportional on Day 29. R for serum AUC and C were 1.770 to 2.977 and ac tau max 1.290 to 2.696, respectively. On Day 29, the geometric mean CL/F for SC doses were similar, with values between at 0.07847 to 0.1171 L/hour and geometric mean Vz/F values ranged from 17.35 L to 34.92 L. Mean terminal t values on Day 29 were ½ between 162.0 to 234.0 hours. PD:  Robust B and cTfh cell depletion were observed post dose in all the dose groups in Part A and Part B compared to participants receiving placebo. Generally, the extent and duration of depletion increased with increase in doses reaching saturation beyond 3 mg SC and 1 mg IV. Sustained depletion below 10 cells/µL was observed for the entire dosing interval of 4 weeks in dose groups above 3 mg SC in Part B.  In Part A (SAD) and Part B (MAD), the B cell counts in all SLE and RA participants receiving PF-06835375 markedly decreased at 8 h post-dose on Day 1. Compared with participants receiving placebo, almost all SLE and RA participants receiving PF-06835375 had lower B cell counts. By Day 113, mean B cell counts were above 10 cells/µl for all dose groups. Td/MenB vaccination did not appear to have any influence on B cell counts for all SLE and RA patients receiving PF-06835375.  In Part A (SAD) and Part B (MAD), the cTfh cell ratio in all RA and SLE participants receiving PF-06835375 higher doses (1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg IV in SAD and 3 mg, 6 mg, 10 mg in MAD) markedly decreased to nearly ≤0.1 at 8 h post-dose on Day 1. In Part B (MAD), the cTfh cell ratios kept low around 0.1 and decreased again after the second study intervention dosing on Day 29. Compared with participants receiving placebo who had cTfH cell ratio fluctuated among 0.1 to 3 post dose, almost all SLE post dose. The cTfh cell ratios in all SLE and RA participants receiving PF-06835375 were not obviously influenced by Td/MenB vaccination on Day 4 and the second MenB vaccination on Day 57. Only a slight increase after Day 57 was observed in a few participants.  No obvious relevance was observed in CRP values regarding to the B cell counts/cTfh cell counts and Td/MenB vaccinations.  Despite the robust B-cell and cTfh cell depletion, immune responses to Td vaccinations were observed. Immunogenicity:  All cohorts except the lowest IV doses (0.03 mg and 0.1 mg) have at least 1 ADA positive participant. Of 54 participants dosed with PF-06835375, 17 (31.5%) tested positive for ADAs; and 14 (25.9%) tested positive for NAbs.  The median time of onset for treatment-induced ADA and NAb was 31.5 and 36.0 days respectively.  Immunogenicity data does not suggest any clinically relevant impact on PK, B/cTfh cell depletion or safety. Biomarkers:  HsCRP: Although fluctuations were observed over time in hsCRP for both IV and SC cohorts, no obvious trends were observed, or relationship to B cell or Tfh cell depletion.  Cytokines: In general, interleukin-6 levels appear to increase following dosing, then diminishing towards baseline levels, tumor necrosis factor levels also appear to increase following dosing, while interferon gamma levels did not appear to change surrounding dosing times. These observations in interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor levels surrounding dosing times and B cell/Tfh cell depletion support the use of pre- and post-dose treatment with corticosteroids to mitigate symptoms of CRS at doses of 3 mg IV, both 6 mg IV and SC and 10 mg SC.
