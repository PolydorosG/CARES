Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Participants were healthy adults who were 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent document, with a body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 40 kg/m2 and a total body weight >50 kg (110 lb). Attempts were made to ensure that the demographic characteristics, gender, race, and ethnicity of the healthy control group (Cohort 3) was comparable to that in the renal impairment groups (Cohort 1: moderate renal impairment group; Cohort 2: mild renal impairment group; and Cohort 4: severe renal impairment group). Healthy participants were matched such that age was within ±10 years and weight was within ±15 kg of the renally impaired participants. Study Treatment: On Day -1, 12 hours prior to dosing of PF-07321332, participants received a 100 mg ritonavir tablet. On Day 1, following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, participants received 100 mg PF-07321332 and 100 mg ritonavir at approximately 0800 hours. Participants received 2 additional doses of 100 mg ritonavir at 12 and 24 hours after receiving PF-07321332. The investigational product information is provided in Table S2. Table S2.

Pharmacokinetic and Other Evaluations: Blood and urine samples collected for measurement of PF-07321332 and ritonavir in plasma and PF-07321332 in urine were analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with Pfizer’s applicable standard operating procedures. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring, laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Statistical Methods: The safety dataset included all participants randomly assigned to study treatment and who took at least 1 dose of study treatment. A set of summary tables split by cohort was produced for the safety analysis. The PK analysis set included all participants who had at least 1 of the PK parameters of primary interest. Analysis of variance was used to compare the natural log transformed AUC and C for PF-07321332 between normal renal inf max function group (reference) and each impaired renal function group separately as applicable (test). RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 35 participants were assigned to treatment and 34 of them were treated, 8 each in the mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment group and 10 in the healthy control group. One participant in the moderate renal impairment group was discontinued because of an AE before any PF-07321332 administration. Another participant in the severe renal impairment group was discontinued from study due to an AE, after the last dose of study treatment. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age across 4 renal impairment groups was 62.2 (7.45) years, ranging from 47 to 76 years. The overall mean (SD) weight and BMI across the 4 renal function groups was 86.75 (13.88) kg and 29.37 (3.89) kg/m2, respectively. Gender and race distribution across the 4 renal function groups was approximately 2:1 for male to female and White to Black/African American. Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done. Pharmacokinetic Results: PK parameters for PF-07321332 are summarized in Table S3. Following a single oral administration of PF-07321332 100 mg enhanced with ritonavir 100 mg administered at -12, 0, 12, and 24 hours relative to PF-07321332 dosing, mean C values were achieved at max median T of 2.0 hours post dose in the normal renal function group and mild renal max impairment group, and 2.5 and 3.0 hours post dose for participants in the moderate and severe renal impairment groups, respectively. PF-07321332 systemic exposure increased with increasing severity of renal impairment, with mean AUC values of approximately inf 24%, 87%, and 204% higher for the mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment groups, respectively, compared to the normal renal functional group. Geometric mean C values max also increased approximately 30%, 38%, and 48% for the mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment groups, respectively, compared to the normal renal functional group. Mean CL/F values for the mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment groups were 5.58 L/hr, 3.69 L/hr, and 2.27 L/hr, respectively, compared to 6.91 L/hr for the normal renal function group. Mean t values were longer in the moderate and severe renal impairment groups with mean values ½of 10 hours and 13.4 hours, respectively, compared to mean t values of 7.7 hours and ½ 6.6 hours for the normal real functional group and mild renal impairment group, respectively. A decrease in renal clearance was observed especially for the moderate and severe renal impairment groups with an approximately 47% and 80% decrease in geometric mean CLr values, respectively, compared to the normal renal functional group. Results of the statistical comparisons for PF-07321332 adjusted geometric mean (90% confidence interval [CI]) AUC test/reference ratios comparing the varying degrees of inf renal impairment (test) to normal renal function (reference) were 123.84% (99.64%, 153.91%), 187.40% (148.52%, 236.46%), and 304.49% (237.60%, 390.21%) for participants with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment. Adjusted geometric mean (90% CI) C test/reference ratios were 129.78% (101.93%, 165.25%), 138.12% max (113.18%, 168.55%) and 148.02% (111.40%, 196.68%) for participants with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment. AUCinf 14460 (20) 17910 (30) 27110 (27) 44040 (33) Safety Results: All-causality AEs were reported by 2 participants in the normal renal function group and by 1, 1 and 5 participants in the mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment groups, respectively. All-causality AEs were most frequently reported under the system organ classes (SOCs) of Gastrointestinal disorders, General disorders and administration site conditions, and Nervous system disorders. Treatment related AEs were reported by 2 participants in the severe renal impairment group. There were 4 treatment related AEs under the SOCs of Gastrointestinal disorders and Nervous system disorders. All 4 treatment related AEs occurred in the severe renal impairment group and were mild in severity. Three SAEs, including 1 Pulmonary oedema, 1 Acute kidney injury, and 1 Pneumonia, were reported for 1 participant in the severe renal impairment group, and were considered not related to the study treatment. One moderate AE of Bradycardia was reported in the participant described above with 3 SAEs and this event was considered not treatment related. During the treatment phase, no other clinically significant ECG findings were reported. No deaths, temporary discontinuation, dose reductions due to AEs, or medication errors were reported during this study. There were no significant laboratory trends observed in this study. Conclusions:  PF-07321332 systemic exposure increased with increasing severity of renal impairment. Results of the statistical comparisons for PF-07321332 adjusted geometric mean (90% CI) AUC test/reference ratios comparing the varying degrees of renal inf impairment (test) to normal renal function (reference) were 123.84% (99.64%, 153.91%) for participants with mild renal impairment, 187.40% (148.52%, 236.46%) for participants with moderate renal impairment, and 304.49% (237.60%, 390.21%) for participants with severe renal impairment. Adjusted geometric mean (90% CI) Cmax test/reference ratios were 129.78% (101.93%, 165.25%) for participants with mild renal impairment, 138.12% (113.18%, 168.55%) for participants with moderate renal impairment, and 148.02% (111.40%, 196.68%) for participants with severe renal impairment.  Results of the regression analysis using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) showed a decrease in CL/F for PF-07321332 with an increase in severity of renal impairment. Renal clearance also decreased especially for the moderate and severe renal impairment groups with an approximately 47% and 80% decrease in geometric mean CLr values, respectively, compared to the normal renal functional group.  Urinary recovery of unchanged PF-07321332 was 31.2%, 42.7%, 30.8%, and 18.5% for the normal functional group, mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment groups, respectively.  Single oral administration of PF-07321332 (100 mg) in combination with ritonavir (100 mg) has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in adult participants with normal and impaired (mild, moderate, and severe) renal function. All treatment related AEs were mild in nature. Overall, there were no significant findings in laboratory trends, or vital sign measurements and ECG assessments observed in the study.
