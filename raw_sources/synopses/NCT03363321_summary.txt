Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation Date: 30 May 2018 Study Completion Date: 05 August 2020 Report Date: 19 January 2021 Previous Report Date(s): Not applicable Phase of Development: Phase 2 Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: The primary and secondary study objectives and endpoints are presented in Table S1. Table S1. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: B7841003 (hereafter referred to as Study 1003) was an open-label long-term (treatment of up to 365 days) evaluation of marstacimab as a prophylactic treatment regimen in participants with hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors to factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX). Investigators, participants, site staff and sponsor study team members were not blinded to treatment assignment. Participants were assigned to treatment cohorts as indicated in Figure S1 below. Figure S1. B7841003 Dose Assignment Participants enrolled in Study 1003 from Cohort 1 (marstacimab 300 mg subcutaneous [SC]) of Study B7841002 (hereafter referred to as Study 1002) continued with their assigned dose level at the completion of Study 1002. All other participants enrolled in Study 1003 received the lowest dose level determined to be safe and efficacious for the respective hemophilia population in Study 1002. De novo participants (adolescents with or without inhibitors and adults with inhibitors) with severe hemophilia A or B were eligible for enrollment following completion of all SC cohorts (ie, after Cohort 3) through 3 months of treatment in Study 1002. Approximately 36 participants (24 participants from Study 1002 and 12 additional de novo participants) were planned for enrollment at approximately 20 study sites. The maximum total duration of the study for a participant who completed Study 1002 was approximately 14 months (excluding screening and any interruption in treatment prior to approval of Protocol Amendment 2). The maximum total duration of the study for de novo participants, from initial screening to final follow up, was approximately 15 months. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Participants continuing from Study 1002 within 30 days of the Study 1003 - Day 1 visit did not require screening procedures to confirm eligibility: male participants with severe hemophilia A or B of ≥18 and 75 years old, with body mass index (BMI) of ≥17.5 and ≤30.5 kg/m2 and a total body weight of ≥50 and ≤100 kg were eligible to participate in the study. For de novo participants: adolescent males of ≥12 to 18 years old with BMI of ≥14 kg/m2 and a total body weight of ≥30 kg (only for Cohort 5) and adults, who had at least 6 acute bleeding episodes (spontaneous/traumatic) during the 6-month period prior to screening were eligible. Study Treatment: Participants enrolled in Study 1003 from Cohort 1 (300 mg SC) of Study 1002 continued with their assigned dose level at the completion of Study 1002. All other participants enrolled in Study 1003 (following participation in Study 1002) received the lowest SC dose level determined to be safe and efficacious in Study 1002 for the respective hemophilia population: 300 mg SC loading dose on Day 1, followed by 150 mg SC once weekly (QW) for non-inhibitor participants; 300 mg SC QW for inhibitor participants. De novo participants received a 300 mg SC loading dose on Day 1, followed by 150 mg SC QW. All doses were administered by the SC route.

Efficacy Evaluations: Frequency and annualized rate of bleeding episodes from Day 1 up to (FVIII or FIX) therapy for treatment of breakthrough bleeding episodes is another secondary efficacy endpoint, but the analysis of this endpoint was not implemented to be consistent with the analysis in Study 1002. The annualized bleed rate (ABR) during the 6 months prior to study participation (for de novo participants: 6 months prior to participation in Study 1003; for roll over participants: 6 months prior to participation in Study 1002) was collected and presented as baseline. Prophylaxis efficacy was assessed by collecting the number of acute bleeding episodes per participant during the treatment period of up to 365 days and determining the ABR. For participants continuing from Study 1002 on the same dose, these data may be combined between the studies to determine the ABR. Statistical Methods: Safety The safety analysis was conducted in the safety analysis set. All participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication in Study 1003 were included in the safety analyses and listings. Marstacimab safety data were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Efficacy The efficacy analysis was conducted in the Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS). The PPAS was a subset of the safety analysis set. This set excluded participants with major protocol deviations. Descriptive statistics of ABR during the course of Study 1003 was generated by cohort and dose level. ABR was also summarized separately by hemophilia type following the same table format. In addition, ABR data from Study 1003 was also pooled with data from Study 1002 to evaluate the long-term effect of marstacimab. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Twenty-four individuals were screened, of which, 4 individuals failed at screening (Table S3). All the 20 participants who met the eligibility criteria were assigned to the study treatment and were treated with marstacimab. Among 20 participants treated with marstacimab, 18 participants completed the study, and 2 participants (1 in the 300 mg loading + 150 mg – 300 mg loading + 150 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort and the other in the 300 mg – 300 mg inhibitor dose cohort) discontinued from study due to withdrawal by participant which was not related to safety (Table S4). All 20 participants were male. The median age ranged from 20.0 years (de novo 300 mg loading + 150 mg inhibitors dose cohort) to 45.5 years (450 mg – 300 mg loading + 150 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort). Among the overall 300 mg dose cohorts and the overall 300 mg loading + 150 mg dose cohorts, individual values ranged from 27 to 50 years and 19 to 57 years, respectively. Among the overall 300 mg dose cohorts, all 10 participants were of White (6/10, 60.0%) or Black/African American (4/10, 40.0%). Among the overall 300 mg loading + 150 mg dose cohorts, all 10 participants were of White (8/10, 80.0%) or Black/African American (2/10, 20.0%). The median weight ranged from 62.0 kg (300 mg loading + 150 mg – 300 mg loading + 150 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort) to 86.7 kg (450 mg – 300 mg loading + 150 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort). Among the overall 300 mg dose cohorts and the overall 300 mg loading + 150 mg dose cohorts, individual values ranged from 53.6 to 96.5 kg and 50.7 to 86.7 kg, respectively. The BMI data was only collected in de novo 300 mg loading + 150 mg inhibitors dose cohort, in which the median (range) BMI was 20.67 (17.9-23.4) kg/m2. Among the overall 300 mg dose cohorts, all 10 participants had hemophilia A. Among the overall 300 mg loading + 150 mg dose cohorts, 9 (90.0%) participants had hemophilia A and 1 (10.0%) participant had hemophilia B. CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS CLINICAL STUDY REPORT SYNOPSIS Safety Results: There were no deaths, no permanent discontinuation, dose reduction or temporary discontinuation due to AEs reported during the study. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), regardless of causality, was low in this study. No thrombotic events were reported in this study. Among the overall 300 mg dose cohorts, there were 15 all-causality TEAEs reported by 7 (70.0%) participants. Of these, 2 TEAEs were determined by the investigator as treatment-related, and were reported by 2 (20.0%) participants. There was 1 (10.0%) participant who experienced SAEs which were not determined by the investigator to be treatment-related. There was 1 (10.0%) participant who experienced Grade 3 or 4 AEs which were not determined by the investigator to be treatment-related. Among the overall 300 mg loading + 150 mg dose cohorts, there were 24 all-causality TEAEs reported by 7 (70.0%) participants. Of these, 1 TEAE was determined by the investigator as treatment-related, and was reported by 1 (10.0%) participant. No participants experienced SAEs among these cohorts. There was 1 (10.0%) participant who experienced Grade 3 or 4 AEs which were not determined by the investigator to be treatment-related. Among the overall 300 mg dose cohorts, the most commonly reported TEAEs, regardless of causality, were in the System Organ Classes (SOCs) of General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (3 participants, 30.0%) and Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications (3 participants, 30.0%). The most frequently reported TEAE, regardless of causality, was haemarthrosis (2 participants, 20.0%). The majority of all-causality TEAEs were of Grade 1 (5 participants, 50.0%). One (10.0%) participant had all-causality Grade 2 TEAEs and 1 (10.0%) participant had all-causality Grade 3 TEAEs. One participant from the 300 mg - 300 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort had a Grade 3 non-serious non-treatment-related TEAE of skull fracture and a Grade 3 serious non-treatment-related TEAE of cerebral haemorrhage. Among the overall 300 mg loading + 150 mg dose cohorts, the most commonly reported TEAEs, regardless of causality, were in the SOCs of Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (3 participants, 30.0%) and Vascular Disorders (3 participants, 30.0%). The most frequently reported TEAE, regardless of causality, was haematoma (2 participants, 20.0%). The majority of all-causality TEAEs were of Grade 1 (4 participants, 40.0%) and Grade 2 (2 participants, 20.0%). One (10.0%) participant had all-causality Grade 3 TEAEs; this participant from the de novo 300 mg loading + 150 mg inhibitors dose cohort had a Grade 3 non-serious non-treatment-related TEAE of arthralgia. Among the overall 300 mg dose cohorts, 2 treatment-related Grade 1 TEAEs (injection site haematoma and injection site reaction) were reported in 1 participant each (10.0%). Among the overall 300 mg loading + 150 mg dose cohorts, 1 treatment-related Grade 2 TEAE of injection site reaction was reported in 1 participant (10.0%). One participant from the 300 mg - 300 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort experienced 2 SAEs: cerebral haemorrhage (Grade 3) and generalised tonic-clonic seizure (Grade 2), which were both not considered to be treatment-related by the investigator. Two spontaneous SAEs were reported outside the study reporting period for 2 participants. The SAEs reported were inflammation (verbatim term: severe inflammatory response to spontaneous bleed). Both events were considered by the investigator to be an important medical event, resolved without sequelae and were not treatment-related. AEs of special interest were reported in 11 participants, which included haemarthrosis, injection site haematoma, injection site reaction, contusion, haematoma, skin haemorrhage, hypertension, oedema peripheral, and medical errors (underdose, overdose, incorrect dose administration, treatment noncompliance, inappropriate schedule of product and administration). No participant’s liver function values in any treatment group met the criteria for Hy’s Law. None of the laboratory test abnormalities were considered to be clinically significant or reported as AEs by the investigator. There were no clinically significant abnormalities observed for prothrombin, fibrinogen and troponin I. In the 450 mg – 300 mg loading + 150 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort, 1 participant had supine SBP increase from baseline ≥30 mm Hg and supine DBP increase from baseline ≥20 mm Hg; this participant had a Grade 1 non-treatment-related AE of hypertension. In the 300 mg – 300 mg inhibitor dose cohort, 1 participant had supine DBP increase from baseline ≥20 mm Hg; this participant had a Grade 1 non-treatment-related AE of hypertension. None of the ECG data met the pre-defined categorical summarization criteria. No consistent pattern was observed in the physical examination findings. One participant from the 300 mg – 300 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort had mild AEs of injection site reaction on Day 112 and Day 316. One participant from the de novo 300 mg loading + 150 mg inhibitors dose cohort had a severe AE of injection site reaction. One participant from the 300 mg – 300 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort had a mild AE of injection site haematoma. All these AEs were determined to be treatment-related by the investigator. Efficacy Results: The ABR was calculated as ([number of bleeding events × 365.25] / observed treatment period in days). Across all dose cohorts during this study, the mean and median on-study ABR ranged from 0 to 3.586 and 0 to 2.488 bleeding episodes per participant per year, respectively, demonstrating comparable efficacy observed in the short-term parent Study 1002. Among the 300 mg loading + 150 mg – 300 mg loading + 150 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort, 1 participant with hemophilia A had the maximum on-study ABR (14.35 bleeding episodes per participant per year). In the medical judgement of the investigator, the participant’s high ABR was not considered to be representative of lack of efficacy of the investigational product but rather due to the participant’s history of cyclical increases in ABR due to increased activity. Out of the 20 participants in Study 1003, there was 1 participant with hemophilia B from the 300 mg loading + 150 mg – 300 mg loading + 150 mg non-inhibitor dose cohort, who completed the study and had no bleeding events during the study. There was a numerical reduction in ABR in the on-study treatment phase versus that reported for the pre-treatment (pre-study) phase in all dose cohorts. Conclusions: Safety  Long-term treatment with marstacimab was generally safe and well-tolerated in severe hemophilia A or B participants with or without inhibitors.  There were no thrombotic events in this study. Efficacy  The efficacy result shown in Study 1002 for the duration of 3 months was maintained in this long-term study where participants were treated up to 1 year across all dose cohorts - inhibitors and non-inhibitors, 150 mg and 300 mg maintenance doses, and hemophilia A and B.
