Primary Study Objectives and Endpoints Type Objective Endpoint PK To characterize the PK of PF-07321332 PF-07321332 plasma PK parameters: following multiple doses when T , t , AUC , CL/F, and V /F for max ½ last z PF-07321332/ritonavir is administered PF-07321332 with and without alone or with itraconazole in healthy coadministration of itraconazole participants Abbreviations: AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last last measurable concentration; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to tau time tau (τ), where tau = 12-hour dosing interval; C = maximum observed concentration; max CL/F = apparent clearance; ECG = electrocardiogram; t = terminal half-life; TEAE = treatment emergent ½ adverse event; T = time for C ; V /F = apparent volume of distribution max max z METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 1, open-label, 2-period, fixed sequence crossover study to estimate the effect of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole, on the PK of PF-07321332 in healthy participants. In Period 1, participants received PF-07321332/ritonavir 300/100 mg orally every 12 hours (q12h) for a total of 5 doses, with the last dose administered on the morning of Day 3. In Period 2, participants received itraconazole 200 mg orally once a day (QD) for 8 days. On Days 4 through 6 of Period 2, participants received PF-07321332/ritonavir 300/100 mg orally q12h for a total of 5 doses. A total of approximately 12 healthy participants were planned to be enrolled into the study. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Participants were healthy adults who were 18 to 60 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent document (ICD), with a body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2 and a total body weight >50 kg (110 lb). Study Treatment: Participants received the following oral treatments:  In Period 1, participants received PF-07321332/ritonavir 300/100 mg administered orally q12h for a total of 5 doses, from Day 1 morning to Day 3 morning.  In Period 2, Days 1 through 8, participants received itraconazole 200 mg orally QD from Days 1 through 8; and PF-07321332/ritonavir 300/100 mg administered orally q12h from Days 4 through 6, for a total of 5 doses, starting with the first dose on the morning of Period 2, Day 4 and the last dose administered on the morning of Period 2, Day 6.

Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) monitoring, laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Statistical Methods: The safety analysis set included all participants received at least 1 dose of study treatment. PK analysis set included the concentration analysis set and parameter analysis set. The concentration analysis set included all participants who took at least 1 dose of the study intervention and in whom at least 1 concentration value was reported; and the parameter analysis set included all participants who took at least 1 dose of study intervention and in whom at least 1 of the PK parameters of interest were reported. The PK data and safety data were summarized and listed according to the sponsor’s reporting standard. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 12 participants were assigned to treatment and received treatment with PF-07321332/ritonavir 300/100 mg in Period 1. One participant discontinued due to withdrawal. The remaining 11 participants completed Period 1 and continued to receive itraconazole 200 mg + PF-07321332/ritonavir 300/100 mg in Period 2 and all completed Period 2. Efficacy Results: Efficacy evaluations were not done. Pharmacokinetic Results: PK parameters for PF-07321332 are summarized in Table S3. Following multiple twice a day (BID) oral dosing of PF-07321332/ritonavir 300/100 mg administered alone or with 200 mg QD of itraconazole, PF-07321332 mean C was observed in a median T (range) of max max 1.02 (0.500 to 2.08) hours post dose for PF-07321332/ritonavir administered alone, and 1.70 (0.500 to 4.00) hours post dose following co-administration with itraconazole. PF-07321332 mean t was 8.26 hours following PF-07321332/ritonavir 300/100 mg ½ administered alone and 7.79 hours following co-administration with itraconazole. An increase in PF-07321332 systemic exposure was observed following coadministration with itraconazole. The test/reference ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% CIs) for PF-07321332 AUC and C were 138.82% (129.25%, 149.11%) and 118.57% tau max (112.50%, 124.97%), respectively, when PF-07321332 was co-administered with multiple oral doses of itraconazole (Test) compared to administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir alone (Reference). PF-07321332 mean CL/F values were 8.990 L/hr when PF-07321332/ritonavir administered alone versus 6.478 L/hr when co-administered with itraconazole.
