Time to ≥2 METHODS Study Design: This was a Phase 3b/4, multicenter, randomized, assessor blinded, vehicle and active controlled study of the efficacy, safety and local tolerability of crisaborole ointment, 2% in pediatric and adult subjects (ages 2 years and older) with mild to moderate AD involving at least 5% treatable %BSA. Treatment was clinical assessor blinded for all treatment groups and double blinded for crisaborole ointment, 2% and vehicle treatment arm (Figure S1). During the study C3291037, efficacy and safety of crisaborole were compared with vehicle in participants age ≥2 years with mild to moderate AD. The study was designed to provide contextualization of the safety and efficacy of crisaborole compared with hydrocortisone butyrate cream, 0.1% (topical corticosteroid [TCS]) and pimecrolimus cream, 1% (topical calcineurin inhibitor [TCI]), the 2 prevalent treatment options for treatment of mild to moderate AD. Figure S1. Protocol C3291037, Study Design Schematic Following the screening period of up to 35 days, eligible subjects were randomized (1:1:2) at Baseline/Day 1 visit to crisaborole 2%, vehicle, or active comparator (TCI or TCS). Randomization was stratified by eligibility for TCS or TCI treatment as per national approved labels. Cohort 1 included subjects eligible for TCS therapy and Cohort 2 included subjects not eligible for TCS therapy but eligible for TCI therapy. The investigational products were applied BID for 28 days to the treatable BSA (excluding the scalp) identified at Baseline/Day 1. The global study was terminated early in October 2020 due to Sponsor business decision and portfolio reprioritization. This decision was not a result of any safety or efficacy concerns. A total of 235 participants were treated across 4 study treatment treatment groups, instead of originally planned 600 participants (39.2% of planned enrollment). This study was originally designed to compare the treatment of crisaborole versus vehicle, and not powered to compare the treatment effect between crisaborole and TCS, as well as crisaborole and TCI. Due to study early termination, less than 40% of planned participants were treated across the 4 treatment goups, thereby resulting in insufficient power for the comparison of crisaborole vs vehicle. Consequently, because cohort 1 and cohort 2 crisaborole treatment groups had even smaller sample sizes, the contextualization of the treatment effect of crisaborole compared to TCS and TCI was not possible. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Key inclusion criteria were as follows: 1. Age 2 years or older at the Screening visit/time of informed consent/assent. 2. Clinical diagnosis of AD according to the criteria of Hanifin and Rajka. 3. AD involvement of ≥5% Treatable %BSA (excluding the scalp) at Baseline/Day 1. 4. ISGA score of Mild (2) or Moderate (3) (excluding the scalp) at Baseline/Day 1. 5. Cohort specific inclusion criteria: Cohort 1: Subjects considered to be a candidate for hydrocortisone butyrate cream, 0.1% therapy according to the national approved labeling. Cohort 2: Subjects not considered candidates for treatment with a topical corticosteroid because it was either inadvisable or not appropriate according to the national approved labeling. This may have included: intolerance to or lack of effect of TCSs or use on the body regions where treatment with TCS may have been inappropriate. Study Treatment: Dosing and duration: Study intervention was applied BID (12 4 hours apart) to all treatable AD involved areas (excluding the scalp) identified at Baseline/Day 1 through Day 28.

Number of participants enrolled in the study at the time of study termination was insufficient to allow meaningful and robust statistical analyses. As a result, all the safety data were summarized with Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 combined for the crisaborole and vehicle groups. In addition, only descriptive summaries for primary efficacy and secondary efficacy endpoints pre-specified prior to the database lock were completed. Whenever possible, descriptive summaries were completed by age subgroup (2-17 years and ≥18 years). No summaries were generated for tertiary/exploratory endpoints. Efficacy Evaluations: Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  Percent change from Baseline in the EASI total score at Day 29. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Clinical Assessments and Patient Reported Outcomes/ Observer Reported Outcomes):  Percent change from Baseline in EASI total score by scheduled time points during Treatment Period until Day 29.  Percent change in EASI total score from Day 29 to Day 43 (Follow-Up Period).  Achievement of success in ISGA at scheduled timepoints during Treatment Period.  Achievement of ISGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) at scheduled time points during Treatment Period.  Achievement of EASI75 (≥75% improvement from Baseline) at scheduled time points during Treatment Period  Time to EASI75.  Change in % BSA from Baseline to scheduled time points during Treatment Period. Pre-Specified Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (PROs/ObsROs):  Change from Baseline in Peak Pruritus NRS by scheduled time points (Subjects ≥12 years of age).  Achievement of ≥2 point improvement from Baseline in Peak Pruritus NRS (subjects >12 years of age).  Achievement of ≥3 point improvement from Baseline in Peak Pruritus NRS for subjects >12 years.  Change from Baseline in DLQI score by scheduled time points (Subjects ≥16 years of age).  Change from Baseline in CDLQI score by scheduled time points (Subjects 4 to15 years of age).  Change from Baseline in DFI score completed by parent/caregiver by scheduled time points (Subjects 2 to17 years of age). Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Evaluations: Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, pharmacogenomic, and/or other evaluations were not conducted. Safety Evaluations: Safety assessments included AEs, SAEs, local tolerability, discontinuations, and clinically significant changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters. Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 were combined for the crisaborole and vehicle groups for all safety summaries. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject Disposition Subjects were randomized at 26 sites in 7 countries, including the United States (US) (n=151), Germany (n=37), Italy (n=17), Poland (n=14), Switzerland (n=9), Sweden (n=6), United Kingdom (n=1). At the time of study termination, all participants who were randomized and on study treatment were allowed to complete the study; participants who had signed the informed consent document (ICD) but had not yet been randomized were discontinued from the study. A summary of disposition events during the treatment phase and follow-up phase is presented in Table S3. Demography Baseline demographic characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups and within the age subgroups of 2-17 years and ≥18 years. The median age was 14 years (range for total SAF population: 2- 78 years; range across treatment groups: 13 to 15 years). Majority of the participants were female (59.1%; range across groups: 55.3% to 60.6%), white (66.8%; range across groups: 62.0% to 78.7%), and not Hispanic or Latino (90.6%; range across groups: 84.5% to 98.3%). There were more participants in the subgroup of 2-17 years (61.3%) than in the subgroup of ≥18 years (38.7%). Baseline Disease Characteristics  Median duration of AD: 8.78 years (range across groups: 7.54 years to 9.44 years)  Received prior TCS/TCI treatment: 37.9% (range across groups: 28.2% to 59.6%) participants had received prior TCS/TCI treatment. TCS group had the least and TCI had the most proportion of participants with prior TCS/TCI treatment  ISGA: Baseline AD was assessed as moderate in 58.3% (range across groups: 48.9% to 66.1%) and mild in 41.7% (range across groups: 33.9% to 51.1%) of the participants. Mean ISGA score was 2.6 (range across groups: 2.5 to 2.7).  Median EASI total score was 8.00; (range across groups: 7.0 to 10.20)  Median %BSA affected was 10.0 (range across groups: 8.0 to 11.0)  Median Peak Pruritis NRS (for age ≥12 years) score was 5.86 (range across groups: 5.33 to 6.07)  Median DLQI (for age ≥16 years) score was 8.0 (range across groups: 6.5 to 9.5)  Median CDLQI (for age 4-15 years) score was 7.0 (range across groups: 6.0 to 8.5)  Median DFI (for 2-17 years) score was 6.0 (range across groups: 4.0 to 7.5) Efficacy Results: The number of participants enrolled in this study was insufficient to allow meaningful and robust statistical analyses. Statistically or clinically meaningful inferences could not be drawn from the descriptive summaries for the efficacy endpoints because of the inherent variability associated with the small sample size. The descriptive data summaries for efficacy endpoints suggest numerically greater improvement in the crisaborole group than in the vehicle group. This study was originally designed to compare the treatment of crisaborole vs vehicle, and not powered to compare the treatment effect between crisaborole and TCS, as well as crisaborole and TCI. Due to study groups, thereby resulting in insufficient power for the comparison of crisaborole vs vehicle. Consequently, because cohort 1 and cohort 2 crisaborole treatment groups had even smaller sample sizes, the contextualization of the treatment effect of crisaborole compared to TCS and TCI was not possible. The sample size in the age subgroups (2-17 years and ≥18 years) was limited, especially in the crisaborole cohorts. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Crisaborole vs Vehicle, Percent Change in EASI Total Score from Baseline at Day 29 (End of Treatment Period)  Data for the primary comparison suggest numerically greater improvement in the EASI total score in the crisaborole group than in the vehicle group. However, statistical comparison was not conducted given the small sample size (Table S4). (Min,Max) Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, Immunogenicity and/or Other Results: Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, pharmacogenomic, immunogenicity and/or other evaluations were not conducted. Safety Results: Crisaborole was well tolerated and no new safety information was identified. The observed safety events were consistent with those seen in other crisaborole studies.  Most of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported were mild.  No SAEs and no deaths were reported in the study.  The incidence of permanent discontinuations from the study and/or study intervention due to TEAEs was low.  Interpretation of the data is limited because of the inherent variability associated with the small sample size, as a result, no trends or comparisons between the treatment groups are drawn.  Similar frequencies of TEAEs and discontinuation rates were observed in both age sub- groups of crisaborole-treated participants.  Of the total treatment-related TEAEs, most were reported in the treatment area and all were considered mild or moderate.  The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAE PTs were application site pain and dermatitis atopic.  Application site pain was the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAE in the crisaborole treatment group which is consistent with the known safety profile of crisaborole.  The incidence of application site pain was higher in participants age 2-17 years than in participants age ≥18 years.  Dermatitis-related TEAEs occurred more frequently in the vehicle and TCI groups.  TEAEs potentially attributable to systemic phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4) inhibition (Gastrointestinal [GI] Disorders System Organ Class [SOC]) occurred infrequently; these TEAEs occured with similar incidence across the 4 treatment groups, and were assessed as not related to the study treatment. No other TEAEs potentially associated with systemic PDE-4 inhibition (eg, insomnia, anxiety, suicide ideation, serious infections, malignancy) were observed.  No new safety issues were identified from clinical laboratory or vital signs findings. Conclusion(s): Efficacy Baseline demographic characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. Due to study early termination, less than 40% of planned participants were treated across the 4 treatment groups, thereby resulting in insufficient power for the comparison of crisaborole vs vehicle. Consequently, because cohort 1 and cohort 2 crisaborole treatment groups had even smaller sample sizes, the contextualization of the treatment effect of crisaborole compared to TCS and TCI was not possible. Insufficient sample size and statistical limitations render following suggested trends in efficacy observations inconclusive:  Numerical improvement appeared to be greater in crisaborole, TCS, and TCI groups than in vehicle group.  The efficacy observations in each of the age subgroups of 2-17 years and ≥18 years were largely similar to the overall population; the sample size in these subgroups, especially in the crisaborole cohorts, was small. Safety  Crisaborole was well tolerated and no new safety information was identified. The observed safety events were consistent with those seen in other crisaborole studies involving participants of the same age range.  Most of the TEAEs reported were mild.  No SAEs and no deaths were reported in the study.  No new safety issues were identified from clinical laboratory or vital signs findings.
