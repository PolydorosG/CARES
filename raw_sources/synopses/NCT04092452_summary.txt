Table S1. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints a. HiSCR required: • At least a 50% reduction in the total AN count relative to baseline; and • No increase in abscess count; and • No increase in draining fistula count. For all endpoints, baseline was defined as the result closest prior to dosing on Day 1. METHODS Study Design: This study was a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter platform study with 3 kinase inhibitors (PF-06650833, or Zimlovisertib, an interleukin-1 [IL-1] receptor associated kinase 4 [IRAK4] inhibitor; PF-06700841, or Brepocitinib, a tyrosine kinase 2 [TYK2] / Janus Kinase 1 [JAK1] inhibitor; PF-06826647, a TYK2 inhibitor) in participants with moderate to severe HS. The study was designed to have a maximum duration of approximately 26 weeks, including an up to 6-week Screening Period, a 16-week Dosing Period and a 4-week Follow-up Period. The study was to enroll a total of approximately 192 participants (expected to provide approximately 156 completers). The study was placebo-controlled and double-blinded within each investigational product (IP) treatment arm, but not blinded across the PF-06650833, PF-06700841 and PF-06826647 treatment arms. Following the screening period, participants who met eligibility criteria at the baseline visit were to be randomly assigned to receive PF-06650833 (400 mg once daily [QD]) or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio, or PF-06700841(45 mg QD) or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio, or PF-06826647 (400 mg QD) or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio. For analysis, placebo groups were to be combined to yield final IP:placebo ratio of 1:1:1:1 for each IP and placebo. (TNF) responders. Participants were to be stratified according to whether they were an inadequate anti-TNF responder or not. Study Schema is presented in Figure S1. Figure S1. Study Design Schematic Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Participants were males or females who were 18 to 75 years (inclusive) of age at Screening with a body mass index (BMI) ≥17.5 kg/m2 and body weight ≥40 kg.

Efficacy Evaluations: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Percentage of participants with HiSCR response at Week 16. HiSCR response is a clinical endpoint to evaluate therapeutic outcomes in patients with HS, defined as at least a 50% reduction in the total AN count, and no increase in abscess count, and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Percentage of participants with HiSCR response at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. Percentage of participants with a total AN count of 0 or 1; 0, 1, or 2 at Week 16. Percent change from baseline in AN count at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16. Absolute score and percent change from baseline in IHS4 at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16. IHS4 measures the severity of HS with higher scores indicating greater severity of HS. Proportion of participants who experienced an HS flare, defined as at least a 25% increase in AN count with a minimum increase of 2 relative to Baseline, at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16. Proportion of participants achieving erythema score of 1 or 0 in all affected anatomic regions among participants who have an erythema score of 2 or more in at least 1 anatomic region at baseline. Erythema score measures the severity of erythema, with higher scores indicating worse erythema. Secondary PRO Endpoints: Percentage of participants with ≥30% reduction and ≥1 unit reduction from baseline in PGA Skin Pain numeric rating scale (NRS30) – at worst and on average, respectively, amongst participants with baseline NRS ≥3, at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16. The PGA Skin Pain NRS is a 2-item scale (worst skin pain and average skin pain) with higher scores indicating worse skin pain. Percent CFB in NRS, at worst and on average respectively, in participants who had baseline NRS ≥3, at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16. CFB in NRS, at worst and on average respectively, at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16. Absolute score and CFB at pre-specified time points in HS Symptom Items and DLQI total score. The HS Symptom Items include 5 single items that assess patient self-reported symptoms related to HS, with higher rating scores indicating worse symptom experience. The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire to measure the impact of skin disease on health-related quality of life over the last week, with higher scores indicating greater impact. Proportion of participants achieving a DLQI=0 or 1. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations: Blood samples were collected into appropriately labeled tubes containing K EDTA. Plasma 2 samples were analyzed for concentrations of PF-06650833 and metabolites, PF-06700841 and PF-06826647 using a validated analytical method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures (SOPs). Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs measurements, ECG assessments, and clinical safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: Efficacy Primary Efficacy Endpoint (HiSCR response at Week 16): The HiSCR response data comparing active treatment group and placebo group were analyzed using the Cochran Mantel Hanzel (CMH) test, adjusting for the stratification factor of prior anti-TNF failure status and concomitant use of antibiotics status. Treatment differences in HiSCR response and the corresponding 2-sided 80% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for the stratification factor were computed using the methods proposed by Cochran Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The binary secondary efficacy endpoint of proportion of participants with a total AN count of 0 or 1 at Week 16 was analyzed similar to the primary efficacy endpoint using CMH test comparing the treatment differences adjusting for the two stratification factors. Point estimates and CIs were provided similarly as well. Other binary secondary efficacy endpoints, using various definitions and at different time points, were analyzed similarly. The continuous secondary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in NRS at worst at Week 16 was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model which included terms for treatment group, the stratification factors (if there were sufficient number of participants in each stratum, otherwise the stratification factors were to be dropped from the model), and the baseline NRS. Other continuous secondary efficacy endpoints, using various definitions and at different time points, were analyzed similarly. PK PK concentrations were summarized and presented with descriptive statistics. Safety All safety data were summarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulations, descriptive statistics, categorical summaries, and graphical presentations in accordance with Pfizer Data Standards. RESULTS Unless otherwise specified, results presented in this Synopsis were based on data by Primary Completion Date (PCD). Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 194 participants were randomized to 4 treatment groups; 48 in the Placebo group, 47 in the PF‑06650833 group, 52 in the PF‑06700841 group, and 47 in the PF‑06826647 group. The majority of the participants (77.8%) were females. The overall mean age was 37.9 years. More than half of the participants (57.7%) were White, and 35.6% of the participants were Black. Among 194 randomized participants, 130 (67%) and 64 (33%) had Hurley Stage II (moderate) and Hurley Stage III (severe) HS lesions at baseline respectively, 43 participants (22.2%) had anti-TNF inadequate response at baseline, and 25 participants (12.9%) were on a background of concomitant oral antibiotic therapy. A total of 133 participants (68.6%) completed the Treatment Phase (Placebo group: 35 participants [72.9%]; PF-06650833 group: 30 participants [63.8%]; PF-06700841 group: 37 participants [71.2%]; PF-06826647 group: 31 participants [66.0%]). A total of 14 participants (7.2%) discontinued from study intervention due to AE. A total of 140 participants (72.2%) completed the Follow-up Phase (Placebo group: 37 participants [77.1%]; PF-06650833 group: 31 participants [66.0%]; PF-06700841 group: 40 participants [76.9%]; PF-06826647 group: 32 participants [68.1%]). A total of 8 participants (4.1%) discontinued from Follow-up Phase due to AE. One participant in the PF-06826647 group discontinued from both the Treatment Phase and the Follow-up Phase due to an SAE of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 4 participants had exposure during pregnancy (EDP) events, in which 2 participants in the Placebo group discontinued from the Treatment Phase due to pregnancy. Efficacy Results: Primary Efficacy Endpoint Results - HiSCR Response at Week 16 The PF-06700841 group met the pre-specified efficacy criteria for the primary endpoint, with clear separation from placebo in HiSCR response at Week 16. The stratified CMH test estimated the difference from placebo in HiSCR response rate (%) was 18.7 (one-sided p value = 0.0298, multiplicity adjusted one-sided p value = 0.0893) at Week 16, with 0 not included in the 90% CI (2.7, 34.6) (Table S3). The PF-06650833 group and the PF-06826647 group did not meet the pre-specified efficacy criteria for the primary endpoint, as no clear separation from placebo in HiSCR response at Week 16 were observed. The stratified CMH test estimated that the difference from placebo in HiSCR response rate (%) was 0.7 (multiplicity adjusted one-sided p value = 0.4696) for the PF-06650833 group with 0 included in the 90% CI (-15.2, 16.7), and 3.5 (multiplicity adjusted one-sided p value = 0.4696) for the PF-06826647 group with 0 included in the 90% CI (-12.6, 19.6) (Table S3). Across all treatment groups, participants with less severe disease at baseline (Hurley Stage II) had higher HiSCR response rates at Week 16 compared to participants who had more severe HS lesions at baseline (Hurley Stage III). Hurley Stage II participants in the PF-06700841 group had numerically higher HiSCR response rate (59.4%) at Week 16 than Hurley Stage III participants within the same treatment group (40.0%), as well as all the other subgroups stratified according to Hurley Stage (≤39.4% in the Placebo group, ≤38.2% in the PF-06650833 group, ≤38.7% in the PF-06826647 group).  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Results HiSCR Response at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 No statistical separation from placebo in HiSCR response was observed until Week 12 in the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group or the PF-06826647 group. Response Based on AN Count - Percentage of Participants With Total AN Count of 0 or 1, 0, 1 or 2 at Week 16 The PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group and PF-06826647 group had numerically higher percentage of participants who achieved a total AN count of 0 or 1, or a total AN count of 0, 1 or 2 at Week 16 compared to the Placebo group. The PF-06700841 group had statistically significantly higher percentage of participants who achieved a total AN count of 0, 1 or 2 at Week 16 compared to the Placebo group, whereas no significant improvement compared to Placebo was observed in the PF-06650833 group and the PF-06826647 group. Response Based on AN Count - Percent Change From Baseline in AN Count at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 Generally, no clear separation from placebo (Least Square Mean [LSM] difference from placebo) was observed in percent change from baseline in AN count across active treatment groups, except for the PF-06700841 group and the PF-06826647 group at Week 1, with 0 not included in the 90% CIs. Response Based on AN Count - Proportion of Participants Who Experienced an HS Flare (At Least a 25% Increase in AN Count With a Minimum Increase of 2 Relative to Baseline) at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 Statistically significant reduction in percentage of participants experiencing flare compared to the Placebo group was observed in the PF-06650833 group at Week 12, in the PF-06700841 group at Week 12 and Week 16, and in the PF-06826647 group at Weeks 8, 12 and 16. Numerically lower proportions of participants had experienced flare by Week 12 and Week 16 across the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group, and PF-06826647 group compared to the Placebo group. Statistically significantly larger reduction in cumulative percentage of participants who had experienced flare by Week 12 and Week 16 was observed in the PF-06700841 group compared to the Placebo group. Absolute Score and Percent Change From Baseline in IHS4 at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 No clear separation from placebo was observed in IHS4 absolute scores or percent changes from baseline in IHS4 across the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group and the PF-06826647 group. Proportion of Participants Achieving Erythema Response in All Affected Anatomic Regions Among Participants With Baseline Erythema Score of 2 or More in At Least 1 Anatomic Region During the course of the study (Week 1 to Week 16), the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group and PF-06826647 group generally had numerically higher proportion of participants who had erythema response compared to the Placebo Group. Separation from placebo in the proportion of participants with erythema response was observed in the PF-06650833 group (higher than Placebo at Week 6) and in the PF-06700841 group (higher than Placebo at Weeks 4, 12 and 16), with 0 not included in the 90% CIs. Secondary PRO Endpoint Results NRS - Percentage of Participants Achieving NRS30 (At Worst and On Average) Amongst Participants with Baseline NRS ≥3, at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 Generally, no clear separation from placebo was observed in percentage of participants achieving NRS30 in the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group or PF-06826647 group during this study. None of the compounds significantly differentiated from Placebo in NRS30 rate at Week 16. NRS - Percent Change From Baseline in NRS (At Worst and on Average) in Participants With Baseline NRS ≥3, at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 Generally, no clear separation from placebo was observed in percent change from baseline in PGA Skin Pain NRS in the PF-06650833 group or the PF-06826647 group up to Week 16.

Pharmacokinetic Results: PF-06650833 and Metabolites (PF-06787900 and PF-06787899) Concentrations The median pre-dose plasma concentrations of PF-06650833 and metabolites (PF-06787900 and PF-06787899) appear to achieve steady state by Week 1. Maximum mean plasma concentration was observed at 4-hour post-dose (112.4 ng/mL for PF-06650833, 61.82 ng/mL for PF-06787900, and 102.8 ng/mL for PF-06787899) when serial PK samples were collected up to 4 hours post-dose at Week 8. The geometric percent coefficient of variation (%CV) of plasma concentrations from pre-dose Week 1 up to Week 16 ranged between 51% and 117% for PF-06650833, between 46% and 105% for PF-06787900, and between 45% and 107% for PF-06787899. The observed median PF-06650833 plasma concentrations in this study were consistent with data from healthy participants or participants with rheumatoid arthritis. PF-06700841 Concentrations The median pre-dose plasma concentration of PF-06700841 appears to achieve steady state by Week 1. Maximum mean PF-06700841 plasma concentration was observed at 1-hour post-dose (373.4 ng/mL) when serial PK samples were collected up to 4 hours post-dose at Week 8. The geometric %CVs of plasma concentrations of PF-06700841 across all visits up to Week 16 ranged between 47% and 155%.

Safety Results: Secondary Safety Endpoints (AEs, Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities, Vital Signs, ECG, Physical Examination) TEAEs Among 194 randomized participants, 108 participants (55.7%) had 231 all-causality TEAEs, 45 participants (23.2%) had 71 treatment-related TEAEs. The total number and percentage of participants with all-causality TEAEs were numerically lower in the placebo group (23, 47.9%) compared to all 3 treatment groups (PF-06650833 [26, 55.3%], PF-06700841 [30, 57.7%] and PF-06826647 [29, 61.7%]). A similar pattern was observed for treatment-related TEAEs. No death occurred in this study. Four participants reported 4 SAEs, including 2 in the PF-06650833 group (1 treatment-related SAE of leading to discontinuation from the study; 1 SAE of cellulitis not related to study treatment) and 2 in the PF-06826647 group (1 treatment-related SAE of hidradenitis; 1 SAE of COVID-19, not related to study treatment, and leading to discontinuation from the study). Out of 231 all-causality TEAEs, 154 were mild, 68 were moderate, and 9 were severe. The number and percentage of participants with severe TEAEs were higher in the PF-06826647 group (4 [8.5%]) compared the other groups (Placebo: 1 [2.1%]; PF-06650833: 2 [4.3%]; PF-06700841 group: 1 [1.9%]). A total of 8 participants (4.1%) discontinued from the study due to TEAEs. The PF-06826647 group had higher number and proportion of participants who permanently discontinued from study (6 [12.8%]) or temporarily discontinued from study (5 [10.6%]) due to all-causality TEAEs compared to the other groups (Placebo group: 0, 2 [4.2%]; trends were observed in discontinuations from study due to treatment-related TEAEs. Two participants discontinued from the study due to SAEs, 1 in the PF-06650833 group (suicidal ideation) and 1 in the PF-06826647 group (COVID-19). One additional SAE of was reported in 1 participant in the PF-06650833 group after database release. Four participants had EDP events occurred in this study; 2 in the Placebo group (one participant discontinued) and 2 in the PF-06650833 group (one participant discontinued, one participant had a during follow-up, which after database release was updated to be a treatment-related SAE of No participant had herpes infections. Only 1 participant in the PF-06826647 group had a cardiovascular TEAE (deep vein thrombosis post-COVID-19) that met the adjudication criteria. The most frequently reported System Organ Classes (SOCs) for all-causality TEAEs (10% participants) were Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (20.1%), Infections and Infestations (18.0%), Investigations (11.3%) and Gastrointestinal Disorders (10.8%). The following SOCs had numerically higher number and percentage of participants with all-causality TEAEs in the active treatment group than in the Placebo group (SOCs with incidence of ≥5% in the active treatment group and/or the Placebo group are listed):  PF-06650833 group versus Placebo group: Infections and Infestations (13 participants, 27.7% vs 5 participants, 10.4%), Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (9, 19.1% vs 7, 14.6%), Gastrointestinal Disorders (7, 14.9% vs 4, 8.3%), Nervous System Disorders (6, 12.8% vs 3, 6.3%), Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications (4, 8.5% vs 2, 4.2%).  PF-06700841 group versus Placebo group: Infections and Infestations (12 participants, 23.1% vs 5 participants, 10.4%), Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (10, 19.2% vs 7, 14.6%), Investigations (7, 13.5% vs 2, 4.2%), Nervous System Disorders (6, 11.5% vs 3, 6.3%), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (5, 9.6% vs 3, 6.3%) and Psychiatric disorders (4, 7.7% vs 1, 2.1%).  PF-06826647 group versus Placebo group: Skin and Subcutaneous tissue Disorders (13 participants, 27.7% vs 5 participants, 10.4%), Investigations (11, 23.4% vs 2, 4.2%), Gastrointestinal Disorders (6, 12.8% vs 4, 8.3%), Blood and Lymphatic Disorders (4, 8.5% vs 1, 2.1%).

Laboratory The percentage of participants with abnormal laboratory results without regard to baseline abnormality were comparable across all groups. Overall in the study, the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities without regard to baseline abnormality (occurring in >20% of participants) included C-reactive protein >1.1 × upper limit of normal (ULN), urine protein ≥1 mg/dL, urine hemoglobin ≥1, and creatine kinase >2.0 × ULN. Overall in this study, 7 participants (3.6%) had laboratory test values that met discontinuation criteria, and 5 of these participants were in the PF-06826647 group. A total of 6 participants met the discontinuation criteria of absolute neutrophil value <1 × 103/mm3, and 3 of these participants discontinued from the study due to this abnormality. No participant met protocol-specified discontinuation criteria for hemoglobin, platelets, lymphocytes, concomitant reduction in serum creatinine and serum cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). No participants discontinued from the study due to liver function test data meeting discontinuation criteria. A total of 10 participants had TEAE of blood creatine phosphokinase increased, and none of them discontinued from the study due to this TEAE. Vital Signs No trends in vital signs (supine systolic blood pressure [BP], supine diastolic BP, pulse rate, body weight) were observed in the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group, and PF-06826647 group. The PF-06826647 group had higher proportion of participants who experienced an increase from baseline of ≥20 mmHg in supine diastolic BP or an increase from baseline of ≥30 mmHg in supine systolic BP compared with the Placebo group, PF-06650833 group and PF-06700841 group. ECG No abnormal AND clinically significant changes in ECG were observed in this study. No participant had QTcF interval ≥500 msec. One TEAE of electrocardiogram QT prolonged was reported by 1 participant in the Placebo group. This TEAE was mild and treatment-related. Physical Examination The majority of physical examination findings were observed on participant skin across all visits. Conclusion(s): Primary Endpoint – Efficacy Conclusion (HiSCR Response at Week 16) The PF-06700841 group met the pre-specified primary efficacy criteria, with clear separation from placebo in HiSCR response at Week 16. The PF-06650833 group and the PF-06826647 group did not meet the pre-specified primary efficacy criteria. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Conclusions Overall consistent and robust efficacy was observed for PF-06700841, whereas efficacy results were similar between PF-06650833 and PF-06826647 group and not significantly different from Placebo. No statistical separation from placebo in HiSCR response was observed by Week 12 in the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group, and PF-06826647 group. The PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group and PF-06826647 group had numerically higher percentage of participants who achieved a total AN count of 0 or 1, or a total AN count of 0, 1 or 2 at Week 16 compared to the Placebo group. The PF-06700841 group had statistically significantly higher percentage of participants who achieved a total AN count of 0, 1 or 2 at Week 16 compared to the Placebo group. No clear separation from placebo was observed in percent change from baseline in AN count across the active treatment groups, except for the PF-06700841 group and the PF-06826647 group at Week 1. Statistically significant reduction in percentage of participants experiencing flare compared to the Placebo group was observed in the PF-06650833 group at Week 12, in the PF-06700841 group at Week 12 and Week 16, and in the PF-06826647 group at Weeks 8, 12 and 16. Numerically lower proportions of participants had experienced flare by Week 12 and Week 16 across the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group, and PF-06826647 group compared to the Placebo group. Statistically significant reduction in cumulative HS flare rate (at least 1 flare) by Week 12 and Week 16 was observed in the PF-06700841 group compared to the Placebo group. No clear separation from placebo was observed in IHS4 absolute scores or percent changes from baseline in IHS4 across the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group, and PF-06826647 group. PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group, and PF-06826647 group generally had higher proportion of participants who had erythema response compared to Placebo group during the study. Separation from placebo in the proportion of participants with erythema response was observed in the PF-06650833 group at Week 6 and in the PF-06700841 group at Weeks 4, 12 and 16. Secondary PRO Endpoint Conclusions No clear separation from placebo was observed in percentage of participants achieving NRS30 at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 in the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group or PF-06826647 group during this study. No clear separation from placebo was observed in percent change from baseline or change from baseline in PGA Skin Pain NRS in the PF-06650833 group or the PF-06826647 group up to Week 16. A trend of larger decrease from baseline was observed in the PF-06700841 group compared to Placebo Group. No clear separation from placebo was observed in HS symptom items in the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group or PF-06826647 group up to Week 16. No clear separation from placebo was observed in HS DLQI total scores or proportion of participants achieving a DLQI of 0 or 1 in the PF-06650833 group, PF-06700841 group, or PF-06826647 group up to Week 16. Secondary PK Endpoint Conclusions Maximum mean plasma concentration was observed at 4-hour post-dose for PF-06650833 and metabolites (112.4 ng/mL for PF-06650833, 61.82 ng/mL for PF-06787900, and 102.8 ng/mL for PF-06787899) when serial PK samples were collected up to 4 hours post-dose at Week 8. Maximum mean PF-06700841 plasma concentration was observed at 1-hour post-dose (373.4 ng/mL) when serial PK samples were collected up to 4 hours post-dose at Week 8. Maximum mean PF-06826647 plasma concentration was observed at 2-hour post-dose (869.6 ng/mL) when serial PK samples were collected up to 4 hours post-dose at Week 8. The median plasma concentrations observed in this study were not significantly different from previous data from healthy participants or other patient populations. Secondary Safety Endpoint Conclusions PF-06700841, PF-06826647 and PF-06650833 appeared generally safe and well tolerated. The majority of the TEAEs reported were mild and moderate. A total of 4 participants experienced 4 SAEs by PCD: 2 SAEs each in the PF-06650833 and the PF-06826647 groups. One additional SAE of was reported in 1 participant in the PF-06650833 group after database release. There were no deaths or cases of herpes zoster/simplex in the study.
