Publications Based on the Study: None Study Initiation Date: 15 April 2016 Study Completion Date: 28 May 2019 Report Date: 24 October 2019 Previous Report Date(s): Not applicable Phase of Development: Phase 3 Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints: Study objectives and endpoints are presented in Table S1. Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints METHODS Study Design: This was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical study conducted in selected Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico). Upon marketing approval of palbociclib by the local health authorities in the participating countries, patients enrolled ended participation in this study and were moved to commercially available palbociclib (if considered to be appropriate by the investigator). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC) were enrolled in this study. The eligible patients had estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive tumor and were appropriate candidates for letrozole therapy. The patients had to have no prior treatment with any cyclin-dependent kinase(s) (CDK) inhibitor or previous participation in a palbociclib clinical study. Study Treatment: Palbociclib (supplied as capsules containing 75 mg, 100 mg, or 125 mg equivalents of palbociclib free base) was administered orally once a day at 125 mg/day for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment for each pre-defined 28-day cycle. The drug information is provided in Table S2. Letrozole (commercial supplies) was administered orally at 2.5 mg once daily as a continuous daily dosing schedule. Table S2.

The purpose of this Expanded Access Program (EAP) study was to provide access to palbociclib in the selected countries, and there were no primary efficacy endpoints defined for this study. Objective response rate (ORR) is summarized in as-treated (AT) population along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% exact confidence intervals (CIs) which are based on the binomial distribution. Descriptive statistics for the duration of clinical benefit (in weeks) are provided. Table S3. Efficacy Evaluations Evaluation Definition Primary Endpoint not applicable SecondaryORR The tumor response was based on the response reported by investigator per local practice. The best response was the best outcome the patient had out of all the tumor assessments during the study. No response confirmation was applied. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response or partial response relative to all as-treated population. Duration of Duration of clinical benefit is defined as the length of time patients remain on Clinical Benefit palbociclib treatment from the first day of treatment until the last day of treatment in this study. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, and/or Other Evaluations: No pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and/or other evaluations were done for this study. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), adverse events (AEs), physical examination and safety laboratory tests. Statistical Methods: For the continuous variable, descriptive statistics are summarized. For the categorical variables, the total patients count, number and percentage of patients in each category are provided. Time-to-event endpoints are summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically when appropriate. Median event times and 2-sided 95% CI for each median are provided. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: Patient disposition is summarized in Table S4. There were 131 patients who were enrolled and assigned to study treatment, and 130 were treated with palbociclib and letrozole. The AT population or safety analysis set (130 patients) included all patients who received at least 1 dose of palbociclib treatment. All of the treated patients were discontinued from study. The primary reasons for study discontinuations were not related to the study drug. The most frequent reasons were “study terminated by sponsor” (due to the study being ended by the sponsor when palbociclib became commercially available, as per the protocol plan) and “objective progression or relapse”.

One (1) patient from Mexico was randomized but did not receive the study treatment. All enrolled patients were female and their age ranged from 28 to 83 years. The patient demographic characteristics were similar across the participating countries. As required by the inclusion criteria, all patients had baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2. Efficacy Results: No primary efficacy analyses were conducted and therefore no results are available for this study. For the secondary efficacy results, the observed ORR was 24.8% (95% CI: 17.6, 33.2); and the median duration of clinical benefit was 10.6 months (range: 0.1 to 29.3 months). Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacogenomic, Immunogenicity and/or Other Results: No results are available for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenomics, immunogenicity and/or other evaluations applicable for this study. Safety Results: The median duration of palbociclib treatment was 11 treatment cycles (range: 1.0 to 31.0) with a median relative dose intensity of 90.9%. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) overviews are provided in Table S5 (all-causality) and Table S6 (palbociclib-related). Of the 130 patients who received at least 1 dose of the study drugs, 99.2% experienced all-causality TEAEs and 98.5% experienced palbociclib-related TEAEs. Thirty-two (32 [24.6%]) patients had treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) and 111 (85.4%) patients had Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs. Seven (7 [5.4%]) patients had a TEAE with a fatal outcome (Grade 5), none of which were considered palbociclib-related or letrozole-related. Table S5.

The most commonly reported all-causality TEAEs were Neutropenia (91 [70.0%] patients), Leukopenia (45 [34.6%] patients) and Anaemia (44 [33.8%] patients). Two (2) patients permanently discontinued from study treatment due to Neutropenia events. Neutropenia was mostly effectively managed by dose reduction or temporary discontinuations. The most common all-causality TEAE grade 3 was Neutropenia (71 [54.6%] patients), followed by Neutrophil count decreased (28 [21.5%] patients) and Leukopenia (23 [17.7%] patients). The most commonly reported palbociclib-related TEAEs were Neutropenia (91 [70.0%] patients), Leukopenia (45 [34.6%] patients) and Anaemia (37 [28.5%] patients). The majority of Neutropenia events reported during the study were attributed to the palbociclib treatment. The most commonly reported SAE was Neoplasm progression (7 [5.4%] patients), most of which were non-treatment-related. Sixteen (16 [12.3%]) patients had TEAEs that resulted in discontinuation from palbociclib, 14 (10.8%) patients had TEAEs that resulted in discontinuation from letrozole, and 8 (6.2%) patients had TEAEs that resulted in discontinuation from study. In addition to the TEAEs, 2 patients discontinued from study due to Breast cancer and Death, respectively, and both were attributed to disease under study. Five (5) patients died during the study through Day 28 day following the last administration of study drug (palbociclib). Seven (7) patients died after Day 28 following the last dose. The most common cause of death was disease under study. No patients died due to treatment-related TEAEs. The most frequently observed abnormality of hematology changes from baseline (<Grade 3) to post-dose (Grade 3) was neutrophils (absolute). There were 99 (76.15%) patients who had post-dose absolute neutrophil count (ANC) count <1000 cells/mm3, and the median (95% CI) time-to-first ANC count <1000 cells/mm3 was 4.1 (4.0, 6.0) weeks. Of the 99 patients, the majority (95 patients) had recovery of ANC to ≥1000 cells/mm3, and the median (95% CI) time-to-recovery was 1.2 (1.1, 1.9) weeks. No apparent effect of duration of palbociclib exposure or palbociclib dose was observed on the hemoglobin A1c (Hb1Ac) levels. No abnormal ECG results were observed. Conclusions:  The study met its primary objective of providing access to palbociclib for postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative ABC who were deemed appropriate for letrozole therapy in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.  The combination of palbociclib with letrozole administered to patients in this study observed an ORR of 24.8% (95% CI: 17.6, 33.2) with a median duration of the palbociclib treatment for 10.6 months (range: 0.1 to 29.3 months), which supported the treatment benefit.  The combination of palbociclib with letrozole was generally well tolerated. The observed AEs were consistent with the known safety profile of palbociclib when administered with letrozole.  The most commonly reported all-causality TEAEs were Neutropenia, Leukopenia and Anaemia.  The most commonly reported all-causality SAE was Neoplasm progression. Seven (7 [5.4%]) patients had Grade 5 TEAEs. No patients died due to treatment-related TEAEs. The most common cause of death was disease under study.
