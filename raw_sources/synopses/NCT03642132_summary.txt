SYNOPSIS Study Title: A Randomized, Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Avelumab in Combination With Chemotherapy Followed by Maintenance Therapy of Avelumab in Combination With the Poly (Adenosine Diphosphate [ADP]-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor Talazoparib in Patients With Previously Untreated Advanced Ovarian Cancer (JAVELIN Ovarian PARP 100) Study Number: B9991030 Regulatory Agency or Public Disclosure Identifier Number: United States (US) Investigational New Drug (IND) Number: 126174 European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT) Number: 2017-004456-30 ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT number): NCT03642132 Study Phase: 3 Name of Study Intervention: MSB0010718C (Avelumab) and MDV3800, BMN 673 (Talazoparib) Name of Sponsor/Company: Pfizer Inc. CSR Version and Report Date: Final CSR Version 1.0, 29 June 2022 Number of Study Center(s) and Investigator(s): A total of 79 participants were enrolled at 30 sites in 10 countries/regions. A list of study centers and investigators involved in this study is provided in Appendix 16.1.4.1. Publications: None. Study Period: Study initiation date (First Participant First Vist): 19 Jul 2018 Study Completion Date (Last Participant Last Visit): 22 Dec 2021 On 19 March 2019, a Dear Investigator Letter was issued to notify the investigational sites that no new participants could be screened or randomized. Rationale: This study was designed to demonstrate that avelumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by avelumab plus talazoparib maintenance is superior to platinum-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab maintenance in prolonging progression free survival (PFS) in participants with advanced ovarian cancer with defects in DNA damage repair (DDR). On 21 December 2018, the sponsor announced that a related study (the Phase 3 JAVELIN Ovarian 100 study [B9991010]) was stopped due to futility of efficacy at a planned interim analysis. Although the overall safety profile of avelumab remained unchanged, the lack of efficacy with avelumab in the treatment of frontline ovarian cancer observed in study B9991010 reduced the probability of technical success of study B9991030. Therefore, the sponsor made the decision to stop enrollment in the B9991030 study. On 19 March 2019, a Dear Investigator Letter was issued to notify the investigational sites that no new participants could be screened or randomized.

The vital signs and ECGs were not analysed in this CSR as no data was recorded. Methodology: This was a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab in combination with chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy of avelumab in combination with the PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, in participants with previously untreated advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. The study design, including the number of participants to be randomized in each treatment arm, is illustrated in Figure S1. Originally about 720 participants (including 360 participants with tumors that are DDR+) be randomized in a 2.5:1:2.5 ratio stratified by germline breast cancer gene (gBRCA) 1/2 mutational status (gBRCA+ vs gBRCA-) and resection status (adjuvant with >1 mm and 1 cm residual disease vs adjuvant with >1 cm residual disease vs neoadjuvant) to one of the following treatment arms:  Arm A: platinum-based chemotherapy + avelumab followed by avelumab + talazoparib maintenance;  Arm B: platinum-based chemotherapy followed by talazoparib maintenance;  Arm C: platinum-based chemotherapy + bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab maintenance. Due to the early termination of the study by the sponsor as previously described, no new participants could be screened or randomized as of 19 March 2019. 79 participants were randomized in total, and 76 participants were treated across 3 treatment arms. Given the limited number of participants randomized prior to study stop, no statistical hypotheses were tested. Participant characteristics, treatment duration and safety endpoints were summarized by the treatment arm. Intravenous carboplatin and paclitaxel every 3 weeks were used as the platinum-based chemotherapy backbone. Participants were enrolled either following primary debulking surgery, or prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For participants who were enrolled prior to neoadjuvant therapy, the first 3 cycles would be administered prior to interval debulking surgery, and upon recovery from surgery, the remainder of chemotherapy would be administered after surgery. Figure S1. Study Schematic N = number of participants. With the last participant last visit on 22 Dec 2021 and the last case report form (CRF) data entry on 26 Jan 2022, the final database released (lock) for this CSR was on 10 Feb 2022. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): As of 19 March 2019, the sponsor made the decision to stop enrollment/randomization in study B9991030. Participants who were randomized could continue treatment as assigned and were to be monitored for appropriate safety assessments until treatment discontinuation. A total of 79 participants were randomized, and 76 participants were treated (including 29 participants in Arm A, 13 participants in Arm B, and 34 participants in Arm C). The full analysis set included 79 participants, including 76 participants in the safety analysis set, 29 participants in the avelumab PK analysis set, 24 participants in the talazoparib PK analysis set, and 29 participants in the avelumab immunogenicity analysis set. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Female participants with histologically confirmed Stage III-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, including carcinosarcoma with high-grade serous component, with age 18 years (or 20 years in Japan). Participants must be candidates for bevacizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and previously untreated. Participants must have completed a primary surgical debulking procedure, or be candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy with planned interval debulking surgery. Participants with any of the following characteristics/conditions would not be included in the study: non-epithelial tumors or ovarian tumors with low malignant potential (ie, borderline prior exposure to immunotherapy with interleukin (IL)-2, interferon alpha (IFN-α), or an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) antibody (including ipilimumab), or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways, excluding therapeutic anticancer vaccines. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration and Batch Numbers: For this study, the investigational products were avelumab and talazoparib. Bevacizumab was considered an investigational product only in countries where a treatment used in the standard therapy arm to be deemed an investigational product is required by law. The study included 2 treatment periods, the chemotherapy period and the maintenance period. For the chemotherapy period of the study, study drugs were planned to be given as follows: Arm A:  Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours followed by Carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 IV over 15-60 minutes on Days 1 of each 3-week cycle for 6 cycles.  Avelumab 800 mg administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for 6 cycles. On dosing days when both chemotherapy and avelumab were infused (Day 1), avelumab would be infused after chemotherapy. Arm B:  Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours followed by Carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 IV over 15-60 minutes on Days 1 of each 3-week cycle for 6 cycles. Arm C:  Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours followed by Carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 IV over 156-0 minutes on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for 6 cycles.  Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV Day 1 of each 3-week cycle beginning with Cycle 2 for adjuvant participants, and for neoadjuvant participants, bevacizumab would be given on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for Cycles 1, 2, 5, and 6. Maintenance period should begin within 4 weeks of the last dose of chemotherapy. The first visit of maintenance therapy would be designated maintenance Cycle 1 Day 1 even if the last chemotherapy cycle was not completed. For the maintenance period of the study, study drugs would be given as follows. Arm A:  Avelumab 800 mg administered intravenously on Days 1, 15 and 29 of each 6-week cycle in combination with talazoparib 0.75 mg self-administered orally once per day. On dosing days when both investigational products were administered, talazoparib would be administered first. Arm B:  Talazoparib 0.75 mg self-administered orally once a day, every day of each 6-week cycle. Arm C:  Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg administered intravenously on Days 1 and 22 of each 6-week cycle. Qualified participants were randomized in a 2.5:1:2.5 ratio as follows: The study drug information is provided in Table S1 Table S1.

Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: All the demographic characteristics were generally balanced across 3 treatment arms. The majority of participants were White and enrolled from North America. The mean (SD) age was 61.7 (10.93) years, ranging from 32 to 84 years. Exposure: The median durations of the exposure to paclitaxel were 18.1, 18.0 and 19.5 weeks in Arm A to C, to carboplatin with 18.1, 18.0 and 20.0 in Arm A to C, to bevacizumab with 17.8 in chemotherapy period and 45.0 in maintenance period, and to talazoparib with 33.1 and 32.0 in Arm A and B. Efficacy Results: The efficacy analyses were not completed given the low enrollment (11%) prior to study discontinuation. Safety Results: All 76 treated participants experienced all-causality treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (Table S2). Twenty-seven (93.1%) participants in Arm A (platinum-based chemotherapy + avelumab followed by avelumab + talazoparib maintenance), 12 (92.3%) participants in Arm B (platinum-based chemotherapy followed by talazoparib maintenance), and 34 (100%) of participants in Arm C (platinum-based chemotherapy + bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab maintenance) experienced treatment-related TEAEs. The proportion of participants with TEAEs leading to discontinuation of any study drug was greater in Arm B (30.8%) as compared to Arm A (13.8%) and Arm C (11.8%). No participant experienced TEAEs leading to death. interruption of Carboplatin TEAEs leading to death The most frequently reported all grades TEAEs were fatigue (48.3%) in Arm A, alopecia (53.8%) in Arm B, anaemia (41.2%), nausea (41.2%), and neutropenia (41.2%) in Arm C. The most common Grade ≥3 TEAE in each treatment group was neutropenia (34.5% in Arm A, 38.5% in Arm B, and 29.4% in Arm C). The most frequently reported all grades treatment-related TEAEs were anaemia (41.4%) in Arm A, alopecia (53.8%) in Arm B, and neutropenia (38.2%) in Arm C. The most common Grade ≥3 treatment-related TEAEs in each treatment group was neutropenia (31.0% in Arm A, 30.8% in Arm B, and 29.4% in Arm C). Of the 29 participants in Arm A, 2 participants died, and both were due to disease progression. Of the 34 participants in Arm C, 2 participants died, and both were due to disease progression. None of the deaths were considered as related to study treatment toxicity. No deaths occurred in Arm B or within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. Nine (31.0%) participants in Arm A, 4 (30.8%) participants in Arm B, and 15 (44.1%) participants in Arm C, experienced all-causality serious TEAEs. Most of these TEAEs were reported in 1 or 2 participants in that treatment group. One participant in Arm A, 1 participant in Arm B, and 8 participants in Arm C experienced treatment-related serious TEAEs. Four (13.8%) participants in Arm A, 4 (30.8%) participants in Arm B, and 4 (11.8%) participants in Arm C, experienced all-causality TEAEs leading to discontinuation of any study drug. Pharmacokinetic Results: Avelumab Pharmacokinetics Data from the 29 participants in Arm A who were administered a 1-hour IV infusion of avelumab 800 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy (chemotherapy period) followed by avelumab 800 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) in combination with talazoparib (maintenance period), were analyzed for serum avelumab concentrations. Avelumab predose concentration(s)/ concentration(s) at the end of the dosing interval (C ) were relatively low, and accumulation was minimal in the chemotherapy period trough (median range of 4.4 to 10.0 µg/mL), which is consistent with Q3W dosing of avelumab, given its estimated half-life of 6.1 days. Median avelumab C were higher in the trough maintenance period, ranging from 41.6 µg/mL on Day 29 of Cycle 1 to 28.6 µg/mL on Day 1 of Cycle 4, and were consistent with expected C following avelumab 800 mg Q2W trough monotherapy. Median maximum concentration(s) (C ) were relatively similar across max chemotherapy and maintenance periods, with median values ranging from 218 µg/mL in Cycle 1 Day 1 of the chemotherapy period to 279 µg/mL in Cycle 1 Day 29 of the maintenance period. Talazoparib Pharmacokinetics Talazoparib pre-dose concentrations were collected in Cycle 1 of the maintenance period in 24 participants: 16 in Arm A and 8 in Arm B. However, only a limited number of samples met the pre-specified criteria required for inclusion in the summary statistics. For Arm A, only 2 samples met the criteria on Day 15 and 3 on Day 29, while no samples met the criteria in Arm B. Following administration of 0.75 mg talazoparib in combination with 800 mg avelumab Q3W infusion in the maintenance period, the median talazoparib Ctrough concentration was 2500 pg/mL on Day 29 of Cycle 1. Immunogenicity Results: Immunogenicity data were analyzed in all 29 participants in Arm A, with results pooled across both chemotherapy and maintenance periods. Of the 29 participants with at least 1 valid ADA result at any time point, 17 (58.6%) were ADA never-positive. Of the 12 (41.4%) ADA ever positive participants, 3 were baseline ADA positive, of which 2 participants had a treatment-boosted response. Of the 9 (34.6%) participants with treatment-induced ADA, 6 had transient response and 3 had persistent response. Conclusions: Efficacy  The efficacy analyses were not completed so no efficacy conclusion was drawn. Safety  Based on review of the 76 participants dosed in the safety analysis set, there were no new clinically significant safety issues or concerns identified. There were no new safety signals for avelumab or talazoparib. PK  Coadministration of avelumab 800 mg Q3W with platinum-based chemotherapy in the Chemotherapy period and Q2W with talazoparib in the Maintenance period of Arm A resulted in avelumab C and C concentrations that were consistent with max trough those expected following avelumab monotherapy at this dose level and dosing frequency. Immunogenicity  The observed incidence of treatment-induced ADA response to avelumab was 34.6%.
