Model-informed design of multiple-dose bioequivalence and food-effect study in cancer patients. In: 2021 ACCP Virtual Annual Meeting; 13-17 Sept 2021; Online. 2021: poster #005. Study Period: Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 21 December 2020 Primary Completion Date (PCD): 04 February 2022 This study was neither discontinued nor interrupted. Rationale: In order to facilitate greater flexibility in batch size production, a proposed talazoparib liquid-filled soft gelatin capsule (hereafter referred as “soft gel capsule”) formulation was developed. This bioequivalence (BE) study was conducted to support the bridging of the current commercial capsule with the proposed talazoparib soft gel capsule formulation, and to explore the potential food-effect on the pharmacokinetic (PK) of the proposed talazoparib soft gel capsule formulation. Objectives, Endpoints, and Statistical Methods: Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 24 0 to 24 hours post-dose; AUC = area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 to the last time of the last quantifiable concentration; BE = bioequivalence; CL/F = apparent clearance after oral dose; C = maximum observed plasma concentration; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for max Adverse Events; C = predose plasma drug concentration; NCI = National Cancer Institute; trough T = time for C . max max BE of PK parameters was determined by constructing 90% confidence intervals (CIs) around the estimated difference between the Test and Reference treatments using a mixed effects model based on natural log transformed data. The mixed effects model was implemented using SAS Proc Mixed, with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation method and Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom algorithm. The PK parameter population is defined as all PK-evaluable participants randomized and treated who have a primary PK parameter of AUC or C in at least 1 treatment period 24 max where PK evaluable criteria were met. The safety analysis set included all participants randomly assigned to investigational product (IP) and who take at least 1 dose of IP. Participants were analyzed according to the product they actually received. Methodology: This was a Phase 1, open label, 2-sequence, crossover study to establish the BE of the current commercial formulation (powder filled hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose [HPMC] capsules) to the proposed talazoparib soft gelatin capsule formulation after multiple dosing under fasting conditions in participants with advanced solid tumors, and to evaluate food effect on the PK of the proposed talazoparib soft gelatin capsule formulation. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 sequences to receive Treatments A, B and C in different order as shown below (Table S1). The first 2 periods were for BE assessment, with Period 1 being 28 days and Period 2 being 21 days. Period 3 was a 21-day period to evaluate the food-effect on the PK of the proposed talazoparib soft gel capsule formulation (for participants who can tolerate one high-fat/high-calorie meal). Participants who received 21 consecutive days of continuous 1 mg once daily (QD) drug administration were considered as completers of a treatment period, before moving on to the next scheduled treatment. When dose interruptions or missed doses occur, participants repeated a treatment period for 21 days up to 2 additional times in order to qualify as completers. Participants who had repeated a period 2 times but still could not meet PK evaluable criteria, needed a dose reduction, had unstable renal function, had experienced renal function worsening to moderate/severe renal impairment during the study, or had completed the food-effect assessment, either ended study or were rolled over to the maintenance phase which consisted of repeating 28-day cycles of treatment with the current commercial formulation. After the last dose of talazoparib, participants entered a 28-day safety follow-up phase. This study was planned to enroll approximately 46 participants (23 per sequence) to ensure at least 22 PK-evaluable participants for the BE phase and at least 12 after the food-effect evaluation phase. Initial number of 46 participants was planned to be estimated based on 52% non-evaluable rate and was adjusted during enrollment if non-evaluable rate changes. When approximately 12 PK-evaluable participants completed both Periods 1 and 2, assumptions (AUC variability and point estimate) for power/sample size calculation were 24 reassessed. The sample size was allowed to be increased based on this PCD CSR; however, the total number of participants to be enrolled in the study was not to exceed 88 participants. A sensitivity analysis was retrospectively performed that used adjusted 90% CI derived based the Cui-Hung-Wang (CHW) statistic to assess the effect of the interim analysis on the type I error of the final analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical models. This is a PCD CSR with all safety data through the time of data cutoff. Table S1. Treatment Sequences Treatment A: current commercial talazoparib formulation 1 mg QD given under fasted conditions (reference for BE evaluation) Treatment B: the proposed talazoparib soft gelatin capsule formulation 1 mg QD given under fasted conditions (test for BE evaluation, reference for food-effect evaluation) Treatment C: the proposed talazoparib soft gelatin capsule formulation 1 mg QD given with food (on the PK sampling day, high-fat/high-calorie meal will be administered in the clinical sites prior to the administration of the proposed talazoparib soft gelatin capsule formulation; test for food-effect evaluation) Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): Approximately 46 participants (23 per sequence) to ensure at least 22 PK-evaluable participants for the BE phase and at least 12 after the food-effect evaluation phase. Initial number of 46 participants was planned to be estimated based on 52% non-evaluable rate and was adjusted during enrollment if non-evaluable rate changes. A total of 73 participants were assigned to the study treatment, among them, 35 were assigned to Sequence 1 and 38 were assigned to Sequence 2. All treated participants (73 participants) were included in the safety analysis set. A total of 53 participants who had a primary PK parameter of AUC or C in at least 1 24 max treatment period where PK evaluable criteria were met were included in the PK-evaluable population. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Participants aged from 18 to 70 years with advanced solid tumors were planned to be enrolled in this study. Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s): For this study, study intervention refers to soft gel capsule formulation of talazoparib and Talzenna®, the term IP may be used synonymously with study intervention. BE and Food-Effect Phases In Periods 1 and 2, participants took either the current commercial talazoparib capsule conditions (Table S1). In Period 3, participants took the proposed talazoparib soft gel capsule formulation under fed conditions. Maintenance Phase Participants continued the same dosage as the last dose from the BE and/or food-effect phase, whichever was later, with the commercial formulation or administered a lower dose due to adverse events. There were no dietary or lifestyle restrictions during the maintenance phase. IP might have been taken with or without food.

Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Hematology The 2 most frequent hematology abnormalities during treatment of commercial capsule (administered under fasted conditions), soft gel capsule (administered under fasted conditions), and food-effect phase were lymphocytes (103/mm3) <0.8 × lower limit of normal (LLN) and hemoglobin (g/dL) <0.8 × LLN. The 2 most frequent hematology abnormalities during the maintenance phase were lymphocytes (103/mm3) <0.8 × LLN and erythrocytes (106/mm3) <0.8 × LLN. No chemistry abnormalities occurred in ≥10% participants during the treatment of commercial capsule (administered under fasted conditions) or the soft gel capsule (administered under fasted conditions). Other Safety Evaluations No clinically meaningful findings were observed for electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters or physical measurements. Pharmacokinetic Results: Following oral administration of 1 mg talazoparib soft gel capsule under fasted conditions, median T was achieved earlier compared to median T following administration of the max max current commercial capsule, 0.975 hours (range: 0.417 to 4.00) vs 2.00 hours (range: 0.500 to 6.00), respectively. Geometric mean C was higher for the soft gel capsule compared to the max current commercial capsule under fasted conditions, 19.19 ng/mL vs 14.95 ng/mL, respectively. Geometric mean AUC were similar for the soft gel capsule compared to the 24 current commercial capsule under fasted conditions, 173.0 ng•hr/mL vs 178.7 ng•hr/mL, respectively. The Test/Reference ratios (90% CIs) of adjusted geometric mean talazoparib AUC and 24 C values for the soft gel capsule compared to the current commercial capsule were max 105.16% (99.00%, 111.70%) and 136.62% (125.05%, 149.27%), respectively. The 90% CI for the adjusted geometric mean ratio of AUC was contained within the BE limits of 80% 24 to 125%. The 90% CI for the adjusted geometric mean ratio of C was not contained within max the 80% to 125% interval. A sensitivity analysis that used adjusted 90% CI derived based the CHW statistic showed no effect of inflated type I error on the generated 90% CI. Variability in talazoparib exposure was comparable for the soft gel capsule formulation and the current commercial capsule administered under fasted conditions based on geometric CV% for AUC and C ranging from 32% to 40%. 24 max Following oral administration of 1 mg talazoparib soft gel capsule under fed conditions, median T was delayed compared to median T under fasted conditions, 4.00 hours max max (range: 0.967 to 24.7) vs 0.975 hours (range: 0.417 to 4.00), respectively. Geometric mean C was lower for the soft gel capsule administered under fed conditions relative to fasted max conditions, 11.36 ng/mL vs 19.19 ng/mL, respectively. Geometric mean AUC were 24 comparable for the soft gel capsule under fed and fasted conditions, 151.3 ng•hr/mL vs 173.0 ng•hr/mL, respectively. The Test/Reference ratios (90% CIs) of adjusted geometric mean talazoparib AUC and 24 C values for the soft gelatin capsule formulation administered under fed conditions max compared to fasted conditions were 87.97% (81.82%, 94.58%) and 58.26% (51.55%, 65.84%), respectively. The 90% CI for the adjusted geometric mean ratio of AUC was 24 contained within the BE limits of 80% to 125%. The 90% CI for the adjusted geometric Variability in total talazoparib exposure was comparable when the soft gel capsule was administered under fasted and fed conditions based on geometric CV% for AUC and C 24 max ranging from 32% to 38%, respectively. Conclusions: PK  The talazoparib soft gel capsule is equivalent to the current commercial capsule with regards to total daily steady state exposures, as the 90% CI of the geometric mean ratios of talazoparib AUC at steady state fell within the BE limits of 80% to 125%. The 24 adjusted geometric mean ratio was 105.16% (90% CI: 99.00%, 111.70%).  Talazoparib steady-state C was approximately 37% higher for the proposed soft gel max capsule formulation compared to the current commercial capsule of talazoparib when both were administered under fasted conditions. The adjusted geometric mean ratio was 136.62% (90% CI: 125.05%, 149.27%).  Daily administration of the talazoparib soft gel capsule formulation under fed conditions did not affect talazoparib total exposure (AUC ) relative to administration under fasted 24 conditions, as the 90% CI of the geometric mean ratio of talazoparib steady-state AUC24 fell within the BE limits of 80% to 125%. The adjusted geometric mean ratio was 87.97% (90% CI: 81.82%, 94.58%). However, administration of talazoparib under fed conditions decreased talazoparib steady-state C by approximately 42% compared to the max administration of talazoparib under fasted conditions. The adjusted geometric mean ratio was 58.26% (90% CI: 51.55%, 65.84%). Safety  Talazoparib soft gel capsule formulation had a safety profile that was tolerable and managed by dosing interruptions, dose reductions and/or standard medical therapy. The TEAEs were generally consistent with the known safety profile of talazoparib. No new safety signals were identified.
