Table S1. Study Objectives and Endpoints – Part 1 Dose Escalation Table S2. Study Objectives and Endpoints – Part 2 Dose Expansion METHODS Study Design: This was a first-in-patient (FIP), Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, multiple-dose, dose escalation and expansion, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic study of sasanlimab in previously treated participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor types with clinical evidence of response to anti programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) agents. This clinical trial included 2 parts: Part 1 dose escalation and Part 2 dose expansion (Figure S1). A total of approximately 140 participants were planned to be enrolled into this study. Figure S1. Study Schematic Part 1 enrolled participants with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma, squamous cell cancer of head and neck (SCCHN), ovarian cancer, sarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma (UC), or other solid tumor types with clinical evidence of response to anti PD-1 or PD-L1 agents. Participants received sasanlimab doses at 0.5, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W), or sasanlimab 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) every 4 weeks (Q4W). Part 1 was further divided into Part 1A (safety cohort) and Part 1B (pharmacodynamic cohort). For both IV and SC administration portions, each safety cohort enrolled 2 to 4 participants per dose level. For IV administration portion, each pharmacodynamic cohort enrolled 2 to 5 participants per dose level. For SC administration portion, up to approximately 11 participants were enrolled into the 300 mg dose level in Part 1B. Approximately 40 participants were planned to be enrolled into Part 1. All participants in Part 2 received sasanlimab 300 mg SC Q4W. Part 2 dose expansion included 2 arms: Arm 1 was to enroll approximately 70 participants with NSCLC who progressed on or were intolerant to systemic therapy or for whom systemic therapy was refused or unavailable but had not previously received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. Arm 2 was to enroll approximately 30 participants with UC who progressed on or were intolerant to previously received anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. Approximately 100 participants were planned to be enrolled into Part 2. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Part 1 Dose Escalation Male or female participants (age ≥18 years) with histological or cytological diagnosis of locally advanced metastatic melanoma, SCCHN, ovarian cancer, sarcoma, NSCLC, or UC were enrolled. At least 1 measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1. Part 2 Dose Expansion Male or female participants (age ≥18 years) with either histological or cytological diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC or locally advanced or metastatic UC who had progressed on or were intolerant to standard of care systemic therapy, or for whom standard of care systemic therapy was refused or unavailable were enrolled. At least 1 measurable lesion as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Study Treatment: IV Administration (Part 1 Only) Sasanlimab was administered IV, with adjustment for body weight at every cycle. In each cycle, participants were weighed within 72 hours prior to dosing to ensure they did not experience weight loss/gain of >10% from the prior weight used for sasanlimab dose preparation calculations. Sasanlimab was administered on an outpatient basis as an IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle, initially over 60 minutes ± 10 minutes. The use of an infusion pump was the preferred method of administration to ensure accurate delivery of the investigational product, but gravity drips were allowed. A cycle was defined as the time from Day 1 dose to the next Day 1 dose. If there were no treatment delays, IV administration cycles were 21 days (±2 days). Each participant might receive sasanlimab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination. The dose level for Part 1 was assigned by the sponsor. SC Administration (Parts 1 and 2) Qualified and trained investigator site personnel administered sasanlimab at a fixed dose of 300 mg to participants by SC injection to the abdomen. A total volume of 6 mL was administered SC for a dose of 300 mg of sasanlimab. Ideally, 3 SC injections of 2 mL were administered to the abdomen, although, more injections could be done as needed, in order to Study drug was administered to 2 or more different quadrants of the abdomen (with preference given to the lower quadrants when possible); 1 or 2 injections per quadrant. The maximum number of injections per participant was 8 injections. Similar to IV dosing, a cycle was defined as the time from Day 1 dose to the next Day 1 dose. Participants received a single dose of sasanlimab on Day 1 of each cycle. If there were no treatment delays, a cycle was 28 days (±2 days) for SC administration. Each participant might receive sasanlimab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, participant no longer willing to participate in trial, or study termination. Study drug information is provided in Table S3. Efficacy Evaluations: Anti-tumor activity was a secondary objective for the dose escalation cohort and was both primary and secondary objectives for the expansion cohort. Tumor assessments included all known or suspected disease sites. Anti-tumor activity was assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline, during treatment, whenever disease progression was suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the time of withdrawal from treatment. Note: If a participant was classified as having progressive disease during an on-treatment tumor assessment, then confirmation of progressive disease by a second scan in the absence of rapid clinical deterioration was required per immune-related RECIST (irRECIST). Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were done every 6 weeks (5 days) for participants on IV administration portion and every 8 weeks (5 days) for Parts 1 and 2 SC administration portion from the start of study entry (defined as Cycle 1 Day 1 [C1D1]) until disease progression by irRECIST, death, withdraw consent, or subsequent administration of an anti-chemotherapy agent. CT or MRI scans might be assessed every 12 weeks (±5 days) for participants who (1) had remained on treatment for (3) had demonstrated stability of disease. Tumor assessments were fixed according to the calendar, regardless of treatment delays. Disease response assessments were based upon disease-specific response criteria: RECIST version 1.1 and irRECIST. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Immunogenicity Evaluations: Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Blood samples (approximate 5 mL) to provide serum for the analysis of sasanlimab concentrations were collected per sample collection timepoint. Sasanlimab concentrations in serum were measured using a validated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method. The serum sasanlimab PK parameters were estimated using noncompartmental analysis of concentration-time data for adult participants with advanced solid tumors enrolled in Part 1. Samples below the lower limit of quantitation were set to zero for the PK analysis. Actual sample collection times were used for the PK analysis when available, otherwise nominal times postdose were used. The predose (0 hour) samples for Cycle 2 and Cycle 5 were included in the PK analysis using actual collection times relative to the Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 doses, respectively. However, in the Cycle 4 PK analysis for the IV doses, the predose sample for Cycle 6 was used in lieu of Cycle 5 predose PK samples as tau, where tau = the nominal time of 504 hours after the Cycle 4 dose. Pharmacodynamic Evaluation Biopsies and tissue samples (including but not limited to tumor, peripheral blood, and plasma) were collected before and after sasanlimab dosing for biomarker evaluation and pharmacodynamic assessments. Immune cell phenotypes and PD-1 receptor occupancy (RO) on T-cell subsets were evaluated in whole blood by flow cytometry in Part 1 only. Immunogenicity Evaluations Blood samples (approximately 10 mL) to provide serum for detection of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against sasanlimab were collected. The ADA samples were analyzed using a validated ECL method in compliance with the sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs). The sample analysis followed a tiered approach of screening, confirmation, and titer determination. Samples tested positive for ADA were further analyzed for NAb using a cell-based assay in compliance with the sponsor’s SOPs. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) monitoring, clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, single 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examinations, pregnancy testing or postmenopausal status, Statistical Methods: Efficacy Objective response (OR), as assessed using RECIST version 1.1 and irRECIST, was a primary efficacy endpoint for Part 2. The following analyses were performed in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population by tumor type (NSCLC or UC) and pooled: 1. Objective response rate (ORR) by visit, separately for RECIST version 1.1 and irRECIST: investigator provided tumor response complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and CR+PR were presented by descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 2. Best overall response (BOR) of CR, PR, and CR+PR, separately for RECIST version 1.1 and irRECIST. This included BOR derivation without confirmation and with confirmation. Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) and 95% CI were provided. Except OR for Part 2, efficacy was a secondary objective. The efficacy analysis was performed in the mITT population. Part 1 and Part 2 data were summarized separately and might also be pooled together for analysis if deemed necessary. Efficacy data assessed by RECIST were analyzed separately from those assessed by irRECIST. Summary tables of BOR rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of stable disease (DOSD), and duration of response (DOR) might be provided by the groups aforementioned when deemed necessary. Pharmacokinetics The concentration-time data of sasanlimab were summarized by descriptive statistics (n, mean, and standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, minimum, maximum, and geometric mean) according to dosing cohort and time for each part of the study. In addition, the concentration-time data from Part 2 were also summarized by descriptive statistics according to tumor type. Pharmacodynamics Descriptive statistics of PD-1 RO by sasanlimab evaluated from the percentage of free (ie, unbound) PD-1 on the surface of circulating T cells was summarized by overall, tumor type, and dose within tumor type as data permitted. Immunogenicity Summary of number of participants and incidence of developed ADA against sasanlimab was tabulated by dose level cohort. For participants with positive ADA or NAb, the magnitude (titer), time of onset, and duration of ADA or NAb response were also described, if data permitted. Safety Summaries and analyses of safety parameters included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Sasanlimab safety data were evaluated using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Participant Disposition and Demography: A total of 147 participants were enrolled in the study, of which, 146 participants were treated with sasanlimab. For Part 1 (dose escalation) of the trial, a total of 40 participants were treated at dose levels of 0.5, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg IV Q3W (25 participants) or 300 mg SC Q4W (15 participants). For Part 2 (dose expansion) of the trial, a total of 107 participants were enrolled; 68 participants with NSCLC and 39 participants with UC, of whom, 106 participants in Part 2 received sasanlimab 300 mg SC Q4W. One participant from the UC cohort was enrolled in the study but not dosed. In Part 1, among the 40 participants treated with sasanlimab, 39 participants discontinued from the treatment, and 1 participant from the 3 mg/kg IV dose cohort completed the treatment (ie, participants received the study treatment for approximately 2 years after Cycle 1 Day 1). Objective progression or relapse was the most commonly reported reason for discontinuations from the treatment (25 [62.5%] participants) (Table S4). Among the 40 participants treated with sasanlimab, 34 participants discontinued from the study, and 6 participants completed the study. The main reason for discontinuations from the study was death (27 [67.5%] participants) (Table S5). In Part 2, among the 106 participants treated with sasanlimab, 96 participants discontinued from the treatment, and 10 participants completed the treatment. Objective progression or relapse was the most commonly reported reason for discontinuations from the treatment (42 [39.6%] participants) (Table S4). Among the 106 participants treated with sasanlimab, 91 participants discontinued from the study, and 15 participants completed the study. The main reason for discontinuations from the study was death (53 [50.0%] participants) (Table S5).

Duration of Stable Disease Part 1 (Secondary Endpoint) There were 13 participants and 18 participants with BOR of SD in Part 1 based on RECIST version 1.1 and irRECIST, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOSD based on RECIST version 1.1 and irRECIST in Part 1 was 7.3 months (95% CI: 3.8, 13.8) and 13.7 months (95% CI: 4.6, 37.9), respectively. Part 2 (Secondary Endpoint) In Part 2, there were 24 participants and 12 participants with BOR of SD based on RECIST version 1.1 in the NSCLC cohort and UC cohort, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOSD based on RECIST version 1.1 was 6.5 months (95% CI: 3.7, 10.1) and 8.5 months (95% CI: 3.7, NE) for the NSCLC cohort and UC cohort, respectively. There were 31 participants and 17 participants with BOR of SD based on irRECIST in the NSCLC cohort and UC cohort, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOSD based on irRECIST was 7.3 months (95% CI: 5.4, 18.4) and 14.5 months (95% CI: 3.7, NE) for the NSCLC cohort and UC cohort, respectively. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Immunogenicity Results: Pharmacokinetics Part 1 The PK profile of sasanlimab was assessed for IV (Q3W) and SC (Q4W) dose administration following the first and fourth dose on Cycle 1 and Cycle 4, respectively. Only trough PK samples were collected for the doses administered in between and thereafter. Following IV concentrations increased with increasing dose and with repeated dosing in all dose groups. Sasanlimab maximum serum concentration (C ) were generally observed at or shortly after max the end of infusion (median time for C [T ] ranged between 1 to 2 hours) for both Cycle max max 1 and Cycle 4. Serum sasanlimab exposure (area under the serum concentration-time profile from time zero to time tau [AUC ] and C ) increased with increasing dose across the dose tau max levels and the increases appeared to be approximately dose proportional for both Cycle 1 and Cycle 4. Plots of dose-normalized AUC and C values versus dose are consistent with tau max dose-proportional increases in exposure. Serum sasanlimab accumulation based on dose normalized AUC (R ) following repeated Q3W IV dosing was <2.4 for the 10 mg/kg IV tau ac dose group with individual R values ranging between 1.2 to 2.6 across the lower dose ac groups (0.5, 1 and 3 mg/kg). Following SC administration at 300 mg, median serum concentrations increased with repeated dosing. Sasanlimab was slowly absorbed from the site of injection, with a median T of 194 hours following a single dose and 166 hours following repeated dosing. Serum max sasanlimab accumulation based on AUC (R ) following repeated Q4W SC dosing was tau ac <2.1. Steady state exposure following repeated SC dosing at 300 mg Q4W fell within the range observed following IV administration at 1 and 3 mg/kg Q3W. Part 2 Following SC administration at 300 mg Q4W in participants with NSCLC and UC, trough values increased from the first dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 4 Day 1 and generally without further increase thereafter, suggesting that steady state has been reached. Overall, trough and postdose serum concentration (Cycle 1 Day 1) levels were generally similar between the 2 tumor types and consistent with Part 1. Therefore, trough concentrations were summarized across Part 1 and Part 2 for the combined group of participants with NSCLS, UC and other solid tumors. Pharmacodynamic PD-1 RO by sasanlimab was measured by the reduction of free receptor on the surface of CD (cluster of differentiation)8+ effector cells (CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD45RA+, CCR7-, CD279+) and CD8+ effector memory cells (CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD45RA-, CCR7-, CD279+) presented in pre- and postdose whole blood samples by flow cytometry. This data was originally analyzed and previously published without patient-specific gating leading to an increased level of variability. Both methods of analysis demonstrated similarly high levels of PD-1 RO after sasanlimab treatment at all dose levels and methods of administration. Immunogenicity The immunogenicity assessment included 136 ADA evaluable participants (defined as participants with at least 1 post-treatment ADA result) and 136 NAb evaluable participants (defined as participants with at least 1 post-treatment NAb result; NAb-negative participants included ADA-negative participants). For Part 1 IV dose cohorts, of the 21 ADA evaluable participants, 2 (9.5%) participants were positive for treatment-induced ADA following IV administration of sasanlimab, 1 in the 0.5 mg/kg dose cohort and the other in the 1 mg/kg dose cohort, with onset at Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 6 Day 1, respectively. The presence of ADA did not appear to be associated with hypersensitivity or infusion reactions. In addition, the presence of ADA did not appear to alter sasanlimab PK profile in those 2 ADA-positive participants relative to those who were ADA-negative. No NAb against sasanlimab were detected in these 2 ADA-positive participants. For Part 2 SC cohorts, 5 (7.8%) and 3 (8.1%) participants were positive for treatment-induced ADA in the NSCLC and UC cohorts, respectively; 3 (4.7%) and 1 (2.7%) participants were positive for NAb in the NSCLC and UC cohorts, respectively. For participants enrolled in the 300 mg SC dose cohorts (Part 1 and Part 2) of the study, 9 (7.8%) out of 115 ADA evaluable participants tested positive for treatment-induced ADA, with median onset at Day 112. The presence of ADA did not appear to be associated with hypersensitivity, based on the AE data reported at this time. In general, ADA-positive participants from the 300 mg SC dose cohorts appeared to have sasanlimab exposures (predose trough concentration [C ]) at the lower end of the distribution among all trough participants at the same dose level (300 mg SC), and this trend was particularly apparent in 2 participants with high ADA titer (log10 titer >3.3). Evaluation of this trend is still ongoing and will be reported separately. For the SC dose cohorts, 4 (3.5%) out of 115 NAb evaluable participants tested positive for NAb. Safety Results: In Part 1 dose escalation, 25 participants were dosed via IV administration and 15 participants were dosed via SC administration. In Part 2 dose expansion, all 68 participants with NSCLC and 38 participants with UC were dosed via SC administration. 1) All-causality treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), treatment-related AEs and SAEs overview In Part 1 IV dose cohorts, out of the 25 participants, there were 327 all-causality TEAEs reported by 24 (96.0%) participants. Of these, 102 TEAEs were determined by the investigator as treatment-related, and were reported by 21 (84.0%) participants. There were 10 (40.0%) participants who experienced SAEs which were not treatment-related per investigator assessment. There were no treatment-related SAEs in the IV dose cohorts. In Part 1 SC dose cohort, out of the 15 participants, there were 131 all-causality TEAEs reported by all the 15 participants. Of these, 57 TEAEs were determined by the investigator 3 (20.0%) participants who experienced SAEs which were not treatment-related per investigator assessment. There were no treatment-related SAEs in this cohort. There were no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) reported in the 40 participants treated with sasanlimab in dose escalation in Part 1. In Part 2 NSCLC (SC) cohort, out of the 68 participants, there were 411 all-causality TEAEs reported by 62 (91.2%) participants. Of these, 129 TEAEs were determined by the investigator as treatment-related, and were reported by 42 (61.8%) participants. There were 18 (26.5%) participants who experienced SAEs. In Part 2 UC (SC) cohort, out of the 38 participants, there were 246 all-causality TEAEs reported by 36 (94.7%) participants. Of these, 56 TEAEs were determined by the investigator as treatment-related, and were reported by 17 (44.7%) participants.

Conclusions: Part 1 (Dose Escalation):  No DLTs were reported in participants treated with escalating IV doses or SC dose of sasanlimab.  Increasing IV Q3W dose levels and 300 mg SC Q4W dose of sasanlimab were generally safe and well-tolerated in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including adenocarcinoma of salivary gland, endometrial adenocarcinoma, malignant melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma (n = 1 each), malignant peritoneal neoplasm, oesophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 2 each), small cell lung cancer (n = 3), sarcoma (n = 6), SCCHN (n = 7), and ovarian cancer (n = 14).  The high level of PD-1 RO was shown after administration of sasanlimab at all dose levels and methods of administration.  Clinical efficacy was observed in advanced or metastatic solid tumors for both IV and SC administration. Confirmed ORR based on RECIST version 1.1 and irRECIST was 17.9% (95% CI: 7.5%, 33.5%) and 17.9% (95% CI: 7.5%, 33.5%), respectively.  The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOR based on RECIST version 1.1 and irRECIST was 12.4 months (95% CI: 3.7, NE) and 13.0 months (95% CI: 4.1, NE), respectively.  The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median PFS based on RECIST version 1.1 and of median confirmed PFS based on irRECIST was 4.0 months (95% CI: 1.6, 5.6) and 4.9 months (95% CI: 1.9, 8.8), respectively.  Following both single and repeated IV Q3W dosing, exposures based on AUC and tau C appeared to increase with dose in an approximately dose-proportional manner. max  Absorption following SC dosing was slow with median T of 166 hours (~7 days) max after the fourth dose. Steady state exposure following repeated SC dosing at 300 mg Q4W fell within the range observed following IV administration at 1 and 3 mg/kg Q3W.  Following sasanlimab dosing, overall immunogenicity incidence was low with 9.5% (2/21) and 7.1% (1/14) of participants tested positive for ADA following IV and SC dosing in Part 1, respectively. No participant tested positive for NAb in Part 1. Part 2 (Dose Expansion):  SC administration of sasanlimab 300 mg Q4W was generally safe and well-tolerated in participants with NSCLC (n = 68) and UC (n = 38) with minimal rates of injection site reactions and a low incidence of immunogenicity.  The observed safety profile for sasanlimab was consistent with what is known for anti-PD-1 antibodies.  Promising clinical efficacy of SC sasanlimab was observed in advanced or metastatic NSCLC and UC. The observed clinical activity was aligned with other anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 in similar therapeutic settings. Confirmed ORR based on RECIST version 1.1 for the NSCLC and UC cohort was 16.4% (95% CI: 8.5%, 27.5%) and 18.4% (95% CI: 7.7%, 34.3%), respectively. Immune-related confirmed ORR based on irRECIST for the NSCLC cohort and UC cohort was 19.4% (95% CI: 10.8%, 30.9%) and 21.1% (95% CI: 9.6%, 37.3%), respectively. Confirmed ORR based on irRECIST was higher than from RECIST version 1.1 for both participants with NSCLC and UC when receiving sasanlimab 300 mg SC Q4W.  The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOR based on RECIST version 1.1 was 21.8 months (95% CI: 5.8, NE) and 13.9 months (95% CI: 3.8, NE) for the NSCLC cohort and UC cohort, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOR based on irRECIST was 22.1 months (95% CI: 6.8, NE) and NE (95% CI: 4.6, NE) for the NSCLC cohort and UC cohort, respectively.  The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median PFS based on RECIST version 1.1 was 3.7 months (95% CI: 1.9, 5.5) and 2.9 months (95% CI: 1.9, 3.8) for the NSCLC cohort and UC cohort, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median confirmed PFS based on irRECIST was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.8, 8.2) and 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.0, 14.5) for the NSCLC cohort and UC cohort, respectively.  The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median OS was 14.7 months (95% CI: 7.1, NE) and  After SC Q4W dosing, trough serum concentration levels were similar between Part 1 and Part 2, indicating no difference in exposure between the different solid tumor types.  Following sasanlimab SC dosing in Part 2, immunogenicity incidence was low, with 7.8% (5/64) and 8.1% (3/37) of participants testing positive for ADA in the NSCLC and UC cohorts, respectively, and 4.7% (3/64) and 2.7% (1/37) of participants testing positive for NAb in the NSCLC and UC cohorts, respectively. Among all participants from the SC cohorts (Part 1 and Part 2), 7.8% (9/115) of participants tested positive for ADA and 3.5% (4/115) of participants tested positive for NAb.
