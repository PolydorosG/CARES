CSR Version and Report Date: Final CSR (LPLV date) Version 1.0; 14 June 2022 Number of Study Center(s) and Investigator(s): A total of 6 participants were enrolled at 1 site in the United States. Details regarding the investigator and site involved in this study are available in Appendix 16.1.4.1. Publications: None, as of issuance of this CSR Study Period: Study Initiation Date (First Participant First Visit): 11 May 2021 Study Completion Date (Last Participant Last Visit): 06 August 2021 This study was completed as designed. Rationale: Ervogastat (PF-06865571) is a potent, reversible diacylglycerol acyltransferases 2 (DGAT2) inhibitor currently being developed for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis. It is an oral small molecule postulated to decrease hepatic triglyceride (TG) synthesis and hepatic lipid burden in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH. The purpose of this study was to assess the extent of excretion of PF-06865571 as well as the absolute bioavailability (F), fraction absorbed (F ) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a PF-06865571 in healthy male participants using a 14C-microtracer approach.

Statistical methods used in the study are as follows: Extent of Excretion: Participants who received 1 dose of [14C]PF-06865571, had evaluable total radioactivity concentration data, and had no protocol deviations or AEs that might have affected the extent of excretion analysis were included in the extent of excretion analysis. The percentage of the administered radioactivity excreted at each time interval, cumulatively through that interval and the total percent of dose recovered in urine and/or feces was determined based on total administered dose. Individual participant and median data profiles were graphically presented for the cumulative recovery of radioactivity. The total recovery of radioactivity was listed and summarized using descriptive statistics. The results were detailed in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) report and summarized in the CSR. Metabolic Profiling/Identification: Major metabolites of PF-06865571 in plasma, urine, and feces following oral dose of [14C]PF-06865571 were identified. Results of the metabolic profiling analysis were detailed in the ADME report and summarized in the CSR. PK: The PK concentration population for PF-06895571 was defined as all participants who received at least 1 dose of PF-06895571 and had at least 1 measurable concentration of PF-06895571. The PK parameter analysis population for PF-06895571 was defined as all participants dosed who had at least 1 of the PF-06895571 PK parameters of interest. Plasma PK parameters were listed and summarized descriptively by analyte (Total 14C, unlabeled PF-06865571, and [14C]PF-06865571) and treatment. The descriptive summary, concentration and PK parameters were presented in appropriate tables and figures. F was estimated as the ratio of adjusted geometric means of dose-normalized AUC for oral inf unlabeled PF-06865571 and IV labeled [14C]PF-06865571 in plasma. Geometric mean ratio and 90% confidence interval (CI) of F were determined. Total urine 14C amounts, percent 14C dose were listed by treatment (oral in Period 1 and IV in Period 2) and summarized using descriptive statistics. F was estimated as the ratio of the adjusted geometric means of % of administered a radioactive dose excreted into the urine following oral and IV administration of [14C]PF-06865571 microtracer dose over the same collection time (up to 48 hours post-dose) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively. Geometric mean ratio and 90% CI of F were determined. a Taste Assessments: The taste attributes from the taste questionnaires were listed and descriptively summarized and appropriate plots were generated. Safety: All participants assigned to study intervention and who received at least 1 dose of study intervention were included in the safety analysis. AEs, ECGs, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, and safety laboratory data were reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study. Any clinical laboratory, ECG, BP, and pulse rate abnormalities of potential clinical concern were described. Safety data were presented in tabular format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate. Methodology: This was a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, 2-period, fixed-sequence, single-dose study of PF-06865571 in healthy male participants to characterize the ADME properties of [14C]PF-06865571 following oral administration, and to evaluate the F and F of a PF-06865571 following oral administration of unlabeled PF-06865571 and IV administration of [14C]PF-06865571. In this study, each participant was to receive Regimens A and B in Periods 1 and 2, respectively. Regimen A in Period 1: PF-06865571 300 mg containing approximately 300 nCi 14C (ie, radiolabeled PF-06865571) was to be administered orally. Regimen B in Period 2: unlabeled PF-06865571 300 mg was to be administered orally followed at T (3 hours) by an IV dose of 300 nCi 14C in PF-06865571 100 g (3 Ci/mg max active drug) as an infusion over approximately 15 minutes. There was a wash-out period of 8-22 days between study intervention administration in Periods 1 and 2. Participants were to remain in the clinical research unit (CRU) from Day -1 Period 1 through the completion of Period 2. The duration of inpatient stay was between 12 days and 25 days. Number of Participants (planned and analyzed): Six participants were planned and dosed in the study. All 6 participants were included in the safety analysis set and extent of excretion analysis set. All participants with evaluable plasma or urine PK for PF-06865571 and [14C]PF-06865571 or Total 14C were included in the PK analysis. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Enrolled in this study were healthy male participants 18 to 60 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.4 kg/m2 and a total body weight >50 kg (110 lb). Study Interventions, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Numbers: On Day 1 Period 1, [14C]PF-06865571 300 mg (containing approximately 300 nCi 14C) was administered orally. On Day 1 Period 2, unlabeled PF-06865571 300 mg was administered orally 3 hours before the IV infusion of [14C]PF-06865571 100 µg (containing approximately 300 nCi 14C). On Day 1 of Periods 1 and 2, PF-06865571 (radiolabeled or unlabeled) was to be administered orally at approximately 08:00 (± 2 hours) within approximately 10 minutes after the completion of a standard breakfast, and with approximately 240 mL water.

Duration of Study Intervention: Study intervention was administered on Day 1 of Periods 1 and 2. Summary of Results: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics: All 6 participants were male with a median age of 42.0 years (range: 25 - 61 years). Median weight was 80.35 kg (range: 63.3 - 89.4 kg) and median BMI was 24.845 kg/m2 (range: 19.56 – 29.19 kg/m2). Exposure: On Day 1 Period 1, a single oral dose of [14C]PF-06865571 300 mg was administered. On Day 1 Period 2, a single oral dose of PF-06865571 300 mg was administered followed 3 hours later by a single IV dose of [14C]PF-06865571 100 µg. Safety Results: In Period 1, 4 (66.7%) participants experienced 9 all-causality treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). All TEAEs were mild in severity and none of them was serious AE. The most frequently reported all-causality TEAE was diarrhoea (2 participants, 33.3%). Two treatment-related TEAEs of pruritus and flushing were reported by 1 participant in Period 1. All TEAEs resolved by the end of the study. In Period 2, none of the participants experienced TEAEs. No participant had dose reduction or temporary/permanent discontinuation due to TEAEs. Laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs had no significant safety findings. Pharmacokinetic Results: Mass Balance In Period 1, following a single oral dose of PF-06865571 300 mg (containing 300 nCi [14C]PF-06865571), the mean ± standard deviation (SD) total recovery of the Period 1 orally administered radioactive dose over a period of up to 264 hours post-dose was 79.0 ± 16.7%, with 48.9 ± 16.3% in the urine and 30.1 ± 2.9% in the feces. The majority of radioactivity was excreted within 4 days of dosing. In Period 2, a single IV dose of PF-06865571 100 µg (containing 300 nCi [14C]PF-06865571) was administered at approximately 3 hours after a single oral dose of unlabeled PF-06865571 300 mg. The mean ± SD total recovery of the Period 2 IV administered radioactive dose over a period of up to 51 hours (48 hours post-radioactive dose) was 70.3 ± 15.1%, with 51.5 ± 15.8% in the urine and 18.8 ± 3.3% in the feces. Metabolic Profiling and Identification After oral dosing of [14C]PF-06865571 in Period 1, the major drug-related components detected in circulation were [14C]PF-06865571, M2, and M6 (representing 43.8%, 36.6%, and 11.3 % of circulating radioactivity, respectively). The major drug-related components detected in urine were M2 and coeluting M6, M7, and 584 (representing 24.9% and collectively 11.4% of administered dose, respectively). The predominant drug-related products in feces were coeluting M4 and 426, M2, M7, and M1 (representing collectively 10.0%, 7.0%, 6.3%, and 4.5% of administered dose, respectively). Plasma Unlabeled PF-06865571 PK, [14C]PF-06865571 PK, Total 14C PK and Absolute Oral Bioavailability (F) Plasma PK parameters are summarized descriptively in Table S3. Following administration of a single oral dose of PF-06865571 300 mg, F was 75.06% (90% CI: 71.06%, 79.29%), as measured by the ratio (oral [PO]/IV) of adjusted geometric mean dose normalized (to 1 mg equivalent) AUC (AUC [dn]) values. inf inf Urine Total 14C Parameters and Fraction Absorbed (F )a Urine Total 14C radioactivity parameters are summarized in Table S4. Based on the geometric mean ratio (PO/IV) of dose-normalized Total 14C_Urine values for 6 participants in PO and IV treatment with complete urine data, F was 92.78% (90% CI: a 62.07%, 138.68%). Taste Assessment Results: Across the 6 participants dosed in this study, none of the mean assessment scores of taste for all 6 domains were above 50 after 5 minutes post-dose, suggesting that none of the characteristics assessed reported a strong intensity (ie, above 75). Any moderate intensity taste trait present upon dosing dissipated over the 20-minute period of assessment. In addition, taste assessment in Period 2 elicited a lower response with minimal change from 3 min to 20 min. Conclusions: Mass Balance  Following a single oral [14C]PF-06865571 dose to healthy male participants, recovery of radioactivity was incomplete, but within the range observed in similar studies, with approximately 79% of dose recovered (~30% in feces; ~49% in urine). Metabolic Profiling and Identification  Following a single oral [14C]PF-06865571 dose, exposure of PF-06865571 accounted for approximately 39% of total radioactivity. Two major metabolites (>10% of radioactivity in circulation) were identified, representing 36.6% (M2) and 11.3% (M6) of radioactivity in plasma. Pharmacokinetics  PF-06865571 absolute oral bioavailability (F) and fraction absorbed (F ) were a estimated to be 75.06% and 92.78%, respectively.  The plasma PF-06865571 exposures were comparable after 300 mg oral dose in Period 1 and Period 2. Safety and Taste Assessment  PF-06865571 was generally safe and well-tolerated following either oral or simultaneous oral/IV administration.  Administration of a single, oral dose of PF-06865571 did not result in reporting of strong taste across the 6 domains of taste tested.
