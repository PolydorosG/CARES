COMPOUND NUMBER: PF-06291874 PROTOCOL NO.: B4801011 PROTOCOL TITLE: A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Trial to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Multiple Oral Doses of PF-06291874 Given as Monotherapy to Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Study Centers: The study was conducted at 16 centers in the United States. Study Initiation and Final Completion Dates: 19 August 2014 to 19 March 2015 Phase of Development: Phase 2a Study Objectives: Primary objective:  Assess the safety and tolerability of PF-06291874 in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subjects when administered as monotherapy. Secondary objectives:  To characterize the effect of PF-06291874 on glycemic control in subjects with T2DM;  To characterize the effect of PF-06291874 on lipid parameters;  To characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-06291874. METHODS Study Design: This was a randomized, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo-controlled, 5-arm (placebo and 4 active doses of PF-06291874), stratified, parallel group study conducted in subjects with T2DM. Subjects completed screening procedures to determine eligibility, followed by a 4-week washout period, during which time all background oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) were to be temporarily discontinued for the duration of the study. Prior to dosing with double-blind study treatment, a 7-day, single-blind, placebo run-in period was conducted. Subjects who were not receiving OAD medications at screening could start the placebo run-in period as soon as they were deemed eligible for the study. On Day -1, subjects entered the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) to begin an approximate 36-hour confinement period. On Day 0, blood samples were collected throughout the day to determine baseline safety and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers. Following confirmation that study eligibility statin therapy. Each stratum was randomized across treatment groups, such that the number of subjects taking concomitant statin therapy was approximately balanced across treatment groups. The number of statin users and non-statin users within each treatment group did not need to be equal. Beginning on Day 1, subjects received 1 of 5 blinded treatment regimens once daily (QD) for 28 days, including placebo or 15 mg, 35 mg, 75 mg, and 150 mg doses of PF-06291874. Subjects returned to the CRU for an outpatient visit on Day 14 for assessment of safety, PK, and PD biomarkers. On Day 27, subjects again returned to the CRU to begin an approximately 36-hour confinement period. On Day 28, subjects received their last dose of study treatment, and blood samples were collected throughout the day to determine safety, PK, and PD biomarkers. A follow-up visit occurred approximately 10 to 14 days following the last dose of study treatment. Total participation (from the screening to the follow-up visit) in the study for each subject ranged from a minimum of approximately 8 weeks to a maximum of approximately 11 weeks. The overall study design is outlined in Figure 1 and schedules of activities are presented in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. Figure 1.

Occurred after completion of all other procedures at given nominal time point. Approximately 32 subjects per arm were planned to be enrolled in the study for a total of approximately 160 subjects. A total of 172 subjects were randomized to study treatment (34 to placebo, 35 to PF-06291874 15 mg, 34 to PF-06291874 35 mg, 35 to PF-06291874 75 mg, and 34 to PF-06291874 150 mg). Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: Male subjects and non-childbearing potential female subjects between the ages of 18 and 70 years, inclusive at the time of the screening visit; with body mass index between 18.0 and 45.4 kg/m2; and a total body weight >50 kg (110 lbs) were eligible to participate in the study. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value at the screening visit (as assessed by study-specific central laboratory) had to meet one of the following criteria based on prior background OADs:  Currently taking acceptable OAD therapy  6.5-9.5%, inclusive;  Not currently taking any OAD therapy  7.0-10.5%, inclusive. Subjects treated with an acceptable OAD at screening had to agree to discontinue taking these medications for at least 4 weeks prior to start of dosing on Day 1 and to continue until completion of the follow-up visit. Subjects who were washed off acceptable OADs had to meet the fasting glucose requirements (ie, fasting glucose <270 mg/dL at the screening and run-in visit). Subjects with a history of Type 1 diabetes mellitus or secondary forms of diabetes with 1 or more self-reported hypoglycemic episodes of severe intensity within 3 months of screening; or 2 or more self-reported hypoglycemic episodes of severe intensity within the previous 6 months were excluded from the study. Study Treatment: Subjects were to take a total of 4 tablets per day and were instructed to take the study medication at approximately the same time each day with the morning meal. Subjects swallowed the study medication whole, and were not to manipulate or chew the medication prior to swallowing. Total treatment duration was 28 days. Subject dosing was witnessed by the CRU staff on Day -6, Day 0, Day 1, Day 14, and Day 28. PF-06291874 was provided by the sponsor as 5 mg, 25 mg and 100 mg tablets. Matching placebo tablets were also provided. Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Endpoints: Primary Endpoints:  Safety and tolerability of PF-06291874 were assessed throughout the study by adverse event (AE) monitoring, including hypoglycemic adverse event (HAE) and serious adverse event (SAE) reporting, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and  Mean daily glucose (MDG) response (Day 28 versus Day 0 baseline);  Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) response (change from baseline defined as the mean of Day 0 and Day 1 predose) on Day 14, and the mean of Days 28 and 29;  Post-dose (Day 14 and mean of Days 28 and 29) changes from baseline (defined as the mean of values from Day 0 and Day 1 predose measurements) lipid parameters including: triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) , non-HDL-C, oxidized LDL-C, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and number, lipoprotein-a (Lp[a]), and apolipoprotein B100 (Apo B100);  Steady state (Day 28) PF-06291874 PK endpoints including: Area under the glucose concentration curve from time 0 to 4 hours postdose (AUC ), maximum observed 0-4 concentration during the 24 hour period (C ), C , time for C (T ), and apparent max min max max clearance (CL/F), as data permitted. There were no efficacy evaluations included in this study. Safety Evaluations: Safety evaluations included monitoring of AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory assessments, physical examinations, vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure [BP]) and 12-lead ECGs. In addition, the assessment of HAEs was based on Investigator review of the subjects’ completed home glucose monitoring logs as well as results reported by the central laboratory, along with any signs and symptoms reported. Elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) at predefined levels, and overdose with no associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory test results were also to be reported as AEs. Statistical Methods: PK Analysis: The PK concentration analysis set was defined as all subjects randomized and treated who had at least 1 concentration. The PK parameter analysis set was defined as all subjects randomized and treated who had at least 1 of the PK parameters of interest. The plasma PK parameters were summarized descriptively by dose. Plasma concentrations were summarized descriptively by dose and nominal PK sampling time. PD Analysis: The full analysis set (FAS) was used to analyze PD parameters. The FAS was defined as all subjects randomized and who received at least 1 dose of randomized treatment. Mean Daily Glucose: The MDG was determined from the area under the glucose concentration curve (AUC) of the glucose concentrations measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 15 and 24 hours postdose. This AUC was divided by 24 resulting in weighted MDG. Day 0 MDG served as the baseline. Absolute values and changes from baseline were summarized descriptively by treatment and time. Change from baseline in MDG was difference between the LSMs of each PF-06291874 group and the placebo group with the corresponding 90% CI and the 2-sided p-values derived from the model were presented at the time points specified above. The p-values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Dose-response modeling of change from baseline in MDG was done using the maximal efficacy (E ) model at Day 28. max Fasting Plasma Glucose: The average of Days 0 and 1 predose values served as the baseline and the average of Days 28 and 29 were presented under Day 28. Change from baseline in FPG was analyzed using the mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) using data collected at Days 14 and 28. The model included baseline value, time (study day), and treatment group. Subject was used as a random effect. Lipid Panel (Triglycerides, Total Cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, Non HDL-C): For all lipid parameters, the average of Days 0 and 1 predose values were used as the baseline and the average of Days 28 and 29 were presented under Day 28. Percent change from baseline for each parameter in the lipid panel was analyzed by the MMRM using data collected at Days 14 and 28. The model included baseline value, statin use, time (study day), and treatment group. Subject was used as a random effect. Safety Analysis: The frequency and severity of treatment-emergent and treatment-related AEs, including HAEs, were presented in tabular format and summarized descriptively, by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; version 18.0) system organ class, preferred term and by study treatment. Laboratory data, vital signs and ECG data were listed and summarized descriptively in accordance with Sponsor’s reporting standards, with summarization by individual subject by nominal visit. RESULTS Subject Disposition and Demography: A total of 462 subjects were screened and 172 subjects were randomized to study treatment as summarized in Table 4. Of these, 166 subjects (96.5%) completed the study and 6 subjects discontinued. All subjects were analyzed for safety. Discontinuations attributed to the last study treatment received. Abbreviation: ECG = electrocardiogram. Demographic characteristics are summarized by treatment group and overall in Table 5. All the treatment groups displayed similar baseline disease characteristics (duration of disease, FPG, HbA1c [%] and LDL-C) as summarized in Table 6. Use of statins at baseline was similar in each of the treatment groups (37.1% to 42.9% of subjects in each treatment group). Abbreviations: BMI = body mass index, n = number of subjects, SD = standard deviation. a. BMI was defined as weight/(height × 0.01)2. Table 6. Baseline Disease Characteristics Duration of disease (to onset day) was presented. Baseline for fasting plasma glucose was defined as the average of Days 0 and 1 predose values. Baseline for HbA1c was defined as the last predose measurement prior to first dose for the study. Baseline for LDL-C was defined as the average of Days 0 and 1 predose values. Abbreviations: HbA1c = glycosylated hemoglobin; LDL-C = low density lipoprotein cholesterol; N = number of subjects in each treatment group; SD = standard deviation. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Results: Pharmacokinetic Results: Following multiple QD oral administration of PF-06291874 at doses ranging from 15 mg to 150 mg in T2DM subjects, peak plasma concentrations were reached at a median T of 6 hours in all dose groups. Both peak exposure (C ) and total max max on plots of dose normalized individual and geometric mean AUCtau and Cmax values by treatment group. Apparent clearance averaged about 1.1 to 1.2 L/h across all dose groups. Variability in plasma exposure within each treatment group ranged from 25% to 32% based on geometric percentage coefficient of variance (%CV) for AUC and C . Steady state tau max appeared to have been reached on or before Day 14 based on comparison of median predose concentrations on Days 14 and 28. Plasma PF-06291874 PK parameters are summarized in Table 7. min Pharmacodynamic Results: Mean Daily Glucose: Baseline mean MDG values across treatment groups ranged from 199.59 mg/dL to 227.65 mg/dL. On Day 28, mean decreases from baseline values were evident in each of the PF-06291874 treatment groups, whereas there was a small mean increase from baseline in the placebo group (Table 8). Compared with placebo, the differences between each of the PF-06291874 treatment groups were statistically significant. Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline in MDG on Day 28 are presented graphically in Figure 2 and indicate that changes from baseline are dose-dependent. Results of the dose-response modeling of the change from baseline in MDG using the E model on max Day 28 are also presented in Table 9. The dose resulting in 50% of maximal response (ED ) 50 was 22.99 mg/dL and the predicted values were close to the actual values indicating that the E model fitted the data well. max Table 8. Descriptive Summary of Absolute Baseline Values and Statistical Analysis (ANCOVA) of Change From Baseline for MDG (mg/dL) on Day 28 - FAS Nominal time was used for MDG calculation. Baseline was defined as the MDG value on Day 0. Abbreviations: ANCOVA = analysis of covariance; CI = confidence interval; FAS = full analysis set; LS = least square; MDG = mean daily glucose; N = total number of subjects on Day 0; n = total number of subjects on Day 28; SD = standard deviation. a.

Nominal time was used for MDG calculation. Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval, LS = least squares, MDG = mean daily glucose. Table 9. Dose-response Analysis (E ) of Change From Baseline for MDG (mg/dL) max on Day 28 - FAS maxBaseline MDG was the Day 0 value. Baseline MDG was used in the model as a covariate for E . max Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval, E = effect at dose = 0; ED = dose resulting in 50% of maximal 0 50 response; E = maximal effect; MDG = mean daily glucose; N = number of subjects with evaluable values on max Day 28; vs = versus. Fasting Plasma Glucose: Mean baseline FPG was similar across all treatment groups ranging from 175 to 190 mg/dL. On Days 14 and 28, greater mean decreases from baseline values were evident in each of the PF-06291874 treatment groups compared with the placebo group. The differences between each of the PF-06291874 treatment groups compared with placebo baseline are dose-dependent. A time profile of means of change from baseline for FPG suggest a dose-dependent decrease in mean FPG on Days 14 and 28 with a return to near baseline values at the follow-up visit. Safety Results: Details of the treatment-emergent SAE are provided in Table 10. A summary of all-causality and treatment-related non-serious AEs listed by system organ class (SOC) and according to MedDRA preferred terms is presented in Table 11 and Table 12, respectively.

Includes all data collected since the first dose of study drug. Abbreviations: SAE = serious adverse event; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; SOC = System Organ Class. All-Causalities All-Causalities Subjects were only counted once per treatment for each row. Includes all data collected since the first dose of study drug. Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; SOC = System Organ Class. Treatment-Related Subjects were only counted once per treatment for each row. Includes all data collected since the first dose of study drug. Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; SOC = System Organ Class. No deaths were reported in this study. One subject in the placebo group discontinued from treatment due to an AE (hyperglycemia) that was considered unrelated to study treatment. The AE was moderate in severity and resolved. There were no dose reductions or temporary discontinuations due to AEs during study. Hypoglycemic AEs: One (1) subject (2.9%) in the PF-06291874 75 mg group experienced 2 HAEs, on Days 12 and 13. These were both mild in severity and asymptomatic. The subject continued in the study. Three (3) other subjects, 1 each in PF-06291874 15 mg, 35 mg and 75 mg groups experienced a single hypoglycemic event prior to the start of the study. There were no hypoglycemic events in the 150 mg group. None of the HAEs were classified by the Investigators as severe. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations: The incidence of laboratory abnormalities was comparable across the treatment groups in the study and there was no apparent dose related increase in the frequency of laboratory abnormalities (not including glucometer measurements). The most common laboratory abnormality was increased glucose defined as >1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (ULN = 100 mg/dL), which occurred in 29, 29, 20, 30, and 24 subjects in the placebo, PF-06291874 15 mg, 35 mg, 75 mg, and 150 mg treatment groups, respectively. Hyperglycemia was defined in the protocol as FPG 270 mg/dL. Two subjects (1 each in the placebo and PF-06291874 75 mg groups) reported AEs of hyperglycemia; both observed in 12, 11, 6, 7 and 8 subjects in the placebo, PF-06291874 15 mg, 35 mg, 75 mg, and 150 mg treatment groups, respectively. Four (4) subjects reported laboratory test abnormalities that were considered AEs by Investigator (Table 12). Laboratory Tests of Special Interest: Baseline values and results of the statistical analysis (MMRM) of percent change from baseline for LDL-C, total cholesterol, HDL-C, non HDL-C and triglycerides on Day 28 are presented in Table 13.  LDL-C: Mean baseline LDL-C concentrations were similar across all treatment groups ranging from 114 to 122 mg/dL. On Days 14 and 28, small and comparable mean increases from baseline LDL-C values were observed for the placebo group, and the 15 mg, 35 mg, and 75 mg PF-06291874 treatment groups; however the mean increase from baseline for the 150 mg PF-06291874 dose group was >10% and was statistically significant compared with placebo on Days 14 and 28.  Total Cholesterol: Mean baseline total cholesterol concentrations were similar across all treatment groups ranging from 185 to 195 mg/dL. On Days 14 and 28, small changes from baseline values for the 15 mg, 35 mg, and 75 mg PF-06291874 groups were similar to placebo, however there was a statistically significant increase in the 150 mg treatment group.  HDL-C: Mean baseline HDL-C concentrations were similar across all treatment groups ranging from 40 to 47 mg/dL. On Days 14 and 28, small mean increases from baseline values were evident in each of the PF-06291874 treatment groups compared with the placebo group, however the increases were larger in the 75 mg and 150 mg treatment groups suggesting that there may be evidence of a dose dependent response. The increase was statistically significant for the PF-06291874 150 mg group compared with placebo on Days 14 and 28.  Non HDL-C: Mean baseline non HDL-C concentrations were similar across all treatment groups ranging from 140 to 150 mg/dL. On Days 14 and 28, small mean changes from baseline values for the 15 mg, 35 mg, and 75 mg PF-06291874 groups were similar to placebo, however there was a statistically significant increase in the 150 mg treatment group.  Triglycerides: Mean baseline triglyceride concentrations were similar across all treatment groups ranging from 161 to 200 mg/dL. On Day 28 changes for all PF-06291874 dose groups were similar to placebo.

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; FAS = full analysis set; HDL-C = high density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C = low density lipoprotein cholesterol; LS = least square; MMRM = mixed model for repeated measurements; N = total number of subjects on Day 0; n = total number of subjects on Day 28; SD = standard deviation.a.Two-sided p-values are from MMRM with baseline value, time (study day), statin use, treatment group, study day and treatment interaction as fixed effects.  Lipoprotein Particle Characterization: Total LDL-C particles and ApoB 100 appeared to be numerically increased in the highest dose group (150 mg) compared to the lower dose groups and placebo. Additionally, Lp (a) appeared to be decreased in all dose groups compared to placebo. For all other particle size measurements, there were no clear dose related trends in change from baseline.  Evaluation of Liver Enzymes: There appeared to be small dose related increases in mean AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase and lactate dehydrogenase. The increases appeared to occur within the first 2 weeks of dosing and remained constant or decreased over 14 to 28 days of dosing. The majority of the observed increases in ALT and AST following dosing with PF-06291874 remained within the laboratory reference range and returned to baseline values following discontinuation of dosing. None of these changes were associated with increases in bilirubin.  Vital Signs/ECG: On average, Day 14 and Day 28 systolic and diastolic BP changes from baseline were numerically higher than placebo for doses of PF-06291874 35 mg and above. There did not appear to be a consistent pattern between mean changes from baseline in heart rate. There were also more subjects that had categorical increases in systolic BP of 30 mmHg in the 150 mg PF-06291874 dose group, although none of the vital signs values that met categorical summarization criteria were considered clinically significant and there were no AEs related to vital signs changes. not appear to be a correlation between mean corrected QT interval using Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) changes from baseline and increasing doses of PF-06291874. There were no subjects with corrected or uncorrected QT values 500 msec. No ECG abnormalities that met categorical summarization criteria were considered clinically significant or considered to be AEs, although there was an increased incidence of subjects in the active treatment groups having increases in QTcF of between 30 and 60 msec from baseline. CONCLUSIONS:  Administration of PF-06291874 in the dose range of 15 mg to 150 mg was generally safe and well-tolerated in the subjects with T2DM evaluated in this study. There were no deaths or dose reductions due to AEs. There was 1 subject in the placebo group who was discontinued from treatment due to an AE (hyperglycemia) that was considered unrelated to study treatment. There were no clear, dose related increases in the frequency of AEs with increasing dose of PF-06291874. The incidence of HAEs was low and not dose related; none were classified by the Investigators as severe.  Other than the laboratory parameters of special interest there were no dose related trends in the frequency of laboratory abnormalities. There were minor increases in systolic BP and diastolic BP which were reversed following the discontinuation of the study medication. There were no subjects with corrected or uncorrected QT values 500 msec. There was an increased incidence of subjects in the active treatment groups having increases in QTcF of between 30 and 60 msec from baseline. However, no ECG abnormalities were considered clinically significant or reported as AEs.  There appeared to be small dose related increases in mean AST and ALT. There were no associated increases in total bilirubin.  There was a dose-dependent decrease from baseline in MDG and FPG following multiple oral doses of PF-06291874 compared to placebo. The magnitude of change was statistically significant.  Doses up to 75 mg had minimal effects on plasma LDL-C, but LDL-C was increased >10% over baseline at the 150-mg dose. A small dose related increase in HDL-C was also observed. No meaningful trends in circulating triglycerides were noted.  Following QD administration of 15 mg to 150 mg PF-06291874 to subjects with T2DM for 28 days, median plasma T was 6 hours across all 4 treatment groups and max steady-state AUC and C increased proportionally with dose. tau max
