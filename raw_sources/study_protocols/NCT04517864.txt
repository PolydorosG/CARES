Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table Amendment 1 20 April 2021  In the Schedule of Activities for Screening and Day 1, “Audiological evaluation and history by an audiologist” the name of the Audiology Study Guide was updated.Rationale: it was updated to its finalized name.  In the Schedule of Activities for the Intervention Period, the header note in the table (Row 4/Column 11) was updated per the PACL 25 Jun 2020. Rationale: updated per the PACL and for clarity.  In the Schedule of Activities for the Intervention Period, “Audiological Evaluation by an audiologist” the name of the Audiology Study Guide was updated to its finalized name. Rationale: it was updated to its finalized name.  In the Schedule of Activities for the Intervention Period, “Pregnancy test” Notes were updated to enable pregnancy tests for outside testing to be provided by the site.Rationale: Enables testing for pregnancy between visits with a test at appropriate level of accuracy.  In the Schedule of Activities for the Intervention Period / Month 6 and Month 9/EOP, added a note that for the EOP visit only (Month 6 or Month 9/EOP, as appropriate), the window for audiological/BAEP central read (including any repeat assessments if deemed necessary by the central reader) is -7/+21 days. All other assessments, including the primary audiological/BAEP assessments, must be completed within ±7 days. Rationale: Allows for audiological/BAEP central read and any repeats.  In the Schedule of Activities for the Intervention Period / Skin punch biopsy for evaluation of axonal dystrophy and IENFD, a note was added that at the EOP visit (Month 6 or Month 9, as appropriate), the skin biopsy must be collected before Active Therapy administration.Rationale: Ensures that secondary safety evaluations are completed prior to the start of active therapy extension phase.  In the Schedule of Activities for the Intervention Period, Study Intervention Dispensing Notes were updated to clarify that at the Month 6 visit (only for those eligible participants who enter the active therapy extension phase at Month 6 [see Section 4.1.]) or 9/EOP visit, if the neurological or audiological/BAEP assessments have not yet been completed, double-blind therapy continues to be dispensed until the neurological and audiological/BAEP assessments Document History Document History  Section 5.2. Exclusion Criteria, Prohibited Prior/Concomitant Therapy, 22, on QT prolonging drugs removed. Rationale: An analysis of applicable nonclinical and clinical data indicates that the risk for PF-06651600 to cause clinically meaningful QT prolongation in humans is low. Prohibition of these medications is no longer required.  Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria, 23, Updated to clearly exclude participation in investigational vaccine trials. Rationale: Update explicitly excludes concurrent participation in studies of investigational vaccines.  Section 6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing was updated to add that at the EOP visit (Month 6 or Month 9/EOP, as appropriate), additional double-blind therapy may be dispensed if the neurological and/or audiological/BAEP assessments (including the central read confirmation and any repeat assessments if deemed necessary by the central reader) are not yet completed. Additional double-blind therapy would be dispensed as a 32-day supply, but dosing may not extend past the end of the +21 day EOP visit window. Once neurological and audiological/BAEP EOP assessments are complete, active therapy may be dispensed either on site or by shipping to the study participant.Rationale: Allows continued double-blind dosing until safety assessments are completed, within a defined window (+21 days).  Section 6.5.3. Vaccinations, was updated given the widespread use of vaccines against COVID-19 Rationale: This change was made to provide affirmatory clarity regarding COVID-19 vaccination before, during, and after the study.  Section 8.2.6.

PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1. Synopsis Protocol Title: Short Title: PLACEBO-CONTROLLED SAFETY STUDY OF RITLECITINIB (PF- 06651600) IN ADULTS WITH ALOPECIA AREATA Rationale:PF-06651600 inhibits Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and members of the tyrosine kinase family expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) and is being developed as an oral treatment for patients with alopecia areata (AA). This study includes investigation of the clinical relevance of changes observed in non-clinical toxicity studies in dogs treated with PF-06651600. Specifically, in a 9-month dog study, axonal dystrophy (axonal swelling due to neurofilament accumulation without evidence of axonal degeneration) in the central and peripheral nervous systems at ≥20 mg/kg/day (a 12-fold exposure multiple relative to the clinical dose of 50 mg), and functional auditory deficits on brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) at the highest dose of 40 mg/kg/day (a 29-fold exposure multiple relative to the clinical dose of 50 mg) were observed. Consequently, this study is specifically designed to evaluate the safety, including assessment of BAEPs and intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) histology in skin punch biopsies, of PF-06651600 in adult participants with AA. Objectives, Estimands and Endpoints PF-06651600. Objectives Endpoints Overall Design: Study B7981037 will investigate PF-06651600 in participants with AA. This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06651600, including the assessments of BAEP and IENF, in adults 18 to ≤50 years of age with ≥25% scalp hair loss due to AA. Disclosure Statement: This is a Parallel Treatment study with 2 arms that is Investigator, Sponsor, and Participant blinded. Number of Participants: A total of approximately 60 participants will be randomized in the study. Intervention Groups and Duration: Approximately 60 adults 18 to 50 years of age will be randomized 1:1 to receive either PF-06651600 or placebo. The total duration of participation in the study is approximately 26 months. This includes up to a 5-week screening period, a 9-month placebo-controlled treatment phase, a 15-month active therapy extension phase, and a 4-week follow-up period (See Section 1.2). Screening will occur within 35 days prior to Day 1 of the study to confirm that selection criteria for the study are met. At Month 9, the placebo-controlled phase will end, and all participants may enter the active therapy extension phase of the study and receive PF-06651600. At Month 6, any participant with a baseline overall SALT score ≤75 will have the option to enter the active therapy extension phase if the overall SALT score at Month 6 has increased from baseline by ≥25 points. Data Monitoring Committee: Yes Statistical Methods For the primary safety endpoint, there is no formal hypothesis testing. The analyses will be descriptive. Summary statistics for each group with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided. Estimands are not applicable since there is no formal statistical hypothesis testing for this study. 1.2. Schema                    2. INTRODUCTION 2.1. Study Rationale PF-06651600 is being developed as an oral treatment for patients with alopecia areata (AA) based on its mechanism of action and the clinical results obtained in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. This study is specifically designed to evaluate the safety of PF-06651600 in adult participants with AA. This includes assessments of brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) and intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) histology. The BAEP and IENF assessments are being performed to investigate the clinical relevance of changes observed in non-clinical toxicity studies in dogs treated with PF-06651600 (see Section 4.2). 2.2. Background AA is a chronic, relapsing, T-cell mediated autoimmune disorder characterized by non- scarring hair loss affecting children and adults across all ages, races, and sexes.(1, 2) AA is associated with other immune diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and autoimmune diseases such as thyroiditis and vitiligo.(2) Clinical presentation of AA can be limited to small, circular patches of scalp hair loss (patchy hair loss, alopecia focalis), involve complete loss of hair on the scalp (alopecia totalis [AT]), or total loss of hair on the scalp and body (alopecia universalis [AU]).(3) Patchy alopecia is the most common form of AA which may develop into the more extensive and often treatment-resistant forms of AA, especially with earlier age of onset.(4) It is estimated that AA affects as many as 6 to 7 million individuals in the United States (US)(2) and 147 million worldwide.(5) Depression, anxiety, and panic disorders are often observed in patients with AA and the coping mechanisms of AA patients mirror those of grief and bereavement.(6, 7) A substantial body of evidence demonstrates a widespread impact of AA on the psychological health of both adult and pediatric patients with AA, including impairment in self-esteem, increased incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders and other psychological conditions,(8-12) problems with social relations,(13) decreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and general quality of life (QoL), as well as the QoL of their families.(5, 14-21) No drugs have been approved for the treatment of AA in most countries/regions, including the US and the European Union (EU). Review of the treatment guidelines and recommendations indicate that a number of off-label therapies are frequently used after assessing factors such as the age of the patient, disease extent, and disease duration. There is neither a cure for AA nor is there a therapy convincingly demonstrated to induce and sustain remission long term.(22-26) CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and mast cells are involved in the pathogenesis of AA. The possible inflammatory pathways in AA include cytokines from the type 1 helper T cell (TH1) axis, including interferon (IFN) alpha (), IFN gamma (), and IFN-induced protein 10 (IP-10).(27, 28) Mouse models have shown that interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15 play a rmoaley ianl stoh ep ilnayit iaa trioolne oinf athueto p-arethaoctgievnee CsiDs 8of cAeAlls.( 2t9h)at attack hair follicles. IL-12 and IL-23 The cytokine signaling pathways of IFN and IL-15, among others, can be blocked via Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition, supporting the rationale of a JAK inhibitor in the treatment of AA.(30) Indeed, treatment with the JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and ruxolitinib is reported to reverse AA in a mouse model.(31) Clinically, there are case reports and case series reporting that these JAK inhibitors demonstrate efficacy in AA.(31-39) The tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase family of protein kinases consists of five members (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase [BTK], bone marrow tyrosine kinase on chromosome X [BMX], interleukin (IL)-2 inducible T cell kinase [ITK], TEC and tyrosine kinase expressed in T cells [TXK]), primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells.(40, 41) T cells express three TEC kinases, ITK, TEC and TXK that are activated downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR). BTK plays crucial roles in B cell development and function and is activated downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR). Additionally, TEC kinases have overlapping roles in mediating activation signals in NK cells, mast cells and other hematopoietic cells.(42) Since CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and mast cells have all been implicated in the pathophysiology of AA,(28, 31, 43, 44) inhibition of TEC kinases has the potential to contribute to efficacy in this disease by modulating the functional activity of these pathogenic effector cells. PF‑06651600 is a covalent and irreversible inhibitor of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) with high selectivity over the other three JAK isoforms (JAK1, JAK2, and tyrosine kinase 2 [TYK2]). PF‑06651600 also inhibits irreversibly the TEC family kinases with selectivity over the broader human kinome. Treatment with PF‑06651600 is expected to inhibit the inflammatory pathways mediated by IL‑7, IL‑15, and IL‑21, all implicated in AA. Moreover, due to lack of activity against the other JAK isoforms, PF‑06651600 is expected to spare immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL‑10, IL‑27 and IL‑35, which are critical to the maintenance of immunosuppressive functions and immune homeostasis. 2.2.1. Nonclinical Studies Data from nonclinical studies support the planned clinical trials with PF-06651600; these studies are described in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). In the first 9-month study of PF-06651600 in dogs, bilateral axonal dystrophy (not axonal degeneration) in the olivary nuclei of the brainstem was observed in males and females administered ≥20 mg/kg/day. Auditory testing (BAEP) performed on recovery control and high dose animals during the last 2 weeks of the 3-month recovery period showed BAEP waveform defects. There was partial recovery in the brainstem microscopic lesions at the end of the 3-month recovery period. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was the lowest dose tested of 5 mg/kg/day, based on the adverse finding of axonal dystrophy in the brainstem and associated waveform defects in males and females administered ≥20 mg/kg/day. In the second 9-month study in dogs, PF-06651600-related, minimal to moderate axonal dystrophy (axonal swelling due to neurofilament accumulation without evidence of axonal degeneration) in the brainstem, minimal axonal dystrophy in the sciatic nerve and branches of the vagus nerve, and an increased severity (from minimal to mild) of axonal dystrophy in the spinal cord were observed at ≥20 mg/kg/day (a 12-fold exposure multiple relative to the clinical dose of 50 mg). Minimal to mild axonal dystrophy was also observed in the white matter of the rostral vermis of the cerebellum at ≥10 mg/kg/day. Adverse BAEP findings were noted in 1 male and 1 female administered 40 mg/kg/day (a 29-fold exposure multiple relative to the clinical dose of 50 mg) at 7 and/or 9 months of dosing, and these findings completely recovered at the end of the 6-month recovery in the animal that continued into the recovery phase. The auditory deficits observed were consistent with a central, not peripheral, effect on auditory function. The NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day, based on adverse over-immunosuppression and axonal dystrophy in the central and peripheral nervous system at ≥20 mg/kg/day and accompanied by auditory deficits (BAEP) at the highest dose of 40 mg/kg/day. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) exposure margins in this study at the NOAEL at study end were approximately 1.5x and 6.5x relative to the predicted exposure at the 200 mg and 50 mg clinical QD doses, respectively (Table 1). For a complete description of these studies please refer to the current version of the IB. 2.2.2. Clinical Experience Data from Phase 1 clinical studies, including pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and food effect, support the planned clinical trials with PF-06651600; these studies are described in the IB. There are completed and ongoing Phase 2 and 3 studies with PF-06651600 in a number of disease indications including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), AA, ulcerative colitis, vitiligo, and Crohn’s disease. 2.2.2.1. Phase 2a Study in Alopecia Areata Study B7931005 was a Phase 2a study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of 2 investigational JAK inhibitors, PF-06700841 and PF-06651600, in adult participants with AA (restricted to those with ≥50% scalp hair loss without evidence of hair regrowth within the previous 6 months; current episode of hair loss ≤7 years). The study included 3 periods: an initial 24-week double-blind treatment period, an up to 48-week single-blind extension (SBE) period, and a 24-week cross-over open label extension period. During the initial 24-week double-blind treatment period, participants received an induction dose of 200 mg QD for 4 weeks, followed by maintenance dosing of 50 mg QD for 20 weeks of PF-06651600; an induction dose of 60 mg QD for 4 weeks, followed by maintenance dosing of 30 mg QD for 20 weeks of PF-06700841; or a matching placebo for 24 weeks. This was followed by an SBE period including a withdrawal/re-treatment period for responders and a treatment period for non-responders. After the SBE phase eligible participants could PF-06651600 achieved the primary endpoint, SALT change from baseline, at Week 24. PF- 06651600 was efficacious compared to placebo as measured by proportion of subjects achieving ≥30% and ≥90% improvement from baseline in SALT score (SALT30 and SALT90). PF-06651600 showed continued improvements in the proportion of participants achieving various percent improvements from baseline in SALT score (SALT30, SALT50, SALT75, SALT90, and SALT100) during the initial 24-week treatment period showing significant responses compared to placebo group starting from Week 6 for SALT30, SALT50 and SALT 75, Week 12 for SALT90, and at Week 24 for SALT100. The proportion of subjects achieving at least 1 grade improvement in both eyelash assessment (ELA) and eyebrow assessment (EBA) for PF-06651600 continued to increase over the initial double-blind treatment period, significantly differentiating from placebo as early as Week 4 for ELA and as early as Week 6 for EBA. Participants who received placebo in the initial treatment period followed by PF-06651600 in the SBE period had a response consistent with the responses of participants who received PF- 06651600 during the initial treatment period. There was a loss of efficacy based on SALT30 compared to the response in the initial treatment period, as SALT30 was only achieved by 57% of subjects receiving PF-06651600 who had previously responded in the initial treatment period. Non-responders who continued treatment for another 24 weeks were unlikely to respond during the SBE period. Blood samples for PK were collected predose at each visit from baseline to Week 24 as well as at 0.5 hours post dose on Weeks 8 and 20; 0.5 and 1 hour post dose on Week 12; and 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours post dose on Weeks 4 and 24. The observed mean C and max,ss mean AUC for 200 mg QD in the AA population were 1601 ng/mL and 6353 ng*hr/mL, tau respectively, slightly higher than the C and AUC for 200 mg QD observed in the max,ss tau healthy population, 1422 ng/mL and 4069 ng*hr/mL, respectively. PF-06651600 had an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated. No participants in the PF-06651600 group experienced an SAE. During the initial treatment period, the number of AEs in the placebo group (105) was higher than in the PF-06651600 group (82), although the number of subjects reporting AEs was similar in the placebo and PF-06651600 groups (35 [74.5%] subjects and 30 [66.7%] subjects, respectively). Two participants in the PF- 06651600 group discontinued from treatment in the initial treatment period due to an AE (angioedema and elevated creatine kinase level, both of which resolved), but continued in the study. One active non-responder who received PF-06651600 discontinued from the SBE period due to a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of abnormal liver function test; the laboratory values did not reach the criteria for Hy’s Law. The most common (≥5%) AEs during the initial treatment period in the PF-06651600 group were in the Infections and Infestations (upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, folliculitis), Gastrointestinal Disorders (nausea, diarrhea), and the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (acne, atopic dermatitis) categories, and the majority of events were mild. No serious infections or cases of herpes zoster or herpes simplex were reported in the PF- 06651600 group during the initial treatment period; 1 AE of herpes simplex was reported in the PF-06651600 group during the SBE period. During the initial treatment period, absolute lymphocyte and platelet counts showed a slight decrease from baseline in PF-06651600 treatment group. The mean (90% CI) percent CFB absolute neutrophil count in the PF-06651600 treatment group at Week 2 and Week 24 was 17.30% (23.12%, -11.47%) and -8.44% (15.59%, -1.29%), respectively. In the PF-06651600 treatment group, platelet counts remained slightly lower than baseline value with mean (90% CI) percent CFB of -17.89% (-21.32%, -14.47%) and -9.61% (13.87%, 5.35%) at Week 2 and Week 24, respectively. There was a decrease in absolute lymphocyte count in the PF-06651600 treatment group during the COE period but there was no consistent trend in lymphocyte or platelet count during the SBE period. There were no clinically significant auditory changes in the active treatment groups. A mild TEAE of neurosensory deafness was reported in 1 participant in the placebo group during the initial 24-week treatment period. There were no clinically significant findings in electrocardiograms (ECG) or vital signs, except increased diastolic blood pressure >20 mmHg in 1 participant each on placebo and PF-06651600. There were no increased safety risks with re-exposure to PF-06651600 or after cross-over to treatment with either PF-06651600 or PF-06700841. 2.2.2.2. Phase 2a Study in Rheumatoid Arthritis The completed Phase 2a study B7981006 was an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study in participants with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with an inadequate response to methotrexate. A total of 70 participants were randomized to study treatment; 28 participants received placebo and 42 participants received PF-06651600. PF-06651600 was determined to be safe and well tolerated in this study. There were no deaths or SAEs. The TEAEs reported in more than 5% of participants with RA receiving PF- 06651600 were influenza and lymphopenia. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs, ECG, or audiometric assessments. For more details, including effects on laboratory parameters, please refer to the current version of the IB. 2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment The preliminary clinical data indicate that PF-06651600 has a favorable benefit:risk profile. It provided clinical benefit (scalp hair regrowth) in patients with AA and was determined to be well tolerated and to have an acceptable safety profile in the clinical studies to date. Reductions in platelet counts and lymphocyte counts were observed during treatment with 200 mg QD but were not considered clinically meaningful and improved after switching to 50 mg QD. PF-06651600 is an immunomodulator and, like others in this class, can be associated with the potential risk of infections (including serious infections), opportunistic infections, and viral reactivation. The risk of infection will be monitored in this study. In animal studies, PF-06651600 administration was associated with effects on fetal development, including skeletal and visceral organ malformations and lower fetal body weights. In the fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, PF-06651600-related higher incidence of preimplantation loss was noted in non-dosed females mated with males administered PF-06651600, without effects on sperm or other features of male reproduction. When PF-06651600 was administered to healthy women together with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, the level of ethinyl estradiol in the blood was decreased; the clinical significance of this decrease is unknown, however the efficacy of estrogen-containing contraceptives may be decreased. It is not known whether PF-06651600 is secreted into human milk. Because of the above and the investigational nature of PF-06651600, it should not be administered to pregnant women, breastfeeding women, or fertile women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use contraception as defined in the study protocol. Men in the study are not required to use birth control because PF-06651600 is not likely to transfer to a partner through semen at pharmacologically relevant blood levels. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of PF-06651600 may be found in the IB, which is the single reference safety document (SRSD) for this study. 2.3.1. Risk Assessment 3. OBJECTIVES, ESTIMANDS AND ENDPOINTS Objectives Endpoints 4. STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design Study B7981037 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled safety study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF-06651600, including the assessment of BAEP and IENF, in adults with ≥25% scalp hair loss due to AA. Approximately 60 adults 18 to 50 years of age will be randomized 1:1 to receive either PF-06651600 or placebo. If there are issues related to the integrity of some peripheral nerve punch biopsy samples, up to an additional 20 participants may be added at the discretion of the Sponsor to ensure adequate numbers of participants with interpretable biopsies. The total duration of participation in the study will be approximately 26 months. This includes up to a 5-week screening period, a 9-month placebo-controlled treatment phase, a 15-month active therapy extension phase, and a 4-week follow-up period (See Schema). Screening will occur within 35 days prior to Day 1 of the study to confirm that selection criteria for the study are met. At Month 9, the placebo-controlled phase will end, and all participants may enter the active therapy extension phase of the study and receive PF- 06651600. For any participant discontinued for a neurological or auditory adverse event, the participant will be evaluated again at 6 months after discontinuation; the maximum duration of participation in the study for such participants could be approximately 32 months if the event occurred at the last visit. At Month 6, any participant with a baseline overall SALT score ≤75 will have the option to enter the active therapy extension phase if their overall SALT score at Month 6 has increased from baseline by ≥25 points. Those participants who enter the active therapy extension phase at Month 6 are to complete at that visit all the Month 6 (Visit 5) assessments and then follow the schedule of visits in the active therapy extension phase starting with Month 3E skipping the Month 9 (Visit 6). BAEPs will be measured at screening and at Months 6, 9, 9E, and 15E, or early termination for all participants. IENF will be assessed at Day 1, Month 9, and Month 15E, or early termination. Participants who enter the active therapy extension phase at Month 6 will have a skin punch biopsy taken at Month 6 for IENF assessments instead of at Month 9. The skin biopsy must be collected before the start of Active Therapy Extension Phase. Participants who discontinue the study due to a neurological or auditory AE will have assessments performed at the time of discontinuation and repeated at 6 months after the last dose of study intervention (see Section 10.7). 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design Because the dog toxicity study BAEP finding was considered a central auditory effect, BAEP interwave I-V latency will be the primary endpoint for this study, since generally, the interwave latencies are used for diagnosis of brainstem effect in humans.(45) High-intensity stimulation (eg, 80dB) is used in humans for differential diagnosis of cochlear versus retro- cochlear lesions.(45) The total duration of the study is approximately 26 months, though this could be longer for any participant who discontinues due to a neurological or auditory AE and needs to return for follow-up in 6 months. This includes a 9-month placebo-controlled phase that will evaluate the effect of PF-06651600 during the same time frame in which axonal dystrophy was observed in the 9-month dog toxicity study (ie, axonal dystrophy in the dog studies presented at 9 months and a functional correlate [BAEP threshold and waveform abnormality] was evident at 7 and 9 months). Following the placebo-controlled phase, there will be a 15-month active therapy extension phase. The extension phase is included to collect longer-term safety information. In this study, BAEP will be measured at screening, 6 months, 9 months (the end of the placebo-controlled phase), Month 9E, and Month 15E or end of treatment for early discontinuation and potentially at a 6-Month Follow-Up. The timepoints for BAEP were chosen for the placebo-controlled phase based on the timing of findings in the dog toxicity study. The additional 2 measurements during the active therapy extension phase are intended to provide longer-term assessment. Axonal dystrophy and IENFD will be evaluated in peripheral skin biopsies. The technique allows direct assessments of both morphological features (such as axonal dystrophy) as well as IENFD in nerve endings.(46-48) IENFD directly evaluates the loss of axons (as an index of axonal degeneration) and its assessment in peripheral skin punch biopsies is an established technique used in clinical evaluations of patients with peripheral neuropathies. For example, an IENFD study evaluating the structural and functional integrity of small autonomic nerve fibers in E46KSNCA (a biomarker for an aggressive Lewy body brain disease), carriers showed small fiber neurodegeneration in the skin. In another study, distal leg IENFD was study of patients with diabetic small fiber neuropathy, impaired glucose tolerance neuropathy and idiopathic small fiber neuropathy, IENFD loss was seen at three sites (proximal thigh, distal thigh, distal leg) whereas there was no significant change in IENFD in healthy controls over 2 to 3 years.(50) The distal part of lower extremities will be selected for skin punch biopsies because distal portions of long axons are typically more susceptible to axonal dystrophy than proximal portions. Axonal dystrophy and IENFD will be measured at Day 1, Month 9, Month 15E, or end of treatment for early discontinuation and potentially at 6-Month Follow-Up, reflecting the timing of findings in the dog toxicity studies and for longer-term assessment. Inclusion of patients with ≥25% scalp hair loss due to AA, which the investigator has additionally determined to be appropriate for systemic therapy, is considered to be justified. The threshold of ≥25% scalp hair loss due to AA is also currently being used in the long-term safety study B7981032. While there is not a generally accepted definition of mild, moderate and severe AA, interviews of dermatologists and patients with an AA history of ≥50% scalp hair loss indicated that scalp hair loss >20% represents moderate to severe hair loss.(51) 4.3. Justification for Dose This study will evaluate PF-06651600 administered at a dose of 200 mg QD for 4 weeks followed by a dose of 50 mg QD for up to 24 months. This dose regimen was selected as it is the highest dose regimen being evaluated in the Phase 3 development program in AA. Exposure margins of the proposed clinical doses relative to the nonclinical NOAEL exposures are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. PF-06651600 Exposure Margins and No Observed Adverse Effects Level Abbreviations: AUC = area under the concentration-time curve; NOAEL = no observed adverse effect level; QD = once daily. 4.4. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including the follow-up visit. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study. 5. STUDY POPULATION This study can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate participants are enrolled. The following eligibility criteria are designed to select participants for whom participation in the study is considered appropriate. All relevant medical and nonmedical conditions should be taken into consideration when deciding whether a particular participant is suitable for this protocol. Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. 5.1. Inclusion Criteria Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply: Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics 1. Participants must meet the following AA criteria:  Have a clinical diagnosis of AA. Other etiologies of hair loss coexistent with AA are allowed.  ≥25% scalp hair loss due to AA (including AT and AU) measured by SALT at screening which, in the opinion of the investigator, is appropriate for systemic therapy.  Hair loss must be carefully reviewed to verify that ≥25% terminal scalp hair loss is due to AA (ie, SALT [AA] score is ≥25). If in cases of concomitant AA and other etiologies of alopecia, it cannot be verified that SALT (AA) score is ≥25, then the participant must be excluded from the study. Hearing and Neurological Assessments at Screening 2. Participants must have normal hearing and BAEP assessed by the audiology professional and confirmed by the central reader. 3. Participants must have a normal neurological examination by a neurologist and absence of peripheral neuropathy by history, symptoms, and the neuropathy assessment. Participants with stable unilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or stable unilateral ulnar entrapment on neurological examination or history are allowed in the study. Age 4. All participants must be 18 to 50 years of age at the time they sign the informed consent. Sex 5. Male or Female Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies. The study protocol requirements regarding contraception are as follows: a. Male participants: No contraceptive measures required. b. Female participants:  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:  Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), See Section 10.4. OR  Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective, with a failure rate of <1%, as described in Section 10.4 during the intervention period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study intervention. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention.  A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive (Section 10.2) pregnancy test (urine or serum as required by local regulations) at screening and at the Day 1 visit before the first dose of study intervention.  If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.  The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy. Informed Consent 6. All participants must be capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Section 10.1 which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed 7. All participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures. Prior/Concomitant Therapy 8. If receiving permitted concomitant medications, participants should be on a stable regimen, which is defined as not starting a new drug or changing dosage within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1.

Infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C viruses according to protocol-specific testing algorithm. a. For hepatitis B, participants will undergo testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). Participants who are HBsAg positive will not be eligible for this study. Participants who are HBsAg negative but HBcAb positive will be reflex tested for hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb). Additional reflex testing for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBVDNA) is also required for participants who are HBsAg negative and HBcAb positive in countries in which hepatitis B prevalence has been reported at a rate of >5.0% or if required by local standard of care. Please refer to Section 8.2.10.3 and Section 10.6 for testing algorithm, reflex testing, and full eligibility criteria. b. For hepatitis C, all participants will undergo testing for hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb) during screening. Participants who are HCVAb positive will be reflex-tested for hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA). Participants who are HCVAb and HCV RNA positive are not eligible for the study. 21. Have evidence of untreated or inadequately treated active or latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection as evidenced by the following: a. A positive QuantiFERON® TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-G) or positive or borderline T-SPOT®.TB (T-Spot test) performed within the 3 months prior to Day 1 (Visit 2). If the laboratory reports the test as indeterminate, the test should be repeated. If the result of the repeat test is indeterminate, a purified protein derivative (PPD) test may be substituted for the QFT-G test or T-Spot test only with approval from the Pfizer Medical Monitor on a case-by-case basis. b. Chest radiograph (CXR) (posterior-anterior and lateral views are recommended; however local guidelines should be followed) (Section 8.2.3) or other appropriate diagnostic imaging such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with changes suggestive of active TB infection within 3 months prior to Screening. Chest radiograph should be performed according to local standards of care or country specific guidelines. c. History of either untreated or inadequately treated latent or active TB infection. If a participant has previously received an adequate course of therapy for either latent (9 months of isoniazid (INH) in a locale where rates of primary multi-drug resistant TB infection are <5% or an acceptable alternative regimen) or active (acceptable multi-drug regimen) TB infection, neither a QFT-G test, a T-Spot test, nor a PPD test need be obtained. Details of the previous course of therapy (eg, medication(s) used, dose, duration of therapy) should be documented in the source documentation. A chest radiograph (ie, CXR or other appropriate diagnostic imaging such as computed tomography or MRI) must be obtained at screening if not done within the 3 months prior to screening (see Section 8.2.3). To be considered eligible for the study, the chest radiograph must be negative for active TB infection. A participant who is currently being treated for active or latent TB infection must be excluded from the study. Prohibited Prior/Concomitant Therapy 22.

Total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN; participants with Gilbert’s syndrome would be eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin is ≤ULN; h. In the opinion of the investigator or Pfizer (or designee), have any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that could affect interpretation of study data or the participant’s participation in the study. Other Exclusions 27. Investigator site staff members or Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the study, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, and their respective family members. 28. Have history of alcohol or substance abuse. 29. Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 8 weeks prior to Day 1. 5.3. Lifestyle Considerations 5.3.1. Contraception Participants who are WOCBP must agree to use one highly effective method of contraception (as specified in Section 10.4), as applicable. The investigator or his/her designee, in consultation with the participant, will confirm that the participant has selected an appropriate method of contraception for the individual participant from the permitted list of contraception methods (See Section 10.4), and will confirm that the participant has been instructed in its consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3), the investigator or designee will inform the participant of the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document the conversation and the participant’s affirmation in the participant’s chart (participants need to affirm their the investigator or designee will instruct the participant to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the participant or partner. 5.3.2. Meals and Dietary Restrictions On study visit days when lipid panel will be collected (see the SoA [Section 1.3]), participants must comply with fasting requirements for at least 8 hours prior to the visit. Water and permitted non-study medications are allowed (see Section 6.5.1). Participants must agree not to drink tonic water during the study. 5.3.3. Caffeine and Tobacco Participants will abstain from using tobacco products or ingesting caffeine- or xanthine- containing products (eg, coffee, tea, cola drinks, and chocolate) for at least 30 minutes before pulse rate and blood pressure measurements. 5.3.4. Elective Surgery During the study, no elective surgery should occur without first consulting with the sponsor. Preferably, elective surgery should occur before the study or be delayed until participation in the study is completed. Participants who require elective surgery should temporarily discontinue study intervention for one week prior to the surgical procedure and remain off study intervention after the surgical procedure until sutures/staples are removed. If absorbing sutures or chemical closure methods are utilized, study intervention can be resumed when the operative site is sufficiently healed, and risk of infection is minimal. Per Section 6.4, if the participant interrupts study intervention for >14 consecutive days, this must be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study. Refer to Section 6.5.4 for additional guidance regarding surgeries. 5.4. Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomly assigned to study intervention. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE). Screening laboratory tests with abnormal results may be repeated to confirm abnormal results (with the same screening number); the last value will be used to determine eligibility. If results return to normal within the 5-week screening period, the participant may enter the study upon discussion with, and agreement by, the sponsor. Participants who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened (with a new screening number) following an agreement with the sponsor. 6. STUDY INTERVENTION Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, medical device(s), or study procedure(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol. 6.1. Study Intervention(s) Administered In both the placebo-controlled phase and active therapy extension phase, each participant will receive a total of 4 tablets QD during the initial 4-week period and a total of 1 tablet QD during the remainder of that study phase. To maintain blinding, participants who received PF-06651600 during the placebo-controlled phase will receive 1 tablet QD of PF-06651600 and 3 tablets of placebo QD for a total of 4 tablets QD during the initial 4-week period of the active therapy extension phase. Intervention PF-06651600 PF-06651600 Not applicable PF-06651600 Active Therapy Extension Phase Abbreviation: QD = once daily Participants will swallow the study intervention whole and will not manipulate or chew the study intervention prior to swallowing. 6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  The study intervention will be dispensed using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) management system at each visit as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). At the Month 1 visit, the participant will return the package containing the study intervention which was dispensed at the Day 1 visit for accountability.  A qualified staff member will dispense the study intervention via unique container numbers on the blister cards provided. The participant should be instructed to maintain the product in the blister cards provided throughout the course of dosing and return the blister cards to the site at the next study visit. Site staff will instruct participants on the proper storage requirements for study intervention that is taken home.  The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study intervention must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. At a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations must be documented and available upon request. Data for nonworking days must indicate the minimum and maximum temperatures since previously documented for all site storage locations upon return to business. Any excursions from the study intervention label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery along with any actions taken. The site should actively pursue options for returning the study intervention to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Once an excursion is identified, the study intervention must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the study intervention. Specific details regarding the definition of an excursion and information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site in the IP Manual. Study interventions should be stored in their original containers. Site staff will instruct participants on the proper storage requirements for take-home study intervention. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). such as the Investigational Product Accountability Log or sponsor-approved equivalent. All study interventions will be accounted for using a study intervention accountability form/record. All study intervention that is taken home by the participant, both used and unused, must be returned to the investigator by the participant. Returned study intervention must not be redispensed to the participants. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are provided in the IP Manual. All destruction must be adequately documented. If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Pfizer. Upon identification of a product complaint, notify the sponsor within 1 business day of discovery as described in the IP Manual. 6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing A qualified staff member will dispense the study intervention using the IRT system via unique container numbers in the blister cards provided, in quantities appropriate according to the SoA (Section 1.3). A second staff member will verify the dispensing. The participant should be instructed to maintain the product in the blister cards provided throughout the course of dosing and return the blister cards to the site at the next study visit. At the EOP visit (Month 6 or Month 9/EOP, as appropriate), additional double-blind therapy may be dispensed if the neurological and/or audiological/BAEP assessments (including the central read confirmation and any repeat assessments if deemed necessary by the central reader) are not yet completed. Additional double-blind therapy would be dispensed as a 32- day supply, but dosing may not extend past the end of the +21 day EOP visit window. Once neurological and audiological/BAEP EOP assessments are complete, active-therapy may be dispensed either on site or by shipping to the study participant. 6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system. 6.4. Study Intervention Compliance Participant compliance with study intervention will be assessed at each visit during the Intervention Period. Compliance with the dosing of study intervention will be verified by delegated site personnel through a combination of counting returned tablets and discussion with the participant, which will be documented in the source documents. Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). When study intervention is administered at the clinic, it will be administered by the appropriately designated staff at the investigator site. Participants should take the tablets orally according to the dosing instructions provided with the study intervention. Participants will be encouraged to take the study intervention in the morning whenever possible. Participants should take the study intervention at approximately the same time every day. However, for study visit days, participants are to be instructed to refrain from dosing at home and are to take the dose in the clinic. If a dose is missed and the interval to the next dose is <8 hours, the missed dose should not be administered. If a dose is missed and the interval to the next dose is 8 hours, the missed dose should be administered. The study intervention may be temporarily withheld for a maximum of 14 consecutive days at the discretion of the investigator. Participants interrupting study intervention for >14 consecutive days for any reason must be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study. For participants who are considering elective surgery refer to Section 5.3.4 regarding information on temporary withholding of study intervention for elective surgery. If compliance is <80%, the investigator or designee is to counsel the participant and ensure steps are taken to improve compliance. If the participant is over-compliant (>120%) with study intervention (intentional or accidental), the investigator or designee is to counsel the participant and ensure correct understanding of the study intervention dosing regimen. The investigator should contact the Pfizer Study Clinician promptly with any over-compliance that may potentially impact the safe use of study intervention or that may result in a SAE. 6.5. Concomitant Therapy Medications/treatments that are taken in the screening period (after informed consent is obtained and before the first dose of study intervention) as well as any medications/treatments taken for the treatment of AA at any time prior to the screening visit will be documented as prior medications/treatments. Medications/treatments taken after the first dose of study intervention has been administered will be documented as concomitant medications/treatments.Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded along with:  Reason for use  Dates of administration including start and end dates  Dosage information including dose and frequency The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy. 6.5.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications For the purposes of this protocol, dietary supplements are defined as vitamins, minerals, and purified food substances with pharmaceutical properties. Vitamins, minerals, and purified food substances are allowed in amounts not known to be associated with adverse effects (such as hypervitaminosis). With the exception of medications prohibited for use in Section 5.2, CYP3A inhibitors are permitted to be used during the study. Sensitive and moderate sensitive CYP3A substrates permitted to be used during the study are listed in Section 10.8. A participant who is receiving a permitted concomitant medication for any reason must be on a locally-approved medication and dose for the treated indication, and this must be documented on the case report form (CRF). Acetaminophen/paracetamol is allowed if dosed no more than 3.0 g/day for no more than 5 consecutive days. Participants are not allowed any other investigational drugs or treatments during the study. Participants should refrain from starting new or changing doses of permitted prescription or non-prescription drugs, vitamins, and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1 and prior to study visits throughout the study, unless otherwise noted below. Participants should report any changes to permitted medications during the study to the investigator as soon as they occur. Medication changes must be documented in the participant’s record and CRF. Unless a prohibited medication or treatment, participants may be administered any other medications necessary for the treatment of concomitant medical disorders as deemed necessary by the treating physician. Following Day 1, addition of concomitant medications or any change in the dosage should be limited to those considered medically essential. 6.5.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications Participants will abstain from all prohibited medications as described in Section 5.2 and Section 10.8. Medically necessary medications should not be discontinued without prior evaluation of acceptable alternatives, including consultation with prescribing health professional. Participants should be instructed at each visit to contact the study site investigator promptly if there are any intended changes or additions to concomitant medications. All medications and treatments that could affect AA must be discontinued. During the study, if it is discovered that a subject has been taking a medication or treatment that could affect AA, the investigator should contact the Sponsor for each case to determine whether the subject must be discontinued. Participants must also avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and avoid the use of tanning booths, sun lamps or other ultraviolet light sources during the study. 6.5.3. Vaccinations Vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine is prohibited within the 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study intervention, during the study, and for 6 weeks following discontinuation of study drug. Vaccines (including COVID-19 vaccines) that are not live attenuated are permitted. Similarly, current routine household contact with individuals who have been vaccinated with live attenuated vaccine must be avoided during study treatment and for 6 weeks following completion of study treatment. Following vaccination with live attenuated vaccine, the virus may be shed in bodily fluids, including stool, and there is a potential risk that the virus may be transmitted. Such vaccines include but are not limited to: FluMist (intranasal influenza vaccine), attenuated rotavirus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, attenuated typhoid fever vaccine, oral polio vaccine, MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, vaccinia (smallpox) vaccine, and Zostavax (zoster vaccine live). 6.5.4. Surgery During the study, no elective surgery should occur without first consulting with the Pfizer Medical Monitor or designee. Preferably, elective surgery should occur before the study or be delayed until participation in the study is completed. Refer to Section 5.3.4 for guidelines regarding temporary withholding of study intervention prior to and after elective surgery. The Pfizer Medical Monitor or designee should be notified if a participant requires surgery (including dental surgery) during the study to determine whether the participant should discontinue from the study and/or discontinue study intervention prior to the surgical procedure. The Pfizer Medical Monitor or designee should be notified as soon as possible if a participant undergoes a surgical procedure without first informing the study staff. 6.6. Dose Modification Dose modification of the study intervention is not permitted in this study. For information on temporary withholding of study intervention (see Section 6.4). 6.7. Intervention after the End of the Study There is no intervention required by the protocol following the end of the study. 7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study intervention (ie, definitive discontinuation). Reasons for definitive discontinuation of study intervention include the following: treatment-related SAEs, serious infections, and other events as described in Section 10.7. Note that discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study. If study intervention is definitively discontinued, the participant will remain in the study to be evaluated for the assessments at the Early Termination (ET) and Follow-up visits (per the discontinuation of study intervention and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. In the event of discontinuation of study intervention, it must be documented on the appropriate CRF/in the medical records whether the participant is discontinuing further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures, posttreatment study follow-up, and/or future collection of additional information. Refer to Section 10.7 for discontinuation criteria. 7.1.1. Temporary Discontinuation See Section 5.3.4 and Section 6.4. 7.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request. Reasons for discontinuation from the study include the following:  Refused further follow-up;  Lost to follow-up;  Death;  Study terminated by sponsor; At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit should be conducted. See the SoA (Section 1.3) for assessments to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. The early discontinuation visit applies only to participants who are enrolled/randomized and then are prematurely withdrawn from the study. Participants should be questioned regarding their reason for withdrawal. If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any remaining samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document any such requests in the site study records and notify the sponsor accordingly. If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent (see Section 7.2.1) for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early termination procedures will not be viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant’s safety was preserved. 7.2.1. Withdrawal of Consent Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study intervention will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol-specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. Participants should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment study follow-up and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law. 7.3. Lost to Follow up A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 1.3). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  Safety issues should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention.  Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA (Section 1.3), is essential and required for study conduct.  All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICD may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Participants will have up to 35 days of a screening period prior to the first dose of study intervention to confirm that they meet the participant selection criteria for the study.  The investigator (or appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and dated ICD before performing any study-specific procedures. The ICD is signed and dated by each participant in accordance with the procedures described in Section 10.1.3.  Due to audiological and neurologic evaluations and possible need for tuberculin testing and chest radiograph, screening procedures may be performed over more than 1 visit within the 35 days prior to the Day 1 visit.  To assure consistency and reduce variability, visits should occur at approximately the same time of day throughout the study. Participants should be encouraged to attend visits in the morning and prior to the participant’s dosing of study intervention as participants will receive their dose at the clinic during their study visit.  Urine pregnancy test must be performed at each visit (and must be negative) prior to dosing with the study intervention for female participants of childbearing potential through follow-up (see Section 10.4 and Section 8.2.13).  The patient-reported outcome assessment should be completed before the other evaluations or treatments at all of the visits (when patient reported outcome assessments are to be administered) when possible. Vital signs and ECGs should be performed before any laboratory blood collection. All other evaluations (unless noted otherwise) do not need to be performed in any specific order.  Participants are required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to all visits that include fasting lipid profile panel testing. During the fasting period, participants should refrain from all food and liquids (water and medications other than study intervention are permitted).  Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol-required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the participant. When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for the missed test and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely manner.  For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study.  The total amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the 2-year study, including all assessments at the screening and follow-up visits, will be approximately 200 mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 550 mL during any period of 60 consecutive days.  Refer to Section 10.7 for guidelines on participant safety monitoring and discontinuation. 8.1. Efficacy Assessments 8.1.1. Rater Qualifications Diagnosis of AA must be performed by a qualified dermatologist (board certified or equivalent) who has experience with AA. An experienced and qualified physician or healthcare professional may be permitted to perform the clinical evaluations of alopecia (ie, SALT). For all assessments, the rater must be formally delegated to perform this assessment by the PI and receive training (with proper documentation) on the protocol and applicable assessment scales prior to performing these evaluations. To assure consistency and reduce variability, the same rater should assess dermatological clinical evaluations for a given procedure and for an individual participant throughout the study (eg, one rater performs all SALT evaluations throughout the study). A back-up experienced and qualified, protocol-trained rater will only be allowed in special situations when the designated rater is unable to perform the evaluation. Use of the back-up rater will be documented. 8.1.2. Clinical Assessments 8.1.2.1. Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) SALT is a quantitative assessment of AA severity based on scalp terminal hair loss.(52) Scalp hair loss due to AA (AA SALT score) is measured at screening. The overall SALT score, which does not distinguish the reason for hair loss, will be collected at visits shown in the SoA (Section 1.3). Score parameters utilize a visual aid showing the division of the scalp hair into four quadrants (back, top of scalp, and both sides), with each of the four quadrants given an accurate determination of the % of scalp surface area covered, representing 24%, 40%, 18%, and 18% of the total scalp surface area, respectively. Hair prosthetics (eg, wigs, hair extensions) must be removed for clinical assessments of AA at all study visits. 8.1.2.1.1. Non-AA SALT Score In addition to the overall amount of scalp terminal hair loss, scalp hair loss due to etiologies other than AA will be assessed using the SALT tool. This will only be collected for participants known to have scalp hair loss due to other etiologies in addition to AA. The non- AA SALT score will be collected at visits shown in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.1.2.1.2. Alopecia Areata Eligibility Assessment In addition to the overall amount of scalp terminal hair loss (overall SALT), scalp hair loss due to AA (AA SALT) will be assessed at the screening visit to verify eligibility of participants. 8.1.3. Patient Reported Outcomes 8.1.3.1. Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) The PGI-C asks the participant to evaluate the improvement or worsening of their AA as compared to the start of the study using a single-item, “Since the start of the study, my alopecia areata has: …”. The participants will select one of seven responses ranging from “greatly improved” to “greatly worsened”. 8.2. Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3). Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety issues. Unscheduled visits, physical exams, or other study assessments may also be conducted at any time during the study to assess perceived safety issues. Safety monitoring and discontinuation criteria are provided in Section 10.7. For the purposes of safety monitoring and discontinuation, baseline values will be defined as follows:  Baseline values will be defined as the last non-missing values collected before dosing on Day 1 for all participants. 8.2.1. Medical History, Physical Examinations, Height and Weight  Complete AA disease history includes collection of details of AA at screening: AA history, AA diagnosis, number of years of current episode of hair loss, pattern of scalp hair loss, body hair loss, the use of topical treatments, systemic treatments and other treatments for AA. Note: Initiation of the current episode should be the last occurrence when the patient had substantial scalp hair (regardless of whether that hair growth occurred spontaneously or was the result of interventional treatment) prior to scalp hair loss.  Medical history, including, but not limited to, comorbid conditions, history of drug, alcohol, tobacco use, dermatologic, auditory, and neurologic history, and infection history will be collected at screening and/or Day 1 (as applicable per the SoA [Section 1.3]) Refer to the CRF completion guidelines for specific information regarding medical history information to be collected for each group of participants.  Smoking status and average weekly alcohol consumption (units/week) will also be collected for all participants.  Height and weight will be measured without the participant wearing shoes or outerwear. Height (in or cm) and weight (lb or kg) will be measured and recorded in the source document at various time points according to the SoA (Section 1.3).  Complete physical examinations must be performed by the investigator, sub investigator or a qualified health professional per local guidelines. Complete physical examinations consist of assessments of general appearance; skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT); mouth, heart; lungs; abdomen; extremities; neurologic and auditory function; back; and lymph nodes. In addition, dermatological full body exam must be performed by the investigator, sub- investigator, or a qualified health professional per local guidelines. Dermatological examinations should also include visual inspection of the breasts and external genitalia.  Targeted physical examinations must be performed by the investigator, sub-investigator or a qualified health professional per local guidelines and should include skin, heart, lung, and abdomen, neurologic and auditory function, and examination of body systems where there are symptom complaints by the participant.  When dermatologic adverse events are identified on physical exam, additional procedures may be required. Please refer to Section 8.2.9.2 for additional details. 8.2.2. Vital Signs  Oral, tympanic, or axillary temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure will be assessed. It is preferred that body temperature be collected using the tympanic or oral methods; however, the axillary method is also permitted. The same method should be used consistently throughout the study. Vital signs should be performed before laboratory blood collection and ECG.  Blood pressure (BP) and pulse measurements will be assessed in a chair, back supported and arms bared (free of restrictions such as rolled-up sleeves, etc.) and supported at heart level. Measurements should be taken on the same arm at each visit (preferably non-dominant) with a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. BP will be measured using a standard calibrated blood pressure measuring device. A BP device that uses multiple cuff sizes based on the arm circumference is the required type of device. The appropriate cuff size for the participant must be used to ensure accurate measurement. The arm circumference at the midpoint of the length of the upper arm should be measured to determine the appropriate cuff size in accordance with the specifications of the BP measuring device. The same properly sized and calibrated BP cuff should be used to measure BP each time.  Pulse rate should be measured at approximately the same time as BP for a minimum of 30 seconds.  BP and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones).  Participants should refrain from smoking or ingesting caffeine during the 30 minutes preceding the measurements. 8.2.3. Chest Radiography CXR (posterior-anterior and lateral views are recommended; however local guidelines should be followed) or other appropriate diagnostic image (ie, computed tomography or MRI) must be taken at screening or within 3 months prior to screening visit for all participants. The chest radiograph must be read by a qualified radiologist or pulmonologist prior to the Day 1 visit for confirmation of eligibility per Section 5.2. Documentation of the reading by the qualified radiologist or pulmonologist must available in the source documentation. 8.2.4. Electrocardiograms  Single 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QT intervals (or using an ECG machine which does not automatically cF calculate QT intervals, with the site’s qualified medical personnel performing the cF calculation with the QT calculator provided by the sponsor). Refer to Section 10.7 cF for QT withdrawal criteria and any additional QT readings that may be cF cF necessary.  ECG should be performed before laboratory blood collection.  All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the participant has rested quietly for at least 10 minutes in a supine position and prior to any blood collection.  A paper or digital copy of the ECG should be filed in the participant’s chart and must be available to the sponsor upon request.  To ensure safety of the participants, qualified medical personnel will review all ECGs and make comparisons to the baseline measurements as defined in Section 8.2. Any clinically significant changes will be recorded and evaluated further, as clinically warranted. In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality.  ECG values of potential clinical concern are listed in Section 10.7. 8.2.5. Neurological Examination Neurological examination must be performed by a qualified (board certified or equivalent) neurologist and will include a general neurological evaluation and a neuropathy assessment. The neuropathy assessment will assess for symptoms and signs of neuropathy. Refer to the Manuals for General Neurological and Neuropathy Assessments for additional details. The neurologist may recommend additional evaluations and / or additional visits. They may also identify additional medical history or adverse events that need to be added to the CRF. Additionally, at any time, participants with clinically meaningful changes from baseline in neurologic signs or symptoms should be documented in the CRF, and the monitor and sponsor study clinician should be notified. The same neurologist should perform examinations on individual participants throughout the study. See Section 10.7 for follow-up assessment of participants who discontinue due to a neurological AE. 8.2.6. Audiological Evaluations All participants will have an audiological evaluation at times specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). When possible, the participant should have the evaluation performed by the same audiology professional, at the same evaluation center using the same equipment during the study. In countries where licensed and certified audiologists are available, they are the recommended specialists for study-related audiometric testing and its clinical interpretation. In those countries in which an audiologist is not a licensed and certified specialty to interpret and manage audiometric test results, clinical interpretation should be performed by an appropriate specialist licensed and certified to interpret and manage audiometric test results (eg, otolaryngologist), while the actual audiometric testing procedure can be performed by a trained technician or equivalent who is able to perform all required tests. Participants must have a full audiological assessment completed during screening prior to Day 1. Audiology and BAEP evaluations should be done on the same day, with audiology assessment first. If they cannot be done on the same day, assessments must be within 7 days of each other. This evaluation includes audiological history, otoscopic examination, pure tone audiometry (air and bone conduction), speech audiometry, and immittance audiometry. All screening audiological evaluation results must be available prior to Day 1 to assess eligibility for all participants. At subsequent visits, the audiological assessments will be repeated including updated audiological history, otoscopic examination, pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and immittance audiometry for all participants; based upon results, additional audiological assessments may be required. For participants who terminate early from the study, the audiological evaluation should be performed. If there is a clinically meaningful, treatment-emergent decline in auditory function from the screening measurements, the participant must be promptly evaluated by an audiology professional to assess for possible causes. Evaluation results should then be discussed with the sponsor to determine if the participant should be discontinued from the study. Discontinued participants must be followed up off-treatment with appropriate testing at regular intervals, until hearing recovers or is determined to be clinically stable. See Section 10.7 for follow-up assessment of participants who discontinue due to an auditory event. The central reader will review the audiology results for each applicable visit. Refer to the most current version of the Audiology Study Guide for details on audiological evaluation. 8.2.7. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential Evaluations All participants will have a BAEP evaluation, as specified in the Manual for BAEP Evaluation, at the times specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). When possible, the participant should have the evaluations performed at the same evaluation center, by the same audiology professional using the same equipment, during the study. Audiology and BAEP evaluations should be done on the same day, with audiology assessment first. If they cannot be done on the same day, assessments must be within 7 days of each other. A central reader will be used for BAEP to confirm that locally read BAEP waves were labelled appropriately and at their peak so that latency and amplitude data are accurate. Central reading will also ensure consistency in BAEP interpretation. The BAEP recording may be repeated (including additional recordings with modified parameters) or the original recording may be reassessed based on feedback from the central reader. Only results confirmed by the central reader as accurately interpreted will be used for analysis. For participants who terminate early from the study, the BAEP evaluation should be performed. For follow-up assessment of participants who discontinue due to an auditory adverse event see Section 10.7. Refer to the most current version of the Manual for BAEP Evaluation for details on BAEP evaluation. 8.2.8. Skin Punch Biopsy, Evaluation of IENFD and Axonal Dystrophy 8.2.8.1. Skin Punch Biopsy All participants will have skin punch biopsies performed at times specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). The participant should have the biopsies performed at the same center during the study. Refer to the most current version of the Central Laboratory Manual for details on the skin punch biopsy procedure. See Section 10.7 for follow-up assessment of participants who discontinue due to a neurological adverse event. 8.2.8.2. Histology for Axonal Dystrophy and IENFD This will be performed by a central reader. 8.2.9. Special Safety Assessment 8.2.9.1. Suspected Opportunistic Infections In the event of a suspected opportunistic infection, every effort should be made to identify the pathogen utilizing laboratory or other methods appropriate to the clinical situation. 8.2.9.2. Dermatological Events All participants will have a dermatological full body exam as noted in the SoA (Section 1.3). Guidelines for the assessment of herpetiform rash and drug-related rash are noted in Section 8.2.9.1 and Section 8.2.9.2.2, respectively. 8.2.9.2.1. Herpetiform Rash For any occurrence of a suspected herpetiform rash (eg, herpes zoster or herpes simplex) or eczema herpeticum, specimens for viral DNA analysis will be obtained: a swab of the affected area will be collected for confirmation. Details for this collection will be provided in the laboratory manual. 8.2.9.2.2. Drug-Related Rash All potential drug-related reports of rash will be followed up until resolution or clinically stable or in agreement with the sponsor. All events of rash should be treated according to international and local guidelines for the treatment of rash, eg, where appropriate, topical corticosteroids and/or agents such as antibiotics or antivirals could be prescribed. All participants reporting an unexplained skin rash should undergo a formal comprehensive dermatologic evaluation. In addition, the participant will be asked to rate the severity of pruritus within the last 24 hours on a scale from 0 (No itching) to 10 (Worst possible itching). A 4 mm punch biopsy will be taken unless there is a clear, non-drug related etiology (eg, infection, including herpes virus, pre-existing condition) or other clinical rationale (eg, if the rash is present on the face, it may not be appropriate to take a biopsy) or participant refuses to have biopsy performed. The biopsy will be sent to the local laboratory for histological investigation of the rash in order to gain insight into potential etiology of the rash. In addition to a biopsy of suspected drug-related rash, a swab (for microbiological assessment) of the affected area will also be taken for culture and sensitivity to assess (at the local laboratory) for any bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens, if applicable. Photographs of the rash will be taken when possible. Detailed procedures to assure photographic quality and consistency will be provided separately in a photography instruction manual. Within 30 days of receipt, the principal investigator (PI) should forward all de-identified biopsy results, culture results, photographs, and any additional relevant test results to the sponsor for review. Refer to the Canfield Photography User Manual for details. 8.2.10. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  See Section 10.2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA (Section 1.3) for the timing and frequency.  Participants must abstain from all food and drink (except water and non-study medications) for a minimum of 8 hours prior to fasting lipid profile panel collection according to the SoA (Section 1.3). All other labs do not require fasting.  The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition.  All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 28 days of the last dose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. o If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the sponsor notified. o All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 10.2 must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA (Section 1.3). Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety issues. o If laboratory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the CRF.  See Section 10.5 for suggested actions and follow-up assessments in the event of potential drug-induced liver injury. 8.2.10.1. Tuberculosis Testing QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-G) test is the preferred testing method; however, the T-SPOT.TB (T-Spot) test is also permitted when QFT-G is not available. The QFT-G test is an in vitro diagnostic test using a peptide cocktail simulating early secreted antigenic target of 6 kiloDalton (ESAT-6), culture filtrate protein 10 kiloDalton (CFP-10), and TB 7.7 proteins to stimulate cells in heparinized whole blood. Detection of interferon-gamma by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is used to identify in vitro responses to these peptide antigens that are associated with M. tuberculosis infection. The T-Spot test is also an in vitro diagnostic test; however, it differs in that it uses a peptide cocktail simulating ESAT-6 and CFP-10 proteins to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both the QFT-G test and the T-Spot test are indirect tests for M. tuberculosis infection (including disease) and are intended for use in conjunction with risk assessment, radiography, and other medical and diagnostic evaluations. A blood sample will be collected for either the QFT-G or the T-Spot testing. The site must determine which test will be performed as sample collection and processing guidelines differ. QFT-G testing will be performed at the central laboratory and T-Spot testing will be performed at the site’s local laboratory. Following QFT-G sample processing, the sample will be shipped to the central laboratory for testing. The procedure for processing and preparing the sample for shipment is described fully in the laboratory manual, which will be provided to investigators. In addition to TB testing as specified in this clinical protocol, a CXR will be performed as described in Section 8.2.3. 8.2.10.1.1. Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) Test If the QFT-G test or T-Spot test cannot be performed, or if the results from the reference laboratory are indeterminate, then participants may be screened using the PPD Tuberculin Test (Mantoux method), with the approval of the Pfizer Medical Monitor. Participants must have the PPD test administered and evaluated by a health care professional 48 to 72 hours later in order to be eligible for the study, unless performed and documented within the last 12 weeks. The test should be performed and interpreted as negative if induration is <5 mm. 8.2.10.1.2. Screening Tuberculosis Testing During the screening period, it must be determined and documented that participants do not have evidence of untreated or inadequately treated active or latent infection with TB per Exclusion criteria 21 in Section 5.2. The results of TB screening conducted within 3 months prior to Day 1 visit or during the screening period must be documented in study records prior to Day 1 (Visit 2). 8.2.10.1.3. Subsequent Tuberculosis Testing Subsequent (post-screening) TB testing will be conducted at the time points indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3) for all participants as described below. For participants with a negative QFT-G (or T-Spot or PPD) result during prior testing and no history of previous treatment for active or latent TB, the following testing will be conducted:  QFT-G test or T-Spot test per Section 8.2.10.1. If the laboratory reports the test as indeterminate, the test should be repeated. If the result of the repeat test is indeterminate, a purified protein derivative (PPD) test may be substituted for the QFT-G test or T-Spot test only with approval from the Pfizer Medical Monitor on a case-by-case basis.  Participants with a positive result must have a chest radiograph or other appropriate diagnostic image (ie, computed tomography or MRI) performed. The chest radiograph must be read by a qualified radiologist or pulmonologist.  Participants with a positive result must have study intervention temporarily withheld until the decision to restart treatment has been discussed and agreed with the sponsor, prior to restarting treatment. For this to happen, the participant must be evaluated, and the test result must be reviewed by a specialist (eg, pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist) to determine if the participant has active or latent TB. Participants with active or latent TB must be discontinued. If it is determined by a specialist (eg, pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist) that the participant does not have active or latent TB, the decision to restart treatment must be approved by Pfizer.  Participants with a negative laboratory result may continue in the study and do not require a chest radiograph. For participants with a history of adequate previous treatment for active or latent TB, the following testing will be conducted:  Neither a QFT-G test, T-Spot test, nor a PPD test need be obtained.  CXR or other appropriate diagnostic image (ie, computed tomography or MRI) must be performed. The chest radiograph must be read by a qualified radiologist or pulmonologist.  Participants identified as having active TB must be discontinued from the study and referred to a specialist (eg, pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist) for evaluation.  Participants with a CXR or other appropriate diagnostic image (ie, computed tomography or MRI) negative for active TB may continue in the study. 8.2.10.2. Day 1 Viral Screen A serum sample will be collected at Day 1 and submitted to the central lab for all participants. The sample will be stored and analyzed at a later date only at the sponsor’s request. In certain cases of suspected viral infection (eg, disseminated herpes zoster or varicella), the sponsor may request to analyze the sample to determine if the participant had exposure to that virus. Additional sample collection instructions and details regarding sample destruction will be provided in the lab manual. The retained samples will be destroyed upon participant completion of this study. 8.2.10.3. Hepatitis B Virus DNA (HBVDNA) Testing For participants in countries in which hepatitis B prevalence has been reported at a rate of >5.0%(53) or if required by local standard of care, HBVDNA testing will be performed as reflex testing for any participant who is positive for HBcAb at screening. In addition, HBVDNA testing will be performed according to the SoA (Section 1.3) for subjects who were enrolled with a positive HBcAb and a negative HBsAg in those regions for which hepatitis B prevalence has been reported at a rate of >5.0% or if required by local standard of care. Testing at additional time points may be performed as per the local standard of care. Please refer to Section 10.6 for the testing algorithm, reflex testing, and eligibility criteria. 8.2.11. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring 8.2.11.1. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) There are 2 versions of the C-SSRS to be utilized in this study - “C-SSRS for screening and Day 1 visits” and “C-SSRS for any visits after Day 1”(54). The version used is dictated by the actual study visit and the participant population (See the SoA [Section 1.3]). At the screening or Day 1 visits, if the participant has had suicidal ideation associated with actual intent and a method or plan in the past year (“yes” answers on items 4, 5), the participant will not be included in the study. For participants, suicidal behavior in the past year (“Yes” answer on any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C-SSRS), is exclusionary. For participants who have had previous history of suicidal behaviors in the past >1 year, (a “Yes” answer to any of the suicidal behavior items of the C-SSRS), a risk assessment must be performed and documented by a qualified mental health professional to assess whether it is safe for the participant to participate in the trial. Any participants who are not eligible due to suicidal ideation or behavior should be referred for appropriate evaluation and treatment. At any visits after Day 1, if there are “yes” answers on items 4, 5, or on any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C-SSRS, the participant will be discontinued from the study and referred to a mental health professional for appropriate evaluation and treatment. If the participant cannot be seen by a mental health professional within 24 hours, then the participant should be sent to a local emergency room for psychiatric assessment. 8.2.12. Patient Health Questionnaire – 8 Items (PHQ-8) The Patient Health Questionnaire – 8 items (PHQ-8) is a patient reported questionnaire that consists of 8 items to assess participant depression level.(55) Individuals with clinically significant depression as noted by a PHQ-8 total score ≥15 at screening must not be enrolled in the study. 8.2.13. Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy tests may be urine or serum tests but must have a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL. Pregnancy tests will be performed in WOCBP at the times listed in the SoA (Section 1.3). Following a negative pregnancy test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced, and a second negative pregnancy test result will be required at the baseline visit prior to the participant’s receiving the study intervention. In addition to pregnancy tests performed at the site, site personnel will instruct applicable participants to complete monthly urine pregnancy tests between study visits starting after the Month 1 visit through the Month 15E/EOT visit. The pregnancy testing between visits may occur outside of the study site. Urine pregnancy kits will be provided to participants at each study visit (starting at Month 1) and site personnel will instruct participants on when and how to administer the pregnancy test and how to interpret the result. The participants will be given enough kits to cover the monthly testing between visits (for example, at least 2 kits should be given at the Month 3 visit). Site personnel will be required to document the discussion, including confirmation of participant willingness to perform administered urine pregnancy test, and understanding of how to perform the test as well as how to interpret the test result. In addition, site personnel will contact participants between study visits to obtain monthly pregnancy test result and ensure this contact and the result of the pregnancy test are recorded in participant source documentation and the CRF. Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected) and at the end of the study. Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded if the serum pregnancy result is positive. In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the participant will be withdrawn from administration of study intervention but may remain in the study for follow-up. 8.2.14. Rater Qualifications For specific rating assessments, only qualified raters will be allowed to evaluate and/or rate assessment will be outlined in the Rater Assessment Manual provided to each participating site. The level of experience with the target population (or equivalent), specific scale experience (or equivalent), and certification required (if applicable) will be listed and used to determine whether a rater is approved for a given assessment. Proposed raters who do not meet specific criteria but who may be qualified based on unique circumstances may be individually reviewed by the sponsor study clinical team to determine whether or not a waiver may be issued. The rater must become certified to perform selected study assessments before he or she can participate in the conduct of the study. For specifically defined assessments, rater training and standardization exercises may be conducted, and written and signed documentation will be provided by the site for each rater’s certification. In return, each site will be provided written and signed documentation outlining each rater’s certification for specific study assessments. Recertification may be required at periodic intervals during the study. The raters who administer specific study assessments will be documented in a centralized location and all site staff who administer ratings will be verified in the site study documentation during the conduct of the study. 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Section 10.3. AE will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative). The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether the event meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7.1). Each participant will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner. In addition, the investigator may be requested by Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow-up information in an expedited fashion. 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving study intervention), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days, except as indicated below, after the last administration of the study intervention. The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving study intervention), through and including Visit Follow up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the AE or SAE or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. For participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for the collection of future information, the active collection period ends when consent is withdrawn. If a participant definitively discontinues or temporarily discontinues study intervention because of an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must be recorded on the CRF and the SAE reported using the CT SAE Report Form. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the participant has concluded study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has completed the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention, the investigator must promptly report the SAE to Pfizer using the CT SAE Report Form. 8.3.1.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period as described in Section 8.3.1.1 are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form immediately upon awareness and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section 10.3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. 8.3.1.2. Recording Non-serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF All nonserious AEs and SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period, which begins after obtaining informed consent as described in Section 8.3.1, will be recorded on the AE section of the CRF. The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed and all spontaneously reported AEs and SAEs reported by the participant. 8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. 8.3.3. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3). In general, follow-up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety. Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Section 10.3. 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives SUSARs or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the SRSD(s) for the study and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy An EDP occurs if:  A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention.  A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception.  A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental exposure during pregnancy:  A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact.  A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception. The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The initial information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy).  If EDP occurs in a participant or a participant’s partner, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. Details of the pregnancy will be collected after the start of study intervention and until 28 days after the last dose.  If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must report information to Pfizer Safety using the CT SAE Report Form and EDP Supplemental Form. Since the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported). Abnormal pregnancy outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs follows:  Spontaneous abortion, including miscarriage and missed abortion;  Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study intervention. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding An exposure during breastfeeding occurs if:  A female participant is found to be breastfeeding while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention.  A female is found to be breastfeeding while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention (ie, environmental exposure). An example of environmental exposure during breastfeeding is a female family member or healthcare provider who reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact. The investigator must report exposure during breastfeeding to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The information must be reported using the CT SAE Report Form. When exposure during breastfeeding occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study, so the information is not recorded on a CRF. However, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, a person receives unplanned direct contact with the include healthcare providers, family members, and other roles that are involved in the trial participant’s care. The investigator must report occupational exposure to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. The information must be reported using the CT SAE Report Form. Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. 8.3.6. Cardiovascular and Death Events Deaths and AEs related to cardiovascular events will be adjudicated (Section 9.6). 8.3.7. Disease-Related Events and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AEs or SAEs Not applicable. 8.3.8. Adverse Events of Special Interest Refer to Section 8.2.9 for definitions of adverse events of special interest (AESIs). All AESIs must be reported as an AE or SAE following the procedures described in Section 8.3.1 through Section 8.3.4. An AESI is to be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. In addition, an AESI that is also an SAE must be reported using the CT SAE Report Form. 8.3.8.1. Lack of Efficacy Lack of efficacy is reportable to Pfizer Safety only if associated with an SAE. 8.3.9. Medical Device Deficiencies Not applicable. 8.3.10. Medication Errors Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the study intervention by the wrong participant, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Exposures to the study intervention under study may occur in clinical trial settings, such as medication errors. Medication errors include:  Medication errors involving participant exposure to the study intervention;  Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participant. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page. In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified within 24 hours. Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, any associated AE(s), serious and non-serious, are recorded on an AE page of the CRF. Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report Form only when associated with an SAE. 8.4. Treatment of Overdose For this study, any dose of PF-06651600 greater than 800 mg within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose. There is no specific antidote or specific treatment for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating physician should: 1. Contact the Medical Monitor within 24 hours. 2. Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities for at least 5 half-lives or 28 calendar days after the overdose of PF-06651600 (whichever is longer). 3. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the CRF. 4. Overdose is reportable to Safety only when associated with a SAE. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 8.5. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study. 8.6. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study. 8.7. Genetics 8.7.1. Specified Genetics Genetics (specified analyses) are not evaluated in this study. 8.7.2. Banked Biospecimens for Genetics Banked biospecimens for genetics are not included in this study. 8.8. Biomarkers Biomarkers are not evaluated in this study. 8.8.1. Specified Gene Expression (RNA) Research Specified gene expression (RNA) research is not included in this study. 8.8.2. Specified Protein Research Specified protein research is not included in this study. 8.8.3. Specified Metabolomic Research Specified metabolomic research is not included in this study. 8.8.4. Banked Biospecimens for Biomarkers Banked biospecimens for biomarkers are not included in this study. 8.9. Immunogenicity Assessments Immunogenicity assessments are not applicable in this study. 8.10. Health Economics Not applicable: Health economic/medical resource utilization parameters are not evaluated in this study. . 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study is outlined here and further detailed in the SAP, which will be maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 9.1. Estimands and Statistical Hypotheses For the primary safety endpoint, there is no formal hypothesis testing. The analyses will focus on estimation. Summary statistics for each group with 95% confidence intervals will be provided. Estimands  Not applicable since there is no formal statistical hypothesis testing for this study. 9.2. Sample Size Determination Approximately 60 adults 18 to 50 years of age will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either the PF-06651600 200 mg QD/50 mg QD dose group or the placebo group. For the primary safety endpoint, change from baseline in I-V interwave latency on BAEP at Month 9, the published standard deviations for I-V interwave latency on BAEP range from 0.1 to 0.3 ms. Assuming the standard deviation of 0.2 ms, and assuming standard deviation of change from baseline is similar as the standard deviation of actual score, the half-width of 95% confidence interval for the group will be 0.07 ms for 30 participants per group. 9.3. Analysis Sets For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: 9.4. Statistical Analyses The statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized before database lock and will describe the participant populations to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. 9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses Efficacy data will be summarized by the treatment assignment based on efficacy population. The baseline is defined as the last measurement before the first dose in the placebo-controlled phase. The secondary endpoints for SALT include both the overall SALT and AA SALT scores. The overall SALT score includes hair loss regardless of etiology (ie, scalp hair loss due to both non-AA and AA). The non-AA SALT score only takes into account scalp hair loss other than that due to AA and is required to be assessed only at Month 9 (or Month 6 for those participants who enter the active therapy extension phase at Month 6), and the Month 15E or Early Termination visit (as appropriate). The AA SALT score at each visit will be calculated as follows using the non-AA SALT score collected at Month 9 (or Month 6) or the Early Termination visit (as appropriate for visits in the placebo-controlled phase), and non-AA SALT score collected at Month 15E or the Early Termination visit (as appropriate) will be used for visits in the active therapy extension phase:  AA SALT score = overall SALT score – non-AA SALT score. 9.4.2. Safety Analyses The safety analyses will be summarized by initial treatment group in the safety population based on observed data. The baseline is defined as the last measurement before the first dose in the placebo-controlled phase. All standard safety summary such as the incidence of safety events will be summarized by the initial treatment group for the placebo-control phase and active therapy extension phase. For initial active group, the overall summary for the whole study duration will also be provided. Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods 9.5. Interim Analyses There will be 2 analyses for this study. The primary analysis for this study will be conducted following the primary completion date (PCD) at Month 9 and after the data are cleaned and locked. The analyses through Month 24 (15E) will be performed after all participants complete the study. 9.6. Data Monitoring Committee or Other Independent Oversight Committee This study will use a data monitoring committee (DMC). The DMC is independent of the study team and includes only external members. The DMC charter describes the role of the DMC in more detail. The DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety of participants in the study according to the charter. The recommendations made by DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to the appropriate Pfizer personnel for final decision. Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of safety data, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. Independent safety adjudication committees will be used for opportunistic infections, cardiovascular events, neurological events, and malignancy events. 10.

The identification of events requiring submission to an adjudication/review committee will be made by the including opportunistic infections, cardiovascular, or malignancy events may also be identified by the Pfizer Study Team or designee during the review of participant data listings or by site monitors during routine monitoring of participant’s study records. The Pfizer Study Team or designee will notify the study site of any events should they identify. The Pfizer Study Team or designee will provide a listing of specific documents needed to support event adjudication by the Adjudication/Review Committees. Obtaining and submitting the documentation will be the responsibility of the study site. Event documentation will vary with the event requiring adjudication and may include (but not be limited to): hospital discharge summaries, operative reports, clinic notes, ECGs, diagnostic tests, pathology reports, autopsy reports and death certificate information, as applicable. 10.1.6. Dissemination of Clinical Study Data Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical study results through posting the results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with applicable local laws/regulations. In addition, Pfizer reports study results outside of the requirements of local laws/regulations pursuant to its standard operating procedures (SOPs). In all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and complete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in which the study was conducted. www.clinicaltrials.gov Pfizer posts clinical trial results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies (conducted in participants) that evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of a product, regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted. These results are submitted for posting in accordance with the format and timelines set forth by US law. EudraCT Pfizer posts clinical trial results on EudraCT for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies in accordance with the format and timelines set forth by EU requirements. www.pfizer.com Pfizer posts public disclosure synopses (Clinical Study Report [CSR] synopses in which any data that could be used to identify individual participants have been removed) on www.pfizer.com for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies at the same time the corresponding study results are posted to www.clinicaltrials.gov. Documents within marketing authorization packages/submissions Pfizer complies with the European Union Policy 0070, the proactive publication of clinical data to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) website. Clinical data, under Phase 1 of this protocol and protocol amendments, sample CRFs, and statistical methods. Clinical data, under Phase 2 of this policy, includes the publishing of individual participant data. Policy 0070 applies to new marketing authorization applications submitted via the centralized procedure since 01 January 2015 and applications for line extensions and for new indications submitted via the centralized procedure since 01 July 2015. Data Sharing Pfizer provides researchers secure access to patient-level data or full CSRs for the purposes of “bona-fide scientific research” that contribute to the scientific understanding of the disease, target, or compound class. Pfizer will make available data from these trials 24 months after study completion. Patient-level data will be anonymized in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. CSRs will have personally identifiable information redacted. Data requests are considered from qualified researchers with the appropriate competencies to perform the proposed analyses. Research teams must include a biostatistician. Data will not be provided to applicants with significant conflicts of interest, including individuals requesting access for commercial/competitive or legal purposes. 10.1.7. Data Quality Assurance  All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the CRF.  The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the CRF.  The investigator must ensure that the CRFs are securely stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and are password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access by unauthorized third parties.  The investigator must permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. This verification may also occur after study completion. It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such as Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and Analytical Risk- Based Monitoring), methods, responsibilities and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring) are provided in the Monitoring Plan and contracts.  The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including quality checking of the data.  Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  Records and documents, including signed ICDs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator for 15 years after study completion unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. The investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securely for so long as they are maintained.  When participant data are to be deleted, the investigator will ensure that all copies of such data are promptly and irrevocably deleted from all systems.  The investigator(s) will notify sponsor or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with sponsor or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow sponsor or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the participant's medical records. The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection findings to sponsor or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide sponsor or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. 10.1.8. Source Documents  Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.  Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available.  Definition of what constitutes source data can be found in the Clinical Monitoring Plan.  Description of the use of computerized system is documented in the Study Monitoring Plan. 10.1.9. Study and Site Start and Closure The study start date is the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of participants. The first act of recruitment is the date of the first participant’s first visit and will be the study start date. The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time upon notification to CRO if requested to do so by the responsible IRB/IEC or if such termination is required to protect the health of Study Participants. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor may include but are not limited to:  Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines  Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator  Discontinuation of further study intervention development If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the ECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any CRO(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow-up. Study termination is also provided for in the clinical study agreement. If there is any conflict between the contract and this protocol the contract will control as to termination rights. 10.1.10. Publication Policy  The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings by the Investigator after publication of the overall study results or one year after end of the study (or study termination), whichever comes first.  The investigator agrees to refer to the primary publication in any subsequent publications such as secondary manuscripts and submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor 30 days before submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments and the Investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for any study- or Pfizer intervention-related information necessary to the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study results.  For all publications relating to the study, the Investigator will comply with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including those established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of the overall study results covering all Investigator sites. In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.  Authorship of publications for the overall study results will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  If publication is addressed in the clinical study agreement, the publication policy set out in this section will not apply. 10.1.11. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the supporting study documentation. To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical questions or problems, participants are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and study intervention identifiers, participant study numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the participant’s participation in the study. The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. For sites other than a Pfizer Clinical Research Unit (CRU), the contact number is not intended for use by the participant directly, and if a participant calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site. 10.2. Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory Tests  The following safety laboratory tests will be performed at times defined in the SoA (Section 1.3) section of this protocol. Additional laboratory results may be reported on these samples as a result of the method of analysis or the type of analyzer used by the clinical laboratory, or as derived from calculated values. These additional tests would not require additional collection of blood. Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety issues or as per local regulations.  The tests detailed in Table 2 will be performed by the central laboratory. (See laboratory manual.)  Local laboratory results are only required in the event that the central laboratory results are not available in time for either study intervention administration and/or response evaluation. If a local sample is required, it is important that the sample for central analysis is obtained at the same time. Additionally, if the local laboratory results are used to make either a study intervention decision or response evaluation, the results must be entered into the CRF.  Pregnancy Testing o Refer to Section 5.1 Inclusion Criteria and Section 8.2.13 Pregnancy Testing for screening pregnancy criteria. For details of timing of recommended pregnancy testing see the SoA (Section 1.3). Table 2. Protocol Required Safety Laboratory Assessments Table 2. Protocol Required Safety Laboratory Assessments NOTES:1.Participants with absolute lymphocyte counts <500/mm3 (0.5 × 109/L) will be reflex tested for FACS TBNK until the absolute lymphocyte count resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator and the sponsor. 2. In addition to re-testing creatinine kinase 3× ULN, urine myoglobin will be performed as reflex testing for any participant with a creatine kinase >10 × ULN. 3. In cases of suspected potential drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI), follow-up testing should be performed according to requirements in Section 10.5. 4. Only if urine dipstick is positive for blood, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, and/or protein. 5. Urine culture will be performed if urinalysis is positive for nitrite and/or leukocyte esterase or if clinically indicated. 6. For confirmation of postmenopausal status only in females who are not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). 7. Pregnancy tests (urine) for women of childbearing potential. In the event that urine pregnancy tests are not permitted at an institution, serum pregnancy tests must be utilized. Local urine testing will be standard for the protocol unless serum testing is required by local regulation or IRB/EC. 8. HIV testing per local regulations. Participants who are positive for HIV antibodies will be screen failed. 9. HBsAb will be performed as reflex testing for any participant who is HBsAg negative but HBcAb positive Please refer to Section 10.6 for testing algorithm, reflex testing, and full eligibility criteria. 10. Additional reflex testing for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid testing (HBVDNA) is also required for participants who are HBsAg negative and HBcAb positive in countries in which hepatitis B prevalence has been reported at a rate of >5.0% or if required by local standard of care. Please refer to Section 8.2.10.3 and Section 10.6 for testing algorithm, reflex testing, and full eligibility criteria. 11. HCVRNA will be performed as reflex testing for any participant who is HCVAb positive. 12. The QFT G test is preferred; however, the T Spot test is also permitted as described in Section 8.2.10.1. A PPD test can be substituted for the QFT G test or T Spot test only under specific circumstances described in Exclusion criterion 21 in Section 5.2 and Section 8.2.10.1. 13. A serum sample will be collected at Day 1 and submitted to the central lab. The sample will be stored and analyzed at a later date only at the sponsor’s request. In certain cases of suspected viral infection (eg, disseminated herpes zoster or varicella), the sponsor may request to analyze the sample to determine if the participant had exposure to that virus. 14. When required in cases of skin rash adverse events. See applicable sections for herpetiform rash (Section 8.2.9.2.1) and potential drug related rash (Section 8.2.9.2.2). 15. Lipid profile panel will include total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides. A minimum of 8-hour fasting is required for lipid profile evaluation. Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. Laboratory/analyte results that could unblind the study will not be reported to investigative sites or other blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.       10.4. Appendix 4: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy Information Definitions:Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP 1. Premenarchal 2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  Documented hysterectomy  Documented bilateral salpingectomy  Documented bilateral oophorectomy For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry. Note: Documentation for any of the above conditions can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the participant’s medical record for the study. 3. Postmenopausal female  A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.  A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT).  Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT at least 14 days prior to FSH testing to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. Contraception Guidance: No contraception methods are required for male participants in the study. Permitted Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods 1. Oral, injectable, or implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. 2. Intrauterine device (IUD). 3. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS). 4. Bilateral tubal occlusion or bilateral tubal ligation. 5. Oral, intravaginal, transdermal, or injectable combined (estrogen- and progestogen- containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation used in combination with a barrier method. Acceptable barrier methods include:  Male or female condom with or without spermicide;  Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide. Male condom and female condoms should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction). 6. Vasectomized partner. Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP, and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. The spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days. 7. Sexual abstinence. Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Additionally, contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical trials. 10.5. Appendix 5: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow-up Assessments Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These participants fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal (×ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2× ULN) by several days or weeks. The increase in TBili typically occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3× ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample). In rare instances, by the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Participants who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:  Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3× ULN AND a TBili value >2× ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2× ULN or not available;  For participants with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline: o Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3× ULN; or >8× ULN (whichever is smaller). o Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value by an amount of at least 1× ULN or if the value reaches >3× ULN (whichever is smaller). Rises in AST/ALT and TBili separated by more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT and TBili for suspected cases of Hy’s Law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology. A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either by itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over-the-counter medications), recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) and collection of serum sample for acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/ALT and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology. 10.6. Appendix 6: Hepatitis B Testing Alogrithm and Full Eligibility Criteria For participants in countries in which hepatitis B prevalence has been reported at a rate of >5.0%a or if required by local standard of care, participants will be tested as follows: At screening, HsBsAg and HBcAB will be tested: a.

Global prevalence, treatment, and prevention of 10.7. Appendix 7: Guidelines for Participant Safety Monitoring and Discontinuations These guidelines for participant safety monitoring and discontinuation are to be applied to all participants in Study B7981037. Additional individual participant monitoring is at the discretion of the investigator and dependent on any perceived safety concerns. Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess such concerns, and a participant may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator. For the purposes of safety monitoring and discontinuation, baseline values will be defined as follows:  Baseline values will be defined as the most recent pre-dose values before dosing on Day 1 for all participants. 10.7.1. Monitoring All potential treatment-related events of rash will be followed up until resolution or agreement with Pfizer. The following laboratory abnormalities require re-testing until resolution or agreement with Pfizer: Table 3. Laboratory Retesting Criteria a. Based on awareness of the abnormal result. b. Participants with absolute lymphocyte count <500/mm3 (0.5 × 109/L) will be reflex-tested for FACS-TBNK until the absolute lymphocyte count resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator and sponsor. c. In addition to re-testing creatinine kinase >3× ULN, urine myoglobin will be performed as reflex testing In case of positive urine pregnancy test, the participant will have study intervention interrupted and a serum sample collected on the same day (or as soon as possible) and submitted to the central laboratory for pregnancy testing. 10.7.2. Discontinuation Treatment will be discontinued, and the participant withdrawn from this study following completion of the Early Termination visit and the Follow-up Visit (whenever possible) for: Adverse Events:  Serious infections, defined as any infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy or hospitalization for treatment or meeting other criteria that require the infection to be classified as serious adverse event;  Treatment-related SAEs;  Clinically meaningful, treatment-emergent declines in hearing or clinically meaningful, treatment-emergent changes in audiological assessments from baseline (refer to Audiometry Study Guide for details) are to be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from study;  Other serious or severe AEs, at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor. ECG Findings:  Confirmed QTc >500 ms; F  Confirmed increase from baseline in QTc of >60 ms. F Study Intervention Interruptions:  Participants interrupting study intervention for more than 14 consecutive days are to be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study. Laboratory Abnormalities: All the following laboratory abnormalities require discontinuation if they are confirmed by re-test. Refer to the re-testing timeframes for laboratory abnormalities in Section 10.7.1:  Absolute Neutrophil Count <750/mm3 (<0.75 × 109/L).  Hemoglobin <9.0 g/dL (<5.59 mmol/L or <90 g/L) or a decrease of >30% from baseline (either criterion or both).  Platelet count <75,000/mm3 (<75.0 × 109/L).  Absolute Lymphocyte Count <500/mm (<0.5 × 10 /L). NOTE: Participants with absolute lymphocyte count <500/mm3 (0.5 × 109/L) will be reflex tested for FACS-TBNK until the absolute lymphocyte count resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator and sponsor.  Creatine kinase >10× ULN. NOTE: In addition to re-testing creatinine kinase >3× ULN, urine myoglobin will be performed as reflex testing for any participant with creatine kinase >10 × ULN.  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that meet ANY of the following:  >3× ULN with at least one total bilirubin value >2× ULN;  >3× ULN accompanied by signs or symptoms consistent with hepatic injury (eg, new onset elevated PT/INR);  Two sequential AST or ALT elevations >5× ULN, regardless of total bilirubin or accompanying signs or symptoms. NOTE: In each case, there is a need for additional investigations, such as review of ethanol, recreational drug, and dietary supplement consumption; testing for acute hepatitis A, B or C infection and biliary tract imaging should be promptly discussed with the sponsor or designee. Pregnancy: Female participants confirmed as pregnant during the study (see Section 8.3.5). Prohibited Medications:  Participants who are treated with any prohibited medication during the course of the study may require discontinuation. Participants who are administered a prohibited medication should be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study. Suicidal Ideation:  Participants with a “yes” answer on items 4, 5, or on any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C-SSRS must be discontinued. The participant must be referred to a mental health professional for appropriate evaluation and treatment. If the participant cannot be seen by a mental health professional within 24 hours, then the participant should be sent to a local emergency room for psychiatric assessment. Discontinuation/End of Treatment Monitoring:  Any participant meeting discontinuation criteria must enter into the Follow-up Period with their first follow-up visit occurring 1 week after their last dose whenever possible, until the event has returned to normal or baseline levels or is deemed clinically stable. The procedures scheduled for Early Termination Visit will be performed on the last day the participant takes the study intervention or as soon as possible thereafter. The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. Additional follow-up visits may occur as needed until any clinically relevant abnormalities or adverse events have resolved, returned to a baseline state, or are deemed clinically stable.  Any participant that is discontinued from study intervention due to an auditory adverse event must have BAEP and auditory assessments performed at the time of discontinuation and repeated at 6 months after the last dose of study intervention. Refer to the Manual for BAEP Evaluations and the Audiology Study Guide for additional information.  Any participant that is discontinued from study intervention due to a neurological adverse event must have skin biopsy and neurological evaluations, including the Neuropathy Assessment, performed at the time of discontinuation, and repeated at 6 months after the last dose of study intervention. Refer to the Manuals for General Neurological and Neuropathy Assessments for additional information. 10.8. Appendix 8: Prohibited and Permitted Concomitant CYP3A Inducers and Substrates Please note that this list addresses only CYP3A inducers and sensitive and moderate sensitive CYP3A substrates. Other prohibited medications for this trial are listed in Section 5.2. Refer to Section 6.5.1 for additional information regarding permitted medications for this trial, including CYP3A inhibitors. This is not an all-inclusive list. Study personnel should stay current and consult with their pharmacy to exclude all concomitant medications that are moderate to potent CYP3A inducers. If a medication is a sensitive or moderate sensitive CYP3A substrate and is not listed here, consultation with the Sponsor is required. 10.8.1. Prohibited Concomitant CYP3A Inducers and Substrates a. Sensitive CYP3A substrates are drugs that demonstrate an increase in concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5-fold with strong index inhibitors of a given metabolic pathway in clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies.b.Moderate sensitive substrates are drugs that demonstrate an increase in AUC of 2 to <5-fold. In a situation where appropriate medical care of a participant requires the use of a prohibited CYP3A inducer: Moderate to potent inducers of CYP3A are not permitted in the study EXCEPT in emergency situations. Note: Mitotane is not permitted for any duration due to its long half-life; however, if necessary mitotane may be used in an emergency, however the participant will then be discontinued from the study. Topical (including skin or mucous membranes) application of antimicrobial and antifungal medications is permitted. c. All prohibited drugs that are CYP3A inducers require at least a 28 day or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) washout prior to the first dose of study intervention. d. Notated as potent inducers. 10.8.2. Permitted Concomitant CYP3A Substrates Lurasidonea.Sensitive CYP3A substrates are drugs that demonstrate an increase in concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5-fold with strong index inhibitors of a given metabolic pathway in clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies.b.Moderate sensitive substrates are drugs that demonstrate an increase in AUC of ≥2 to <5-fold. 10.9. Appendix 9: Alternative Measures During Public Emergencies The alternative study measures described in this section are to be followed during public emergencies, including the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This appendix applies for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic globally and will become effective for other public emergencies only upon written notification from Pfizer. NOTE: Any deviations from the SoA (Section 1.3) or the protocol (eg, missed or partially completed procedures or assessments) must be reported to the Sponsor in a timely manner and will be reported by the Sponsor as a protocol deviation. Procedures which are missed due to disruptions related to a public emergency, including the COVID-19 pandemic, are required to be performed at the next available opportunity, even if outside of a protocol-specified visit window. Use of these alternative study measures are expected to cease upon the return of business as usual circumstances (including the lifting of any quarantines and travel bans/advisories). In this appendix, safety assessment terms include 1) special safety assessments (audiological evaluations, including BAEP, by the audiologist, neurological evaluation by the neurologist, and the skin biopsy) and 2) usual safety assessments (all other safety evaluations). 10.9.1. Eligibility While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing is not mandated for this study, local clinical practice standards for testing should be followed. A participant should be excluded if he/she has a positive test result for SARS-CoV2 infection, is known to have asymptomatic infection, or is suspected of having SARS-CoV2. Participants with active infections are excluded from study participation per Exclusion Criterion 19. When the infection resolves, the potential participant may be considered for re- screening. In addition, the following criteria apply:  The participant must be able to perform all Screening and Day 1 procedures per the SoA (Section 1.3) at the study site (CXR, skin biopsy, SALT) and/or designated ancillary facility (eg, audiological evaluations and neurological evaluations) to determine whether the participant meets eligibility criteria for the study. This includes collection and resulting of laboratory assessments through the central laboratory vendor.  The participant must meet eligibility criteria for the study and have had the initial Day 1 skin biopsy performed.  At the time of Randomization it must be confirmed that the participant will be able to have the Month 1 and Month 3 safety laboratory tests collected/performed at the study site or an alternative clinical laboratory facility (including the participant’s home, as available) according to the windows in Section 10.9.3. If a participant does not meet the criteria described above, they cannot be enrolled in the 10.9.2. Telehealth Visits In the event that in-clinic study visits cannot be conducted, every effort should be made to follow up on the safety of study participants at scheduled visits per the SoA (Section 1.3) or unplanned visits. Telehealth visits may be used to continue to assess participant safety and collect data points. Telehealth includes the exchange of healthcare information and services via telecommunication technologies (eg, audio, video, video-conferencing software) remotely, allowing the participant and the investigator to communicate on aspects of clinical care, including medical advice, reminders, education, and safety monitoring. The following assessments must be performed during a telehealth visit:  Review dosing logs and record investigational product, including doses taken and any interruptions in intake of investigational product (ie, missed doses) since the last contact, and calculate compliance.  Review and record any AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to Section 8.3.  Review and record any new concomitant medications or changes in concomitant medications since the last contact.  For WOCBP: Review and record contraceptive method and results of pregnancy testing. Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. Refer to Appendix 4 and Section 10.9.3.1 of this appendix regarding pregnancy tests.  Body temperature and collection method (eg, oral, tympanic, axillary), pulse rate, and respiratory rate (measured by study participant/caregiver).  Collection of interim audiological history (using Part 1 in the Audiometry Guide Worksheet for Post Day 1 visits) at visits requiring audiological evaluation with entry of clinically significant changes onto the AE section of the eCRF, as appropriate.  Collection of interim neurological history (using General Neurology and Neuropathy Assessment Completion Guidelines) must be obtained, with entry of clinically significant changes onto the AE section of the eCRF, as appropriate.  Administration of the C-SSRS performed by a qualified rater. As per Section 8.2.11.1, if there are “yes” answers on items 4 or 5 of the suicidal ideation section or on any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C-SSRS, the participant will be discontinued from the study and referred to a mental health professional for appropriate evaluation and treatment. NOTE: If the investigator determines that additional evaluation is warranted based on the information collected during the remote visit described above, follow-up is required to be performed, with results submitted to and reviewed by the investigator prior to shipping investigational product to the participant. Study participants must be reminded to promptly notify site staff about any change in their health status. 10.9.3. Alternative Facilities for Safety Assessments 10.9.3.1. Laboratory Testing (Usual Safety Assessments) With the exceptions noted in Section 10.9.1 for Screening and Day 1, if a study participant is unable to visit the site for protocol-specified safety laboratory evaluations, testing may be conducted at a local laboratory if permitted by local regulations. The local laboratory may be a standalone institution or within a hospital. Collection of blood and urine samples may also be performed at the participant’s home per Section 10.9.5. The following safety laboratory evaluations may be performed at a local laboratory:  Hematology;  Serum chemistry;  Lipid panel;  Urinalysis;  Pregnancy testing (for WOCBP);  Refer to the SoA (Section 1.3) for visits at which these tests are required and to Section 10.2 for additional details regarding these tests. If it is not possible for the participant to have the above tests completed within the visit window specified in the SoA (Section 1.3), an extended window may be allowed to collect samples for these laboratory tests, provided that the investigator has performed the remote visit as described above, assessed each case, and determined that it would not increase risk to a participant. The extended windows for laboratory sample collection for each study visit are noted in Table 4. These windows apply only to laboratory samples collected during interruptions due to public emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic, based upon written notification from Pfizer. If the laboratory samples are not collected within the specified extended window for the visit, the participant must temporarily withhold investigational product until the required laboratory samples can be collected. If a local laboratory is used, qualified study site personnel must order, receive, and review results. Site staff must collect the local laboratory reference ranges and certifications/ accreditations for filing at the site. Laboratory test results are to be provided to the site staff as soon as possible and must be received and reviewed by the investigator within 14 days after they are collected in order to determine eligibility to continue dosing. In addition, laboratory test results from the previous visit must be available and reviewed by the investigator prior to shipping investigational product at the current visit. The local laboratory reports should be filed in the participant’s source documents/medical records. Relevant data from the local laboratory report should be recorded on the CRF. Special attention should be paid to ensure that laboratory results are checked against the Guidelines for Participant Safety Monitoring and Discontinuations in Section 10.7 and that required follow-up is performed as applicable. If a participant requiring pregnancy testing cannot visit a local laboratory for pregnancy testing, a home urine pregnancy testing kit with a sensitivity of at least 25 IU/mL may be used by the participant to perform the test at home, if compliant with local regulatory by the participant (or their legally authorized representative, if appropriate) during the remote visit. The urine pregnancy test result must be available prior to dispensing or shipping investigational product to a participant. The pregnancy test outcome should be documented in the participant’s source documents/medical records and relevant data recorded on the CRF. It should be confirmed that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. Table 4. Windows for Remote Visits, Laboratory Sample Collections, and Special Safety Assessments if Required due to Public Emergencies Including COVID-19 a. These are the same as the windows in the protocol SoA (Section 1.3). b. Laboratory results must be received and reviewed by the investigator within 14 days after they are collected to determine eligibility to continue dosing. In addition, laboratory test results from the previous visit must be available and reviewed by the investigator prior to shipping investigational product at the current visit. c. The visit window for the on-site visit (Special Safety Assessments) for Month 9 is -7/+60 days and (Section 10.9.4). 10.9.3.2. Electrocardiograms If the participant is unable to visit the study site for an ECG after the Screening visit, the participant may visit an alternative facility, or alternatively in the participant’s home, if available, to have the ECG performed according to the guidelines in Section 8.2.4. Qualified study site personnel must order, receive, and review results. 10.9.3.3. Audiological and Neurological Specialist Evaluations At visits after Screening which require audiological or neurological evaluation, if the participant is unable to visit the designated ancillary center for audiological or neurological evaluation, the audiological history (Part 1 in the Audiometry Guide Worksheet for Post Day 1 visits) and neurological history (General Neurology and Neuropathy Assessment Completion Guidelines) must be collected at the study site; during the remote visit per Section 10.9.2; or during the home health visit per Section 10.9.6. Clinically significant changes should be recorded as AEs in CRF. The audiological evaluations, including the BAEP, and the neurological evaluations must be performed per Section 8.2.6 at the next available opportunity, even if outside of the protocol-specified visit window. 10.9.3.4. Skin Biopsies At visits after Day 1 which require a skin biopsy, if the participant is unable to visit the study site, then the skin biopsy must be performed at the next available opportunity, even if outside of a protocol-specified visit window. 10.9.4. Month 9 Visit Window The visit window for the special safety assessments at Month 9 in the setting of a public health emergency is expanded to -7 / +60 days. The usual safety assessments are to be completed as above. The full month 9 visit including the special safety assessments (audiological evaluations, neurological evaluation, and the skin biopsy) have until +60 days to be completed onsite or at the designated ancillary center. If required Special Safety Assessments (Section 10.9) cannot be performed at Month 9, the participant will not be allowed into the active therapy extension phase and must follow Early Termination procedures (Section 7.1). Double-blind investigational product is dispensed until all the specialized safety assessments have been completed. The site staff should contact the IMPALA Help Desk for assistance. Active therapy investigational product is dispensed only after all the special safety assessments have been completed and is the start of the extension portion of the study. 10.9.5. Study Intervention If the safety of a trial participant is at risk because they cannot complete required evaluations or adhere to critical mitigation steps, then discontinuing that participant from study intervention must be considered. Study intervention may be shipped by courier to study participants if permitted by local regulations and in accordance with storage and transportation requirements for the study intervention. Pfizer does not permit the shipment of study intervention by mail. The tracking record of shipments and the chain of custody of study intervention must be kept in the participant’s source documents/medical records. If a third-party courier engaged by Pfizer or Pfizer’s contract research organization (CRO) is used for shipping the study intervention, written consent must be documented in the informed consent document prior to shipping study intervention. If a third-party courier engaged by Pfizer or Pfizer’s CRO is not used for shipping the study intervention, consent must be verbally obtained (or per local guidelines/regulations) and documented in site’s Prior to shipping study intervention to a participant, 1) consent must be obtained and documented as described above, 2) all required safety information listed in Section 10.9.2. must have been collected and reviewed by the investigator, 3) the required laboratory tests from the previous visit must have been reviewed by the investigator, and 4) any additional evaluation (if requested based on investigator judgment) must have been performed, with results submitted to and reviewed by the investigator. Study intervention cannot be shipped to the participant and must be temporarily discontinued if 1) the laboratory tests from the previous visit have not been reviewed by the investigator OR 2) after reviewing the required information (including that from a remote visit), the investigator cannot make an assessment of whether it is safe for the participant to continue study intervention. Refer to Section 6.4 regarding temporary withholding of study intervention. The study site may deliver the study intervention to participants using an acceptable delivery method only if this is consistent with local laws and regulations and the site is able to ship the study intervention according to the guidelines provided by the Sponsor in a separate document. The amount of study intervention to be shipped should correspond to the amount dispensed per the Impala Quick Reference Guide at the specific study visit which is being conducted remotely. Dispensing and/or shipment of additional study intervention to extend the visit window is not permitted. Participants should continue taking the current supply of study intervention until the new supply is received (unless temporary withholding of study intervention is required). Dosing logs should be shipped with the study intervention. Study sites should follow up with the participant once the study intervention is received by the participant to review when to start using the new blister cards, the dosing instructions, and completion of the dosing logs. Participants should be instructed not to re-use or dispose of any blister cards dispensed at a previous visit. All blister cards and dosing logs must be returned to the study site at the next on-site visit. 10.9.6. Home Health Visits If available, a home health care service may be utilized to facilitate scheduled visits per the SoA (Section 1.3) if operationally feasible and will be conducted according to local regulations. Home health visits include a healthcare provider conducting an in-person study visit at the participant’s location, rather than an in-person study visit at the site. If a third-party engaged by Pfizer or Pfizer’s CRO is used for home health visits, written consent must be documented in the ICD prior to conducting the first home health visit. If a third-party engaged by Pfizer or Pfizer’s CRO is not used for home health visits, consent must be verbally obtained and documented in site’s source documents (or per local guidelines/regulations) prior to conducting the first home health visit. The C-SSRS, SALT, and PGI-C cannot be assessed at a home visit. The following may be performed during a home health visit:  Review dosing logs and record study intervention, including doses taken and any interruptions in intake of study intervention (ie, missed doses) since the last contact, and calculate compliance.  Review and record any AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to Section 8.3.  Review and record any new concomitant medications or changes in concomitant medications since the last contact.  For WOCBP: Review and record contraceptive method and results of pregnancy testing. Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol (Section 10.4). Refer to Section 8.2.13 of the protocol and Section 10.9.3.1 regarding pregnancy tests.  Collection of updated audiological history (Part 1 in the Audiometry Guide Worksheet for Post Day 1 visits) at visits requiring audiological evaluation. with entry of clinically significant changes onto the AE section of the eCRF, as appropriate.  Collection of interim neurological history (using General Neurology and Neuropathy Assessment Completion Guidelines) must be obtained, with entry of clinically significant changes onto the AE section of the eCRF, as appropriate.  Body temperature and collection method (eg, oral, tympanic, axillary), pulse rate, and respiratory rate (measured by study participant/caregiver).  ECG per Section 8.2.4.  Hematology.  Serum chemistry.  Lipid panel.  Urinalysis.  Pregnancy testing (for WOCBP).  Physical examination. 10.9.7. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events If a participant has a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection during the study, this should be reported as an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE) and appropriate medical intervention provided. For non-serious COVID-19 infections, temporary participant has recovered from the COVID-19 infection. If this is a serious infection (ie, requires parenteral antimicrobial therapy or hospitalization for treatment or meeting other criteria that require the infection to be classified as a serious adverse event), the participant must be permanently discontinued from investigational product per Section 10.7.2 of the protocol. 10.9.8. Efficacy Assessments The SALT and PGI-C (Section 8.1.2 and Section 8.1.3) are only to be collected during on- site visits. 10.10.
