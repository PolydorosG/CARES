Document History Amendment 5 26 June 2020  In the Schedule of Activities, Protocol Summary, Section 1.2.4 Study Rationale, Section 2 Study Objectives and Endpoints, Section 3 Study Design, Section 7.4 Clinical Efficacy Assessment, Section 7.7 Photography, and Section 9 Data Analysis/Statistical Methods, added central read Facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (facial-VASI) as the new primary endpoint. Added new key secondary endpoint: Proportion of subjects achieving central read facial-VASI75 (defined as at least 75% improvement in central read facial-VASI from baseline) at Week 24. Rationale: As this is an unprecedented indication, there has been limited clinical trial experience with the VASI and facial-VASI scoring for de-pigmented vitiliginous lesions. Discrepancies have been identified by an external blinded expert consultant in preparation for the protocol specified interim analysis. Based on the digital photographs available, total body VASI scores cannot be evaluated by a central reader. Due to this limitation and in order to preserve the scientific integrity of the study, the primary endpoint is changed from the percent change from baseline in total body VASI at Week 24 to percent change from baseline in central read facial-VASI at Week 24. Central read facial-VASI75 score will be added as a key secondary endpoint.  In the Section 2 Study Objectives and Endpoints, added new exploratory endpoint: proportion of subjects achieving “very much improved” on patient global impression of change in vitiligo (PGIC-V). Rationale: This change is to correct the editorial error and to be consistent with the scaling of PGIC on evaluation of improvement assessed as “very much improved” and “much improved”.  In the Section 7.4.3 Facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index Site Assessment, clarification added that the site assessment facial-VASI will be performed by the investigator(s). Rationale: To differentiate site assessment and central assessment facial-VASI.  In Section 9.1 Sample Size Determination, the sample size rationale was updated to reflect the assumptions for the new primary endpoint, central read facial-VASI. Rationale: The sample size rationale is updated to be aligned with the new primary endpoint.  In Section 9.2 Efficacy Analysis, the analysis of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints were updated. Rationale: The analysis is updated to be aligned with the new primary and key secondary endpoint.  In Section 9.5 Safety Analysis during the Dose Ranging Period, the detail of the analysis is removed. Rationale: The detail of the analysis will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.  In the Appendix 11, added Alternative Measures During Public Emergencies. Rationale: The Alternative Measures During Public Emergencies added to address alternative protocol actions to follow during COVID-9 pandemic. Minor administrative changes and sentence revisions made throughout the document. Amendment 4 04 November  In the Cover page, added IND number for 2019 PF-06700841.  Committees, additional tests or procedures that are not part of the study but that could be related to the study may be requested. Rationale: The paragraph is added to provide clarity to support safety adjudication process.  In Appendix 2, clarification was provided for Prohibited Concomitant Medications related to applicability to PF-06651600 and PF-06700841. Minor administrative changes and sentence revisions made throughout the document. Amendment 2 14 June 2019 Changes requested from The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, BfArM) for Germany.  In the Schedule of Activities and Section 6.1 Screening, added statement that subjects will be provided with an emergency ID card.  In the Schedule of Activities and Section 7 Assessments, added erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) testing to be performed at local laboratory at every visit. These changes are in effect for Germany only.  In the Section 1.2.4.1 PF-06651600 Dose Rationale, added rationale for administering 10 mg PF-06651600 QD in the Dose Ranging Period not in the Extension Period.  In the Section 4.2 Exclusion Criteria, added exclusion criterion for subjects who have galactosemia (galactose-1-phosphate- uridylyltransferase or UDP-galactose-4- epimerase or galactokinase deficiency; Fanconi Bickel syndrome), a congenital lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.  In the Section 4.2 Exclusion Criteria, added exclusion criterion for subjects whose diabetes mellitus is poorly controlled.  In the Section 8 Adverse Event Reporting, added definitions of adverse reaction (AR), serious adverse reaction (SAR), and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR).  In the Appendix 2 Prohibited Concomitant medications, added Rosuvastatin as a sensitive substrate to BCRP. This change is in effect for Germany only.  Minor administrative changes and sentence revisions made throughout the document. Amendment 1 04 March 2019  In the Schedule of Activities, Section 2 Study Objectives and Endpoints, and Section 7 Assessments, added target lesions(s) assessments. Rationale: Target lesion(s) assessments are added to provide opportunity to evaluate the change of extent of depigmentation of stable lesion and segmental lesion (if applicable) during the study to support the extrapolability of results across vitiligo types.  In the Schedule of Activities and Section 7 Assessments, details of Dermoscopy assessment are revised. Rationale: Details of Dermoscopy assessment are revised to provide a clearer guidance for the site.  In the Section 2 Study Objectives and Endpoints, from baseline in facialVASI and VES in the Dose Ranging Period and absolute change from baseline in facialVASI, VES in the Extension Period. Rationale: The exploratory endpoints outlined above are added to provide opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of PF-06651600 compared to placebo by facial-VASI and VES during the Dose Ranging Period and to evaluate the long term efficacy of PF-06651600 and efficacy of PF-06700841 by absolute change from baseline in facial-VASI, VES.  In the Schedule of Activities, visit window is revised for Table 3, 4, and 5. Rationale: Visit Window is revised to allow greater flexibility for participant scheduling.  In the Section 1.2.3.1 Nonclinical Safety, added new non-clinical safety information. Rationale: emerging data from Rat Fertility study was added.  In the Section 1.2.3.2 Clinical Experience, emerging data was added demonstrating a drug interaction (DDI) with oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol (EE). Section 4.4.1 Contraception Requirements were modified to include an additional barrier method of contraception when combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with inhibition of ovulation is used. Rationale: Contraception requirements revised based on the new oral contraceptive DDI study to ensure patient safety.  Section 1.2.4 Study Rationale, Section 4 Subject Eligibility Criteria, and Section 4.4.1 Contraception Requirements, No contraception methods are required for male subjects under  correct minor grammatical or spelling errors. This amendment incorporates all revisions to date, including amendments made at the request of country health authorities and institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs).

Alternative Measures During Public Emergencies .........................................174 PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background and Rationale The janus kinase (JAK) family, including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (TYK2), is a group of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via interactions with Type 1 and Type 2 cytokine receptors which are critical for leukocyte activation, proliferation, survival and function.35,36 Upon binding of the cytokine to its receptor, the associated JAKs are activated, and phosphorylate each other and the receptor. The phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for the signal transducer and activator of the transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. The STATs are phosphorylated and subsequently translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific gene promoters to activate transcription of a range of target genes.35,36 PF-06651600 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits, by irreversibly blocking the ATP binding site, JAK3 and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase family (bruton’s tyrosine kinase [BTK], bone marrow-expressed kinase [BMX], inducible T-cell kinase [ITK], TEC, resting lymphocyte kinase [RLK/TXK]), with high selectivity over the other three JAK isoforms, JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, as well as over the broader kinome. PF-06651600 is currently being investigated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease and will be investigated in vitiligo. Considering the pathogenesis of vitiligo and mechanisms of action for PF-06651600, the hypothesis is to determine if PF-06651600 will have a clinically meaningful effect on treating active non-segmental vitiligo. PF-06700841 is a dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor with a good selectivity profile over the other human kinases including JAK2. TYK2/JAK1 play critical roles in interferon gamma (IFN) signaling that regulate the signal transduction pathways triggered by several cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo.21 Study Objectives and Endpoints Study Objectives and Endpoints during Dose Ranging Period Secondary Objectives: Secondary Endpoints:  To evaluate the efficacy of PF-06651600  Absolute change from baseline in central read and site compared to placebo by other efficacy assessment of the facial-VASI and VES at designated markers in adult subjects with active time points. non-segmental vitiligo.  Change from baseline in dermatology life quality index (DLQI)/EuroQol 5 dimension 5 level (EQ-5D-5L)/healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) at designated time points as specified in the SoA.  Facial target lesion improvement (by planimetry) of ≥50% from baseline at Week 24 (if data allow).  Proportion of subjects achieving “very much improved” or “much improved” on patient global impression of change in vitiligo (PGIC-V).  Proportion of subjects achieving a score of 4 (a lot less noticeable) or 5 (no longer noticeable) on Vitiligo                              1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Mechanism of Action/Indication PF-06651600 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits, by irreversibly blocking the ATP binding site, JAK3 and the TEC kinase family (BTK, BMX, ITK, TEC, RLK/TXK), with high selectivity over the other three JAK isoforms, JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, as well as over the broader kinome. PF-06651600 is currently being investigated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease and will be investigated in vitiligo. PF-06700841 is a dual inhibitor of human tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (TYK2) and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) that is currently being investigated in patients with psoriasis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease and will be investigated in vitiligo. 1.2. Background and Rationale The JAK family, including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, is a group of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via interactions with Type 1 and Type 2 cytokine receptors which are critical for leukocyte activation, proliferation, survival and function.35,36 Upon binding of the cytokine to its receptor, the associated JAKs are activated, and phosphorylate each other and the receptor. The phosphorylated receptors serve as docking sites for the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. The STATs are phosphorylated and subsequently translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific gene promoters to activate transcription of a range of target genes.35,36 PF-06651600 potently inhibits signaling of the common- chain receptors for IL-2, IL-15, and IL-17, which have been implicated in the pathogenic pathways of vitiligo.2,13 Considering the pathogenesis of vitiligo and mechanisms of action for PF-06651600, the hypothesis is to determine if PF-06651600 will have a clinically meaningful effect on treating active non-segmental vitiligo. PF-06700841 is a dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor with a good selectivity profile over the other human kinases including JAK2. TYK2/JAK1 play critical roles in IFN signaling that regulate the signal transduction pathways triggered by several cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo.21 1.2.1. Study Background Vitiligo is an acquired hypopigmented disorder with or without autoimmune comorbidities including thyroid disease, alopecia areata, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus and pernicious anemia.29 The worldwide prevalence of vitiligo ranges between 0.5% and 2.0%.19 Lesions are depigmented completely at the initiation phase and pigmented orifices of hair follicles are seen at the recovering phase. Differential diagnoses include Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, halo nevus/nevi, malignancy-induced hypopigmentation (melanoma and mycosis fungoides), postinflammatory hypopigmentation, pityriasis alba (a minor manifestation of atopic dermatitis), senile leukoderma (age-related sdcelpeirgomsies,n atantdio mn)e, lcahsmema.i3c3alV/dirtuilgig-ion dcuance bde l eculaksosdifeiermd ain, taot atxwioa tfeolramngs ibeacstaesdi ao,n t udbisetrroibuus tion patterns: non-segmental vitiligo (wide distribution; also known as generalized vitiligo) and segmental vitiligo (confined to the dermatome).6,33 Vitiligo also can be classified into two forms based on disease activities: active vitiligo (confetti-like lesions, trichrome lesions and Koebner phenomenon) and stable vitiligo (more than 30% of white hair as determined by dermoscopy).1,16 Since vitiligo has been given a diagnosis code (L80) by the World Health Organization, may result from autoimmunity, has numerous systemic associations, and adversely affects quality of life with significant economic burden, it is considered a serious medical disease.7 The trifecta of vitiligo pathogenesis can be oxidative stress causing melanocyte damage, genetics affecting melanocyte growth and differentiation, and autoimmunity involving autoreactive cytotoxic T cells,26 although, the complex pathophysiology of vitiligo is not fully understood. Stressed melanocytes may initiate the activated innate immunity via natural killer cells and nearby dendritic cells, followed by the activation of adaptive immunity.26 The presence of CD8+ T cells in close apposition to melanocytes suggests that the pathogenesis of vitiligo is T cell mediated although antibody-mediated pathogenesis is also proposed.33 Recent review proposes the hypothesis that CD8+ T cells produce IFN , which activate the release of CXCL9/10/11 from keratinocytes, which in turn activate the function of CD8+ T cells via the activation of CXCR3.26 Cytokines involved in vitiligo include IFN, IL-2, IL-17, IL-15 and IL-4. Of note, IL-2 and IL-15 are suggested to activate CD49a+/CD8+ resident memory T cells in vitiligo skin and to induce perforin and granzyme B in those T cells, which induce melanocyte apoptosis.2 There are currently no approved treatments specifically to treat active non-segmental vitiligo. Current treatment options, which are limited and may be inefficacious, include topical corticosteroids, topical vitamin D3, topical calcineurin inhibitors, systemic corticosteroids (to treat rapidly progressive active lesions), phototherapy, surgical treatments (to treat small and stable lesions) and camouflage.6,26,29 Recent case reports have suggested potential utility of JAK inhibitors in treating vitiligo. Tofacitinib a JAK inhibitor, appears to have a repigmentation effect on vitiligo, noting that concomitant phototherapy may be necessary.3,8,18,20 Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, also seems to have a similar effect.10,17,28 Considering the pathogenesis of vitiligo and mechanisms of action for PF-06651600 and PF-06700841, the hypothesis is to determine if PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 will have a clinically meaningful effect on treating active non-segmental vitiligo. 1.2.2. Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism 1.2.2.1. Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of PF-06651600 Following intravenous and oral administration of PF-06651600 to rats and dogs, absorption was rapid with high bioavailability in both species (approximately 85-100%). The high oral bioavailability indicated high absorption from the gut, consistent with its high in-vitro passive permeability properties. Plasma clearance (CL) was approximately 69 and 13 mL/min/kg in rat and dog respectively. Half-life was approximately 0.33 and 1.1 hour in concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) in repeat oral pivotal toxicology studies increased with increasing dose in rats (up to 400 mg/kg/day) and dogs (up to 45 mg/kg/day). Renal excretion of parent PF-06651600 was limited in the rat and dog. Biliary excretion of parent PF-06651600 was limited in the rat. PF-06651600 binding to plasma proteins was approximately 10 to 30% across species (fraction unbound values for rat, dog, and human were 0.67, 0.82 and 0.86 respectively). In vitro and in vivo metabolite profiling suggested that the primary clearance mechanisms for PF-06651600 were cytochrome P450 mediated oxidation and glutathione related conjugation. No unique human metabolites were observed in vitro compared to metabolite profiles in rat and dog. Reaction phenotyping in recombinant enzyme systems identified CYP3A4 as the predominant CYP450 isoform responsible for the metabolism of PF-06651600, with minor contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP3A5. In addition, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) conjugate was formed in a time dependent manner in recombinant GST mu 1-1 and pi 1-1 incubations. PF-06651600 showed a low risk of inhibition and induction of the major CYP450 enzymes as well as the major uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes. However, in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, PF-06651600 showed evidence of time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. This CYP3A4 inhibition indicated a potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions for which CYP3A constitutes the primary mechanism of clearance. Further details of the non-clinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of PF-06651600 are provided in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 1.2.2.2. Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of PF-06700841 The pharmacokinetic (PK) of PF-06700841 have been studied in rat where the compound has shown a plasma clearance of 31 mL/min/kg, a volume of distribution of 2.0 L/kg, and oral bioavailability of approximately 80-100%. The high oral bioavailability indicated high absorption from the gut, consistent with its high in-vitro passive permeability properties. Rat in vivo clearance was predicted within approximately 2-fold by both in vitro rat liver microsomes and hepatocyte intrinsic clearance highlighting the importance of CYP450 metabolism. Systemic exposures of PF-06700841 as measured by C and AUC in repeat max 24 oral pivotal toxicology studies increased with increasing dose in rats (up to 55 mg/kg/day) and monkeys (up to 45 mg/kg/day). Renal and biliary elimination of parent PF-06700841 was limited in rat. Plasma protein binding of PF-06700841 was consistent across rat, monkey, and human with a fraction unbound (fu) of approximately 0.6-0.7. Values of fu were lower in mouse (fu = 0.51) and rabbit (fu = 0.36). Oxidative metabolites of PF-06700841 accounted for the primary routes of biotransformation in rat, monkey, and human consistent with CYP450 as the primary clearance route. No unique human metabolites of PF-06700841 were evident compared to the safety species of   Safety Results SAD Period: during the SAD period, 31 subjects had a total of 42 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE)s, 30 of which were considered to be treatment-related. There were no deaths, severe adverse events (AE)s, temporary discontinuations, or dose reductions due to AEs reported in this period. Two (2) subjects reported treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) during the SAD period (1 subject each in the PF-06651600 200 mg [furuncle]) and PF-06651600 400 mg [pilonidal cyst] treatment groups). Four (4) subjects discontinued from the study during the SAD period (1 subject each in the placebo [erythema] and the PF-06651600 100 mg [rash macro papular], PF-06651600 200 mg [furuncle], and PF-06651600 400 mg [pilonidal cyst] treatment groups) due to AEs. The system organ classes (SOCs) with the greatest number of subjects reporting AEs in the SAD period were infections and infestations (8 subjects); nervous system disorders (7 subjects); gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (5 subjects); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (5 subjects); and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (5 subjects). Most TEAEs reported in the SOCs of GI disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and nervous system disorders (5 subjects in each SOC) were treatment-related. There were generally few TEAEs in the SAD period, most of which occurred in a single subject, with the exception of headache and nasopharyngitis (experienced by 5 subjects each) and oropharyngeal pain (experienced by 4 subjects). Most of the TEAEs were mild in severity except for the following AEs that were moderate in severity: 1 AE each in the PF-06651600 5 mg (oropharyngeal pain), 20 mg (musculoskeletal pain), and 200 mg (subcutaneous abscess) treatment groups; 2 AEs in the placebo group (dry skin and limb injury); 3 AEs in the PF-06651600 400 mg treatment group (nasopharyngitis, pilonidal cyst, and headache), and 5 AEs in the PF-06651600 100 mg treatment group (abdominal pain, arthralgia, rash maculopapular, and 2 AEs of headache). MAD Period: during the MAD period, 35 subjects had a total of 90 TEAEs, 75 of which were considered to be treatment-related. The treatment groups with the most AEs were the PF-06651600 400 mg QD (39 AEs in 13 subjects), 200 mg BID (16 AEs in 5 subjects), and 100 mg BID treatment groups (14 AEs in 4 subjects). There were no deaths, temporary discontinuations, or dose reductions due to AEs reported in this period. One (1) subject who received PF-06651600 400 mg QD during the MAD period reported an SAE (varicella). Two (2) subjects experienced severe AEs during the MAD period (1 subject each in the PF-06651600 400 mg QD [varicella] and PF-06651600 200 mg BID [rash macro papular] treatment groups. Two (2) subjects discontinued from the study during the MAD period (1 subject each in the PF-06651600 400 mg QD [herpes zoster] and PF-06651600 200 mg BID [rash macro-papular] treatment groups) due to AEs. The SOCs with the greatest number of subjects reporting AEs in the MAD period were skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (21 subjects); GI disorders (18 subjects); nervous system disorders (12 subjects); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (6 subjects); and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (5 subjects). Most TEAEs reported in the    comparison of individual and dose normalized geometric mean Cmax and AUCtau values. The geometric mean value for the accumulation ratio (R ) ranged from 1.0 to 1.8 for the QD ac dosing and was 1.7 for the 100 mg BID dosing. This ratio compares AUC for multiple tau dose administration to AUC for single dose administration, and assesses the magnitude of tau accumulation with multiple dose administration. Similar R ratios were observed for C ac max (R C ), which ranged from 0.9 to 1.4 for QD dosing and was 1.0 for 100 mg BID dosing. ac max The steady state accumulation ratio (R ) compares AUC for multiple dose administration ss tau to AUC for single dose administration, and assesses the linearity in PK exposure from a inf single dose to steady state. Geometric mean R values were consistently ≥1, ranging from ss 1.0 to 1.8, suggesting that there may be a greater than dose proportional increase in PF-06651600 exposure with multiple dose administration. However, based on R and ac R C , the increase in exposure after 14 days of multiple dosing is less than 2-fold for any ac max of the dosing regimens studied. Steady state generally appears to have been reached by Day 4 for the QD regimens and Day 6 for the BID regimens based on similar median trough (predose) concentrations on Days 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14. Urinary recovery of PF-06651600 was low, with approximately <8% of the dose recovered unchanged in urine on Day 14 across all doses (geometric mean amount of drug excreted from time zero to time tau, the dosing interval [Ae ]% of 4.1% to 7.0%). Renal clearance tau ranged from 42.9 mL/min to 63.1 mL/min. The relative bioavailability (B7981003) of 50 mg PF-06651600 tablets was compared to 50 mg oral suspension. The ratio (90% confidence interval [CI]) of adjusted geometric mean was 93.4% (87.8, 100) for AUC and 90.4% (72.2, 113) for C under fasted conditions. inf max When the 50 mg tablets were administered under fed conditions, T was slightly delayed max with a median value of 1.0 hours, compared to a median T 0.5 hours under fasted max conditions. For the 50 mg tablets fed vs. fasted, the ratio of adjusted geometric means for AUC and C was 102% (95.2, 109) and 61.5% (48.5, 77.8), respectively. inf max On Day 1 following the first morning oral dose of PF-06651600 200 mg under fasted conditions to healthy Japanese, PF-06651600 absorption was rapid with a median T of max 0.525 hours and a range of 0.500-1.00 hours. Overall, exposures as measured by AUCtau based on geometric mean were 3779 ng•hr/mL and for C of 1803 ng/mL on Day 1 after a max single dose. Mean t was 1.69 hours and it was calculated based on a 24–hour sampling. ½ Trough (predose) concentrations on Days 4, 6, 8 and 10 for all subjects were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) (<1.00 ng/mL). Following multiple oral dosing on Day 10, AUC increased slightly while C was similar tau max to Day 1. The geometric mean values for AUC and C were 4983 ng•hr/mL and tau max 1790 ng/mL, respectively. Median T was similar to Day 1 with a value of 0.500 hours max with no range for Day 10. Following the attainment of C , concentrations appeared to max decline in monophasic fashion. A short mean t was observed with an estimate of 1.8 hours. ½ Based on AUC calculation, mean apparent total body clearance of the drug from plasma tau (CL/F) was 40.1 L/hr and mean apparent volume of distribution during terminal phase after Plasma PF–06651600 accumulation was 1.3–fold for AUCtau (observed Rac) and 0.99–fold for C (observed accumulation ratio for C [R C ]). Geometric mean R was max max ac max ss 1.3 (close to 1), suggesting linear increases in PF-06651600 exposure with multiple-dose administration. Variability in plasma PF–06651600 exposure on Day 1 and Day 10 based on geometric percent coefficient of variation (%CV), ranged from 35% to 43% for C and from 23% to max 25% for AUC . tau Urinary recovery of PF-06651600 was low, with <7% of the dose recovered unchanged in urine on Day 10 (geometric mean percent of dose recovered unchanged in urine up to 24 hours [Ae %] of 6.89%). Renal clearance was approximately 46.1 mL/min. tau 1.2.3.2.2. Clinical Experience with PF-06700841 1.2.3.2.2.1. First-in-Human (B7931001) Safety Data The FIH study was a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, third party open, placebo-controlled, single and multiple dose escalation, parallel group study in healthy adult subjects and subjects with plaque psoriasis (PsO), with a relative bioavailability and food effect assessment of a tablet formulation of PF-06700841 in healthy adult subjects. In the completed first-in-human study (B7931001), 41 healthy volunteers were exposed to single doses and 26 of the 41 subjects received multiple daily doses of PF-06700841 over 10 days; a small cohort of plaque PsO patients (n=21) were treated once daily with PF-06700841 for 28 days at 30 mg and 100 mg doses. An additional healthy volunteer cohort was included to support the evaluation of the relative BA of a tablet formulation of PF-06700841, and assessment of a high fat meal on tablet BA. Twelve healthy subjects participated in this BA assessment, and received single doses of open label PF-06700841 in a 3-way cross over design (PF-0670841 tablet fasted, PF-06700841 solution/suspension fasted, and PF-06700841 tablet under fed conditions).PF-06700841 was generally safe and well tolerated in the Phase 1 clinical study B7931001. The most commonly reported all causality TEAEs across active subjects in both SAD and MAD cohorts were increased blood creatinine, and decreased neutrophil count. In the SAD period, 1 subject in the PF-06700841 100 mg group had serum creatinine (Scr) values meeting the criteria for high levels (>1.3 X ULN). In the MAD period, 4 subjects (1, 2, and 1 subjects in the PF-06700841 10 mg QD, 100 mg QD, and 50 mg BID groups, respectively) had Scr values meeting the criteria for high levels. No subjects in the psoriasis period had SCr values meeting the criteria for high levels. In the SAD period, 3 subjects (1 subject each in the PF-06700841 1 mg, 200 mg, and placebo group) had abnormal low neutrophil counts (<0.8 X LLN). In the MAD period, 14 subjects (1, 3, 3, 5, and 2 subjects in the PF-06700841 10 mg QD, 100 mg QD, 50 mg BID, 175 mg QD, and placebo group, respectively) had abnormal low neutrophil counts. In the psoriasis period, 6 subjects (1 and 5 subjects in the PF-06700841 30 mg and 100 mg QD groups, respectively) had abnormal low neutrophil counts. All laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs were mild in severity,   entire dose range. Mean t½ was 3.8-7.5 hours with a trend towards longer t½ at the higher doses, probably due to concentrations remaining above the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for a longer time as the dose increased. The mean CL/F was 10.9-28.3 L/hr and the mean V /F was 102.4-210.5 L. Variability in PF-06700841 exposure based on z geometric %CV ranged from 31%-65% for AUC and 21%-92% for C . inf max On Day 10 of multiple-dose administration, PF-06700841 was absorbed rapidly with median T at or before 1.5 hours postdose across the entire range of doses from a total daily dose of max 10 mg up to 175 mg. Plasma C and AUC both appeared to increase proportionally with max tau dose from 10 mg QD to 100 mg QD with a trend towards greater than proportional increase from 100 mg to 175 mg QD. As would be expected, dose normalized C for 50 mg BID is max slightly higher than that for 100 mg QD while dose normalized AUC is consistent between tau the two dosing regimens. Mean terminal t ranged from 4.9 to 10.7 hours. Steady state ½ generally appeared to have been reached by Day 8 of QD or BID dosing. Urinary recovery of PF-06700841 was low, with less than 16% of the dose recovered unchanged. Following multiple-dose administration in subjects with PsO, PF-06700841 was absorbed rapidly with median T of 1 to 2 hours post dose. Mean terminal t was 16 hours in the max ½ 30 mg group and 6 hours in the 100 mg group. The mean t value in the 30 mg group ½ included a reported t value of 87.5 hours for one subject with an anomalous data point at ½ 216 hours postdose. All other subjects in the dose group had concentrations below the LLOQ after 24 hours and t values of 6.48 hours or less. The subject in the 30 mg group ½ with the highest C and AUC values was not the same subject with the anomalous max tau 87.5 hour t value. CL/F and Vz/F were 30.30 L/hr and 245.4 L for the 30 mg dose, ½ respectively, and were 13.04 L/hr and 109.6 L for the 100 mg dose, respectively. Variability in PF-06700841 exposure based on geometric %CV ranged from 43% to 103% for AUCtau and 13% to 43% for C . max Relative BA of 100 mg PF-06700841 tablets compared to 100 mg oral suspension was 96.18% for AUC and 94.28% for C . Both of the 90% CIs for the ratio were within the inf max 80%-125% equivalence interval. When the 100 mg tablets were administered under fed conditions, T was delayed with a median value of 4.0 hours, compared to 0.5 hours under max fasted conditions. For 100 mg tablets fed versus fasted, the ratio (90% CI) of adjusted geometric means for AUC and C was 82.33% (73.45%, 92.29%) and 64.25% (55.98%, inf max 73.75%), respectively. Following single oral dose of PF-06700841 100 mg under fasted conditions in Japanese subjects, absorption was rapid with a median T of 1 hour and a range of 0.5-2 hours on max Day 1. Geometric mean AUC was 8725 ng•hr/mL and C was 1035 ng/mL. Mean inf max terminal t was 5.7 hours based on a 24-hour sampling. ½ On Day 10 following multiple oral dosing, median T was 0.76 hours with a range of max 0.5-4.0 hours. Both AUC and C increased slightly compared to Day 1, with geometric tau max mean values of 9888 ng•hr/mL and 1114 ng/mL, respectively. Mean terminal t was ½ 8.9 hours. Steady-state generally appeared to have been achieved by Day 6. Urinary       1.2.5. Summary of Benefits and Risks There are currently no approved treatments specifically to treat active non-segmental vitiligo. Recent case reports have suggested potential utility of JAK inhibitors in treating vitiligo as detailed in Section 1.2.1. Both PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 inhibit signal transduction pathways triggered by several cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Considering the mechanisms of action for PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 and the vitiligo pathogenesis, both IPs are expected to have a clinically meaningful effect for the treatment of active non-segmental vitiligo. The dose rationales for PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 are detailed in Sections 1.2.4.1 and 1.2.4.2, respectively. PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 are generally safe and well tolerated as supported by the totality of safety data to date. Overall, the safety profile observed during the Phase 1 program for PF-06651600 appears to be acceptable at dosages up to 200 mg administered orally QD. The safety profile observed during the Phase 1 program for PF-06700841 appears to be acceptable at dosages up to 175 mg administered orally QD. In the ongoing Phase 2a proof-of-concept Study B7931005 in adult patients with alopecia areata (AA), preliminary data showed that both PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 met its primary endpoint of improvement in severity of alopecia tool (SALT) 30 score relative to placebo at Week 24. PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 appeared generally safe and well tolerated as suggested by adverse event (AE) number and profile. Both PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 had a favorable benefit: risk profile and provided meaningful clinical benefit in AA, another dermatological disease with similar underlying pathogenesis and psychological burden as vitiligo.47,48 In the Study B7981019, events requiring review, including opportunistic infections, cardiovascular, and malignancy events will be externally evaluated using the same adjudication committee as in the ongoing Phase 2b AA Study B7981015 as detailed in Section 9.9. Based on the current clinical and nonclinical experience with PF-06651600, PF-06700841, and other information from other JAK inhibitors (eg, Xeljanz® (tofacitinib), Jakafi® (ruxolitinib), baricitinib, GLPG0634, and VX-509), the potential risks for PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 include: (1) viral reactivation; (2) serious infection and opportunistic infections; (3) malignancy and lymphoproliferative disorders; (4) decreased lymphocyte counts; (5) change in neutrophil counts; (6) decreased platelet count; (7) alterations in the lipid profile; (8) dermatologic effects (rash/acne); (9) interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction; (10) fertility, pregnancy, and lactation.  2.

A positive test on repeat is exclusionary.  Subjects with repeat indeterminate IGRA results may be enrolled after consultation with pulmonary or infectious disease specialist who determines that the risk of infection is low (ie, subject would be acceptable for immunosuppressant treatment without additional action).  Subjects who test positive for IGRA test (including borderline T-SPOT result), but in the opinion of the principal investigator (PI) are at low risk of TB infection may be referred to pulmonary or infectious disease specialist for consultation and may have the IGRA test repeated once. Subjects will be eligible if the repeat test is negative before the randomization. b. Chest radiograph taken at screening (or performed and documented within 3 months prior to Day 1) with changes suggestive of active TB infection. c. A subject who has been treated or is currently being treated for active or latent TB infection is to be excluded. d. A history of either untreated or inadequately treated latent or active TB infection is to be excluded. 26. Have galactosemia (galactose-1-phosphate-uridylyltransferase or UDP-galactose-4-epimerase or galactokinase deficiency; Fanconi Bickel syndrome), a congenital lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption. 27. Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 8 weeks prior to Day 1. 28. ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single repeat, if deemed necessary:  Hemoglobin <10.0 g/dL or hematocrit <30%;  Platelet count below the lower limit of normal (LLN) at Screening;  Absolute lymphocyte count of <0.8 x 109 /L (<800/mm3);  Serum creatinine > upper limit of normal (ULN) or eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2 based on the age appropriate calculation;  Enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values >2 times the ULN;  Total bilirubin ≥1.5 times the ULN; subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have a direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin is≤ ULN;  Creatine kinase (CK) >3 times the ULN and positive urine myoglobin;  Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >10%; Subjects whose diabetes mellitus is poorly controlled should be excluded;  In the opinion of the investigator or Pfizer (or designee), have any uncontrolled clinically significant laboratory abnormality that would affect interpretation of study data or the subject’s participation in the study. 4.3. Randomization Criteria Subjects will be randomized into the study provided they have satisfied all subject selection criteria. This study plans to enroll a total of approximately 330 subjects (expected to provide approximately 260 completers). Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group through the interactive response technology (IRT) system stratified by subject skin type, and geographical locations. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 5 active treatment groups or placebo in the ratio of 4:4:4:3:3:4 approximately. An induction dose of 200 mg QD of PF-06651600 for 4 weeks followed by maintenance dosing of 50 mg QD of PF-06651600 for 20 weeks (n=60), an induction dose of 100 mg QD of PF-06651600 for 4 weeks followed by maintenance dosing of 50 mg QD of PF-06651600 for 20 weeks (n=60), a dose of 50 mg QD of PF-06651600 for 24 weeks (n=60), a dose of 30 mg QD of PF-06651600 for 24 weeks (n=45), a dose of 10 mg QD of PF-06651600 for 24 weeks (n=45), and matching placebo for 24 weeks (n=60) will be investigated during the 24 week Dose Ranging Period.   Agree to use the sunscreen (provided by the sponsor) during the study conduct.  New tattoo that may interfere with vitiligo assessment will be prohibited during the study conduct.  For subjects who undergo color application (camouflage), or other procedures to their body surface/eyebrow/eyelash that may interfere with vitiligo assessment, the procedures should be avoided at least one week prior to the scheduled clinical assessment visits. This will facilitate the consistency of vitiligo clinical assessment.  Agree not to use makeup prior to the scheduled clinical assessment visits to facilitate the accuracy and consistency of vitiligo assessment.  Agree to avoid strenuous exercise during the study, especially within one week prior to the scheduled study visits and maintain adequate hydration, if possible. 4.4.1. Contraception In this study, fertile male subjects and female subjects who are of childbearing potential will receive PF-06651600 (and PF-06700841 in the Extension Period). PF-06700841 has been associated with demonstrated teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in animals (more details in IB). For PF-06651600 or placebo: No contraception methods are required for male subjects under PF-06651600 or placebo in the study. Female subjects who are, in the opinion of the investigator, sexually active and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must agree to use 1 method of highly effective contraception (as defined below) throughout the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. For PF-06700841: The risk of drug exposure to a sexual partner through ejaculate, vaginal secretion, or saliva from a subject on maximum oral doses of PF-06700841 at C is below pharmacologically max relevant levels, and unlikely to present a significant risk of adverse effects on embryofetal development. However, all sexually active male subjects in Group 1 who are assigned to receive PF-06700841 during the Extension Period must agree to prevent potential transfer to and exposure of partner(s) to drug through ejaculate by using a condom consistently and correctly, beginning with the first dose of investigational product and continuing for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. In addition to male condom use, a highly effective method of contraception (as defined below) should be used in women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) partners of male participants to prevent any potential for fertilization by sperm throughout the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. Female subjects in Group 1 who are assigned to receive PF-06700841 during the Extension Period and in the opinion of the investigator are sexually active and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must agree to use 1 method of highly effective contraception (as defined below) throughout the Extension Period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of PF-06700841. In addition to a highly effective method of contraception use, male partner(s) of female participants in Group 1 must agree to use a condom consistently and correctly, beginning with the first dose of investigational product and continuing for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. If the female subject under PF-06700841 chooses sexual abstinence, male condom use is not applicable. The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the subject, will confirm that the subject has selected appropriate method(s) of contraception for the individual subject and his/her partner(s) from the list of permitted contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has been instructed in their consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities, the investigator or designee will inform the subject of the need to use appropriate method(s) of contraception consistently and correctly and document the conversation, and the subject’s affirmation, in the subject’s chart. In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if 1 or both of the selected contraception methods is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the subject or partner. Highly Effective Methods : 1. Oral, injectable, or implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. 2. Intrauterine device (IUD). 3. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS). 4. Bilateral tubal occlusion or bilateral tubal ligation. 5. Vasectomized partner.  Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. The spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days. 6. Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with inhibition of ovulation used in combination with a barrier method. Acceptable barrier methods include:  Male or female condom with or without spermicide.  Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide. Male condom and female condoms should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction). 7. Sexual abstinence:  Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Additionally, contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations or guidance regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical trials. 4.5. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the study portal. To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, subject study numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subject’s participation in the study. The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The contact number is not intended for use by the subject directly, and if a subject calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site. 5. STUDY TREATMENTS For the purposes of this study, and per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved For this study, the investigational product(s) are PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 (PF-06700841 for Extension Period only). Phototherapy will be used for subjects who will be allocated to nbUVB add-on therapy during Extension Period. 5.1. Allocation to Treatment Allocation of subjects to treatment groups will occur through the use of an interactive response technology (IRT) system (interactive Web-based response [IWR]). The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the subject number. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when investigational product is being supplied via the IRT system. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the subject number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. The study-specific IRT reference manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system. 5.2. Breaking the Blind The study will be double blind (sponsor, subject and investigator blinded) during the Dose Ranging Period. During the Extension Period, the group 1 (PF-06700841 arm) and group 2 (PF-06651600 with nbUVB arm) will be open label while the other 3 arms (group 3, 4 and 5) will be double blind. Group 6 is for observation only. No IP will be administered. At the initiation of the study, the investigator site will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The method will be an electronic process. Blinding codes should be broken only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment code is absolutely essential for further management of the subject. Investigators are encouraged to discuss with a member of the study team if they believe that unblinding is necessary. However, discussion with a member of the study team in advance of unblinding is not required. When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully documented and entered on the case report form (CRF). Details of unblinding plan for possible interim analysis will be specified in interim analysis plan. 5.3. Subject Compliance For self-administration of PF-06651600 or PF-06700841 at home, subject compliance will be verified by the accounting of investigational product at each visit. When investigational product is administered at the study site, it will be administered under the supervision of study personnel. Compliance of the investigational product will be monitored by delegated site personnel by the accounting of unused medication returned by the subject at the study visits. Compliance will be documented on the source document. If compliance is <80% or >120%, the investigator or designee is to counsel the subject and ensure steps are taken to improve compliance. Subjects interrupting investigational product for more than 4 consecutive days or for a total of more than 7 days between visits are to be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study. 5.4. Investigational Product Supplies 5.4.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging Blinded PF-06651600 tablets and matching placebos will be provided as tablets for oral administration. PF-06700841 will be provided as tablets for oral administration. The designation “PF-06651600-15” and “PF-06700841-15” may appear on labeling and indicates a salt. The PF-06651600 10 mg and 50 mg tablets and their matching placebos will be supplied in blisters and labeled according to local regulatory requirements. The PF-06700841 5 mg and 25 mg tablets will be supplied in bottles and labeled according to local regulatory requirements. Subjects will receive blinded labeled supplies for PF-06651600 throughout the study including the Extension Period. PF-06700841 supplies will be open label. 5.4.2. Preparation and Dispensing The investigational product (IP) will be dispensed using an IRT drug management system at each visit according to Schedule of Activities. A qualified staff member will dispense the investigational product via unique container numbers on the bottles or blister labels provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule. The subject/caregiver should be instructed to maintain the product in bottles or blisters provided throughout the course of dosing and return the bottles or blisters to the site at the next study visit. 5.5. Administration Subjects will receive IP as outpatients. PF-06651600 tablets and matching placebo for oral administration will be dispensed in blisters. PF-06700841 tablets for oral administration will be dispensed in bottles. Subjects will be provided clear dosing instructions. Sites will be trained on how subjects should take tablets at home through an IP manual and/or other vehicle(s). Sites are responsible for communicating this information and site staff should review the dosing instructions with subjects at every study visit. Subjects should take the medication orally once daily; Subjects should swallow the tablets with ambient temperature water to a total volume of approximately 240 mL (2.4 DL or 1 cup); Subjects will swallow the investigational product whole, and will not manipulate or chew the medication prior to swallowing; Subjects will be encouraged to take the medication after breakfast whenever possible even though IP may be taken with or without food; however, for study visit days, subjects are to be instructed to refrain from dosing at home, and are to take the dose in the clinic (from the containers being returned to If a dose is missed and the interval to the next dose is less than 8 hours, the missed dose should not be administered. Study treatment may be temporarily withheld (or adjusted) for a maximum of 4 consecutive days at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects interrupting investigational product for more than 4 consecutive days or 7 days between visits are to be discussed with the sponsor for possible withdrawal from the study. 5.6. Investigational Product Storage The investigator or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all investigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with the labels. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded by the storage conditions stated on the product label. Site systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room-temperature products). This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study. Even for continuous-monitoring systems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available. The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all non-working days upon return to normal operations. The operation of the temperature-monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularly inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order. Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to Pfizer. Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the investigational product. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to Pfizer approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site. Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where the products are briefly out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not Site staff will instruct subjects on the proper storage requirements for take home investigational products. 5.7. Investigational Product Accountability The investigator site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the investigational product supplies. All investigational products will be accounted for using a drug accountability form/record. All IPs must be returned to the investigator by the subject at every applicable visit and at the end of the trial. 5.7.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational product (eg, at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Pfizer, and all destruction must be adequately documented. For all blisters/bottles returned to the investigator by the subject, the investigator will maintain the returned supply until destruction is authorized. Pfizer will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused investigational product. 5.8. Concomitant Treatment(s) Medications that are taken in the Screening period (after informed consent is obtained and before the first dose of IP) will be documented as prior medications. Medications taken after the first dose of IP has been administered will be documented as concomitant medications. All concomitant medications taken during the study must be recorded in study records with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration. Subjects will be queried about concomitant medication (including topical medications and treatments, over-the-counter and prescription medications and treatments, and vaccinations) at each study visit. Any new concomitant medications or dose changes to current concomitant medications should be evaluated for potential new or worsening adverse events. The start date, stop date, and indication for all therapies will be recorded on the CRF. 5.8.1. Narrow Band Ultraviolet B Light (nbUVB) The use of narrow band ultraviolet b light (nbUVB) phototherapy may be an important component in the Extension Period to enhance melanocyte growth and differentiation. In the Extension Period, subjects who have signed a consent form for the nbUVB will have a chance to receive an induction dose of 200 mg QD plus standardized nbUVB add-on therapy for 4 weeks followed by maintenance dosing of 50 mg QD plus standardized nbUVB add-on therapy for 20 weeks. This arm will be an unblinded arm since the other 4 arms in the Extension Period will not use nbUVB. Sun exposure is prohibited during nbUVB phototherapy.

Subjects who have <10% improvement in percent change in VASI at Extension Week 12 from baseline at Week 24 Dose Ranging Period will be discontinued from the treatment and enter Follow-up Period. 5.8.2. Permitted Concomitant Medications Acetaminophen may be used intermittently (not to exceed 1 g/day). For the purposes of this protocol, dietary supplements are defined as vitamins, minerals, and purified food substances with pharmaceutical properties. Vitamins, minerals and purified food substances are allowed in amounts not known to be associated with adverse effects (such as hypervitaminosis). A subject who is receiving metformin as concomitant medication must allow at least two hours to elapse after taking the medication and before taking investigational product. A subject who is receiving a permitted concomitant medication for any reason must be on a locally-approved medication and dose for the treated indication, and this must be documented in the CRF. Subjects are not allowed any other investigational drugs or treatments during the study. Subjects should refrain from starting new or changing doses of permitted prescription or non-prescription drugs, vitamins, and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1 and throughout the study, unless otherwise noted below. Subjects will be provided a sunscreen at the Baseline Visit. Subjects will use the sunscreen Day 1 through to the End of Study Visit as needed. If a subject has a history of intolerability or currently does not tolerate the sunscreen or if the product is unavailable, the investigator should contact the Pfizer clinician or designee for approval to use an alternative topical sunscreen; The approved alternative sunscreen should be documented in study records. Subjects should report any changes to permitted medications during the study to the investigator as soon as they occur. Medication changes must be documented in the subject’s record and CRF. Unless a prohibited medication or treatment, subjects may be administered any other medications necessary for the treatment of concomitant medical disorders as deemed necessary by the treating physician. Following Day 1, addition of concomitant medications or any change in the dosage should be limited to those considered medically essential. 5.8.3. Prohibited Medications and Treatments Subjects will abstain from all concomitant medications as described in the Inclusion and Exclusion sections of the protocol and Appendix 2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications. Subjects should be instructed at each visit to contact the study site investigator promptly if there are any intended changes or additions to concomitant medications. A subject who is receiving simvastatin as concomitant medication should be switched at least 7 days prior to baseline to an alternative statin drug. Treatment with simvastatin-containing products should not be initiated during participation in this study. All medications and treatments that could affect vitiligo must be discontinued. Subjects must also avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and avoid the use of tanning booths, sun lamps or other ultraviolet light sources other than provided/requested by the study team during the study. Herbals supplements are only allowed on a case-by-case basis; please contact the Pfizer staff. Herbal medications with unknown properties or known beneficial effects for vitiligo or that are known to have an effect on drug metabolism (eg, St. John’s Wort) must be discontinued at least 1 week or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of investigational product. Restrictions on certain vaccinations are described in Section 5.8.4. 5.8.4. Vaccinations Vaccination with live virus, attenuated live virus, or any live viral components is prohibited within the 6 weeks prior to the first dose of IP, during the study, and for 6 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Similarly, current routine household contact with individuals who have been vaccinated with live vaccine components should be avoided during treatment and for 6 weeks following completion of treatment. Such vaccines include but are not limited to: FluMist® (intranasal influenza vaccine), attenuated rotavirus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, attenuated typhoid fever vaccine, oral polio vaccine, MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and vaccinia (smallpox) vaccine. Following vaccination with live component vaccines, the virus may be shed in bodily fluids, including stool, and there is a potential risk that the virus may be transmitted. 5.8.5. Rescue Medication Since currently there are no approved treatments in vitiligo (other than phototherapy), no rescue therapy will be mandated by the sponsor. Subjects requiring rescue medication during the Dose Ranging Period or Extension Period will be discontinued from IP (PF-06651600 or PF-06700841 or placebo) and will enter the Follow-up Period. Subjects requiring rescue medication during the Follow-up Period should also complete the Follow-up Period. 6. STUDY PROCEDURES Refer to the Schedule of Activity for a detailed list of study procedures as they should be conducted at each respective visit. Visit windows are based on Day 1 visit.  For screening procedures, see Schedule of Activities and Section 7. 6.2. Dose Ranging Period For treatment period procedures, see Schedule of Activities Table 1 and Section 7. 6.3. Extension Period For subjects in Group 1 (who are assigned to receive PF-06700841 in the Extension Period) procedures, see Schedule of Activities Table 2 and Section 7. For subjects in Group 2 (who are assigned to receive narrow band UVB (nbUVB) add-on therapy in the Extension Period procedures, see Schedule of Activities Table 3 and Section 7. For subjects in Groups 3, 4, and 5 (who receive all other assignments [except for nbUVB add-on therapy or PF-06700841] in the Extension Period) procedures, see Schedule of Activities Table 4 and Section 7. For subjects in Group 6 (observation only) procedures, see Schedule of Activities Table 5 and Section 7. 6.4. Follow-up Period including End of Study Follow-up Visit 1 will occur 4 weeks after the Extension Week 24 (ExW24). End of Study Visit will occur 4 weeks after the FU Visit 1 or Early Termination (ET) Visit. For early terminated subjects, End of Study (EOS) Visit will occur 4 weeks (with a visit window of +7 days based on the ET Visit) after the Early Termination (ET) Visit and no FU1 Visit will be performed. The procedures scheduled for ET Visit will be performed on the last day the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible thereafter. For follow-up and end of study procedures, see Schedule of Activities Table 6 and Section 7. 6.5. Subject Withdrawal/Early Termination Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol-required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site. Subjects who are requested to discontinue study treatment from the Dose Ranging Period or Extension Period (except for Group 6) will enter into the Follow-up Period with their End of Study Visit occurring 4 weeks after the ET Visit. The procedures scheduled for ET Visit will be performed on the last day the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible thereafter. Subjects in Group 6 who requested to discontinue study from the Extension Period will have the End of Study Visit occurring 4 weeks after the last visit. No See Appendix 5 for guidelines on subject safety monitoring and discontinuation. The ET Visit only applies to subjects who are randomized, received at least one dose of IP, and then are prematurely withdrawn from the study treatment. If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the subject. All attempts to contact the subject and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the subject’s medical record. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs). Withdrawal of consent: Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study treatment from the Treatment Period or Extension Period will enter the Follow-up Period with their EOS visit occurring 4 weeks after the ET Visit and to be followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The procedures scheduled for ET Visit will be performed on the last day the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible thereafter. The only exception to this is when a subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the subject to provide this information. Subjects should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of investigational product or also from study procedures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law. If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. Lost to follow-up: All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the subject after a minimum of 2 documented phone calls, faxes, or e-mails as well as lack of response by the subject to 1 registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third-party representative to assist in the follow-up portion of the study has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor-retained third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining the subject’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up portion of the study. The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If, after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow-up, then the last-known-alive date as determined by the investigator should be reported and documented in the subject’s medical records. Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced at the discretion of the investigator upon consultation with the sponsor. 7. ASSESSMENTS Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol-required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the subject. When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study. 7.1. Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy tests are required to be done (if applicable) as specified in the Schedule of Activities. All pregnancy tests used in this study, either urine or serum, must have a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL and must be performed by a certified laboratory. For female subjects of childbearing potential, 2 negative pregnancy tests are required before receiving study treatment(s) (1 negative pregnancy test at screening and 1 at the baseline visit immediately before study treatment administration). Following a negative pregnancy test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and the second negative pregnancy test result will then be required at the baseline visit before the subject may receive the study treatment. In the absence of regular menstrual bleeding, the study candidate should have used 1 form of contraception for at least 1 month before the second pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests will also be repeated at every applicable visit and at the end of the study to confirm that the subject has not become pregnant during the study. Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period and when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected, and may be repeated if requested by institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations. In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject will be withdrawn from administration of investigational product but may remain in the study for follow up.   Subjects should be seated in a chair, back supported, and arms bared (free of restrictions such as rolled-up sleeves, etc.) and supported at heart level. Measurements should be taken on the same arm at each visit (preferably non-dominant). Subjects should refrain from smoking or ingesting caffeine during the 30 minutes preceding the measurements. Measurements should begin after at least 5 minutes of rest. Pulse should be measured at approximately the same time as BP for a minimum of 30 seconds. When the timing of BP and pulse (heart) rate measurements coincides with a blood collection or other study procedure, BP and pulse (heart) rate should be obtained first. 7.3.2. Medical History, Physical Exam, Height, and Weight Complete vitiligo disease history includes collection of details of vitiligo at Screening: background, vitiligo history, vitiligo diagnosis, the use of topical treatments, systemic treatments and other treatments for vitiligo (up to 2 years, if possible). Medical history, in addition to vitiligo history, including history of drug (up to 2 years, if possible), alcohol, tobacco use, auditory, skin rash, skin infection, and any dermal abnormalities that may predispose to infection will be collected at Screening and Baseline (if applicable). Smoking status and average weekly alcohol consumption (units/week) will also be collected. Height and weight will be measured without the subject wearing shoes. Height (inches or centimeters) and weight (lbs or kgs) will be measured and recorded in the source document at the Baseline Visit. Complete physical examinations must be performed by the investigator, sub-investigator or a qualified health professional per local guidelines. Complete physical examinations consist of assessments of general appearance; skin; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (HEENT); mouth, heart; lungs; breast (optional); abdomen; external genitalia (optional); extremities; neurologic function, back, and lymph nodes. In addition, dermatological full body exam must be performed by the investigator, sub-investigator or a qualified health professional per local guidelines. Dermatological examinations may include visual inspection of the breasts and external genitalia. Targeted physical examinations must be performed by the investigator, sub-investigator or a qualified health professional per local guidelines and should include skin, heart, lung, neurologic function, and abdomen and examination of body systems where there are symptom complaints by the subject. Subjects with clinically meaningful changes from baseline in neurologic signs or symptoms should be referred to a neurologist to undergo a formal neurologic evaluation. Complete and Targeted physical examinations are performed at various time points, see Schedules of Activities. 7.3.3. Chest Radiography Chest X-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral views are recommended, however local guidelines should be followed) or other appropriate diagnostic image (ie, computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) with no evidence of abnormalities including but not limited to current, active TB or previous inactive TB, general infections, heart failure or malignancy taken at Screening or within 12 weeks prior to Study Day 1 and read by a qualified radiologist. Documentation of the official reading must be located and available in the source documentation. 7.3.4. Electrocardiogram Single 12-lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the Schedule of Activities. All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly for at least 10 minutes in a supine position and prior to any blood collection. The baseline ECG values will serve as each subject’s baseline values. To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified medical personnel at the investigator site will make comparisons to baseline measurements. A paper or digital copy of the ECG should be filed in the subject’s chart and must be available to the sponsor upon request. Any clinically significant changes will be recorded and evaluated further, as clinically warranted. In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. 7.3.5. Tuberculosis Testing Subjects could be screened for TB using either test listed below. 7.3.5.1. Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) Tuberculin Test Subjects may be screened for TB using an IGRA per local guidelines. Interferon gamma release assay will be tested during screening or within 12 weeks prior to Day 1. The following are acceptable IGRA assays: QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (QFT-G), QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-GIT) and T-SPOT® TB test. Site personnel should follow the processing and analyses steps based on the assay chosen. Ensure incubation steps are followed as appropriate. An IGRA is preferred for subjects with a prior BCG vaccination, but may be used for any subject. Documentation of IGRA product used and the test result must be in the subject’s source documentation. If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may be repeated, and if a negative result is obtained, enrollment may proceed. A positive test on repeat is exclusionary. Subjects with repeat indeterminate IGRA results may be enrolled after consultation with pulmonary or infectious disease specialist that determines low risk of infection (ie, subject would be acceptable for immunosuppressant (eg, anti-TNF) treatment without additional Subjects who test positive for IGRA test (including borderline T-SPOT result), but in the opinion of the PI are at low risk of TB infection may be referred to pulmonary or infectious disease specialist for consultation and potential IGRA test repeated once. Subjects will be eligible if the repeat test is negative before the randomization. Refer to lab manual for any additional processing information and shipping instructions. 7.3.5.2. Mantoux/Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) Tuberculin Skin Test Subjects can be TB screened using the Mantoux/PPD Tuberculin Skin Test. Mantoux/PPD testing can also be performed if there are indeterminate QFT-G test results. Subjects must have a Mantoux/PPD tuberculin skin test administered and then evaluated by a health care professional 48 to 72 hours later. A positive Mantoux/PPD tuberculin skin test is exclusionary. 7.3.6. Special Safety Assessment 7.3.6.1. Dermatological Events All subjects will have dermatological full body exam (s) per SOA. Skin lesions will be evaluated and managed as defined in the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0) (Appendix 4). 7.3.6.1.1. Herpetiform Rash For any occurrence of a suspected herpetiform rash (eg, herpes zoster and herpes simplex), specimens for viral DNA analysis will be obtained: A swab of the affected area will be collected for confirmation; a blood sample for viral surveillance will be collected for the analysis of viral load. Details for these collections will be provided in the laboratory manual. 7.3.6.1.2. Drug-Related Rash All potential drug-related reports of rash will be followed up until resolution or clinically stable or in agreement with the sponsor. All events of rash should be treated according to International and local guidelines for the treatment of rash, eg, where appropriate, topical corticosteroids and/or agents such as antibiotics or antivirals could be prescribed. All subjects reporting an unexplained skin rash should undergo a formal comprehensive dermatologic evaluation. A 4 mm punch biopsy will be taken unless there is a clear, non-drug related etiology (eg, infection, pre-existing condition) or other clinical rationale (eg, if the rash is present on the face it may not be appropriate to take a biopsy) or subject refuse to have biopsy performed. The biopsy will be sent to the local laboratory for histological investigation of the rash in order to gain insight into potential etiology of the rash. Note: For herpetiform rash, no biopsy is required. Please see Section 7.3.6.1.1. In addition to a biopsy of suspected drug-related rash, a swab (for microbiological assessment) of the affected area will also be taken for culture and sensitivity to assess (at the local laboratory) for any bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens, if applicable. A blood sample for viral surveillance will be collected (and sent to the central laboratory) for the analysis of viral load including but not limited to cytomegalovirus (CMV), EBV, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV), if applicable. Subjects reporting potential drug-related rash should assess itch on a 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS) provided by Pfizer where 0 is no itching and 10 is worst possible itching (Appendix 8). The investigator will enter this assessment into the data collection tool. Investigators will complete a questionnaire (provided by the study team) and take appropriate photographs of the rash. All de-identified biopsy results, culture results, photographs, and any additional relevant test results will be forwarded to Pfizer (or designee) for review within 30 days of receipt by the investigator. An independent dermatologist contracted by Pfizer may review all relevant data and summarize the data at the end of the study. 7.3.6.2. Creatinine, Cystatin C, and estimates of Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) Serum creatinine is the best known standard test for monitoring renal function. However, serum creatinine based estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may be affected by factors other than renal function, including chronic and acute illness. Serum cystatin C is a test that can be used either as an adjunct to or a replacement for serum creatinine. The most reliable estimates of GFR use both test results.12 Serum cystatin C is a low molecular weight protein that is used as an alternative to serum creatinine for monitoring of renal function. It seems to correlate more closely with GFR than serum creatinine concentration and may be a more sensitive detector of early renal dysfunction.4,24 While use of cystatin C has been limited, its independence of demographic factors (eg, race) has made it an interesting means of determining changes in renal function in clinical settings and it is included in the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Estimated GFR may be calculated via the 2012 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine, cystatin C, or creatinine-Cystatin C equations.14 Serum creatinine will be measured as part of serum chemistry at times specified in the Schedule of Activities section of the protocol. Creatinine elevations above the ULN will be followed until resolution or baseline. Serum creatinine based eGFR will be calculated. Serum cystatin C will be measured and cystatin C based eGFR will be calculated at times specified in the Schedule of Activities section of the protocol. The eGFR will be calculated using the 2 sets of equations developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), which utilize serum creatinine (SCr) and serum Cystatin C (S Cystatin C) respectively.34 7.3.7. Audiometry All subjects will have audiometry assessment at times specified in the Schedule of Activities. Audiometry assessment taken at Screening or within 8 weeks prior to Day 1 must have results available prior to Day 1. In addition to audiogram, information including auditory medical history and additional examinations (ie, otoscopic exam) will be collected. For subjects that terminate early from the study, efforts must be made to complete the audiometry testing and obtain the results. When possible, the subject should have the audiogram performed at the same evaluation center during the study. At subsequent visits, audiograms will be performed; based upon results, additional audiometry assessments may be required and performed by qualified medical personnel based on local guideline or equivalent. If there is a clinically-meaningful, treatment-related decline in hearing from baseline, the subject will be followed up off treatment with appropriate testing at regular intervals, until hearing returns to baseline or is determined to be clinically stable. Treatment-relatedness (or causality) will be assessed by the investigator as described in Section 8.1.5. The information from the audiogram will be entered into the data collection tool. Any de-identified audiogram results/reports and any additional relevant test results (if applicable) will be requested to be forwarded to Pfizer (and/or designee) at any time during the study. 7.3.8. Clinical Laboratory Tests 7.3.8.1. Blood Volume Further details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of the blood samples will be provided in the lab manual. 7.3.8.2. Laboratory Tests The following laboratory tests will be performed at time points identified in the Schedule of Activities. Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns at the investigator’s discretion. Sample collection, labeling, storage, and shipping information can be found in the laboratory manual. All laboratory tests with clinically important changes from baseline identified after administration of investigational product will be followed until the value stabilizes.  Subjects must abstain from all food and drink (except water and non-investigational product s) for an 8-hour overnight fast prior to fasting lipid profile panel collection according to Schedule of Activities. All other labs CCI do not require fasting.   Scalp, neck, eyebrows, eyelashes, and vermilion will be excluded from this calculation, although total VASI assessment includes all of these regions. Details of the central read process, including the information flow will be described in a separate charter/exploratory analysis plan. 7.4.2. Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) The total body VASI will be assessed by the Investigator. The total body VASI will be calculated using a formula that includes contribution from all body regions (possible range, 0-100) with a modified method described by Hamzavi et al:9 Ʃ VASI = [Hand Units] X [Depigmentation] Six (6) Different Body Sites Percent of total body surface area (BSA) is determined by hand units. One hand unit, which encompasses the palm plus the volar surface of all the digits, is approximately 1% of the total body surface area and is used as a guide to estimate the baseline percentage of vitiligo involvement of each body region. The body will be divided into 6 separate and mutually exclusive regions: face/neck, hands, upper extremities (excluding hands), trunk, lower extremities (excluding the feet), and feet. The axillary regions are included with the upper extremities, while the buttocks and inguinal regions are included with the lower extremities. Genital area is included in trunk. Face and neck lesions will be measured in this study. The extent of depigmentation is expressed by the following percentages: 0, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, or 100%. At 100% depigmentation, no pigment is present; at 90%, specks of pigment are present; at 75%, the depigmented exceeded the pigmented area; at 50%, the depigmented and pigmented areas are equal; at 25%, the pigmented area exceeded the depigmented area; and at 10%, only specks of depigmentation are present. 7.4.3. Facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (Facial-VASI)-Site Assessment The site assessed facial-VASI will be assessed by the Investigator. The site assessment of the facial-VASI is calculated using a formula that is similar to facial-VASI central read. It includes contribution from face (possible range, 0.00-4.00). Scalp, neck, eyebrows, eyelashes, and vermilion will be excluded from this calculation, although total VASI assessment includes all of these regions. Facial VASI = [Digit Units] X [Depigmentation] X0.1 The volar surface of one digit (the subject’s thumb) is approximately 0.1% of the total body surface area and was used as a guide to estimate the baseline percentage of vitiligo involvement of face. The extent of depigmentation is expressed by the following percentages: 0, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, or 100%. At 100% depigmentation, no pigment is present; at 90%, specks of pigment are present; at 75%, the depigmented exceeded the pigmented area; at 50%, the depigmented and pigmented areas are equal; at 25%, the pigmented area exceeded the depigmented area; and at 10%, only specks of depigmentation are present. 7.4.4. Static Investigator Global Assessment (sIGA) Static Investigator Global Assessment (sIGA) Score 7.4.5. Body Surface Area (BSA) The number of hand units of skin afflicted with vitiligo in a body region can be used to determine the extent (%) to which a body region is involved with vitiligo. When measuring, the hand unit refers to the size of each individual subject’s palm plus the volar surface of all the digits in a closed position. Rule of 9 is used to estimate BSA (Head/neck 9%; Upper extremities excluding hands 14%; Hands 4%; trunk including genital area 33%; Lower extremities excluding feet 36%; Feet 4%). 7.4.6. Vitiligo Extent Score (VES) Vitiligo Extent Score is a measure to express the overall vitiligo involvement of the body (extent).31 Clinical illustrations for 19 separate body areas that reflect different degrees of involvement (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 75% depigmentation) are chosen to represent the subject’s skin lesions to get the total extent of the disease (Appendix 6). VES is a sum of all surface measurement that is similar to VASI. 7.4.7. Dermoscopy Dermoscopy will be performed per SOA. At least 2 different anatomical regions based on VES will be selected on Screening. At least two fields (possibly peripheral and central) from the largest lesion in the selected anatomical region will be examined to determine if white hair is present in less than 30% of hair in the depigmented lesion. Number of fields with less than 30% of white hair will be recorded. The same chosen lesions will be assessed per SOA. The same dermoscopy should be used throughout the study. 7.4.8. Target Lesion(s) Assessment One isolated and completed stable lesion (if applicable) will be identified as the stable target lesion on Day 1. Photographs of the lesion will be obtained (according to the separately provided Photography Instructions) at various time points as per SOA (Section 7.7). The extent of depigmentation of the target lesion is expressed by the following percentages: 0, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, or 100%. At 100% depigmentation, no pigment is present; at 90%, specks of pigment are present; at 75%, the depigmented exceeds the pigmented area; at 50%, the depigmented and pigmented areas are equal; at 25%, the pigmented area exceeded the depigmented area; and at 10%, only specks of depigmentation are present. The same target lesion will be assessed per SOA. Note: No depigmentation (0) may be achieved during the study but should not be observed on Day 1. In case of mixed Vitiligo, one isolated segmental vitiligo lesion (if applicable) will be identified as the segmental target lesion on Day 1. Photographs of the lesion will be obtained (according to the separately provided Photography Instructions) at various time points as per Schedule of Activities (Section 7.7). The extent of depigmentation of the target lesion is expressed by the following percentages: 0, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, or 100%. At 100% depigmentation, no pigment is present; at 90%, specks of pigment are present; at 75%, the depigmented exceeds the pigmented area; at 50%, the depigmented and pigmented areas are equal; at 25%, the pigmented area exceeded the depigmented area; and at 10%, only specks of depigmentation are present. The same target lesion will be assessed per SOA. Note: No depigmentation (0) may be achieved during the study but should not be observed on Day 1. Target lesion assessment for active vitiligo lesion is not required. Photographs of active lesion, stable lesion, and segmental vitiligo lesion (if applicable) will be obtained according to SOA (Section 7.7). 7.5. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a validated tool to evaluate suicidal ideation and behavior (Appendix 6). At Screening Visit and Baseline Visit, if there are “yes” answers on items 4, 5 in the past year or on any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C-SSRS in the past 5 years, the subject will not be included in the study. At any post-baseline visits during Dosing Ranging Period or Extension Period, if there are “yes” answers on items 4, 5 or on any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C-SSRS, the subject will be discontinued from the IP and referred to a mental health professional for appropriate evaluation and treatment. If the subject cannot be seen by a mental health professional within 24 hours, then the subject should be sent to a local emergency room for psychiatric assessment. 7.6. Patient Report Outcome (PRO) Measures Every effort should be made to have the subject complete all patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires before any other evaluations. All PROs should be completed in the order specified in as following: SA-VES, VitiQoL, DLQI, HADS, PHQ-8, PGIC-V, EQ-5D-5L, HCRU and VNS, at those visits where they are to be administered except for Screening Visit and Baseline Visit. All of the PROs are administered as electronic version on a tablet with the exception of the VNS which will be administered as a paper version. 7.6.1. Self-Assessment Vitiligo Extent Score (SA-VES) The Self-Assessment Vitiligo Extent Score (SA-VES) is a validated patient report outcome measurement instrument to provide information about disease extent. SA-VES should be completed as per Schedule of Activities. 7.6.2. Vitiligo-Specific Quality of Life (VitiQoL) and Patient Global Impression of Severity of Vitiligo (PGIS-V) The Vitiligo-Specific Quality of Life Instrument (VitiQoL) is a reliable and validated vitiligo disease-specific HRQoL instrument which measures concepts relevant to vitiligo subjects. The VitiQoL is a 15-item PRO measure which measures concepts of symptoms, daily activities, leisure activities, work, personal relationships and treatment. Responses range from “not at all” (scored 0) to “most of the time” (scored 6) and gives a minimum and maximum score from 0-90, with higher scores representing greater burden. A minimally important difference has not yet been established for the questionnaire. The VitiQoL should be completed as per Schedule of Activities. The Patient Global Impression of Severity of Vitiligo (PGIS-V) is 1-item within the VitiQoL questionnaire which asks the subject to determine how severe they feel their skin condition is at that point in time on a 7-point Likert response from “no skin involvement” to “most severe case”. 7.6.3. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) The DLQI is a general dermatology questionnaire that consists of 10 items that assess subject health-related quality of life (daily activities, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, leisure, work and school, and treatment). The DLQI is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument that has been translated into several languages, and the DLQI total scores have been shown to be responsive to change. The minimal clinically important difference for the DLQI has been estimated as a 2 to 5 point change from baseline. The DLQI should be completed as per Schedule of Activities. 7.6.4. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) The HADS is a 14-item PRO measure used to detect states of anxiety and depression over the past week. Items are rated on a 4-point severity scale. The HADS produces two scales, one for anxiety (HADS–A) and one for depression (HADS–D), differentiating the two states. Scores of greater than or equal to 11 on either scale indicate a definitive case. The HADS should be completed as per Schedule of Activities. 7.6.5. Patient Health Questionnaire – 8 items (PHQ-8) Patient Health Questionnaire – 8 items is a patient-reported outcomes questionnaire which consists of 8 items to screen for the subject depression level. The PHQ-8 should be completed at the Screening Visit. At Screening Visit, if PHQ-8 total score ≥15, the subject will not be included in the study. 7.6.6. Patient Global Impression of Change- Vitiligo (PGIC-V) The PGIC-V is a 1-item questionnaire is designed to assess a subject’s impression of disease improvement relative to before the intervention on a 7 point Likert scale ranging from “Very much improved” to “Very much worse” with “no change” in the middle. The PGIC-V should be completed as per Schedule of Activities. 7.6.7. EQ-5D-5L The EQ-5D-5L and VAS is a validated, standardized, generic instrument that is the most widely used preference-based health-related quality of life questionnaire in cost-effectiveness and health technologies assessment (HTA).5,11,15,32 The measure is a well-established instrument used to measure health states and utilities in various diseases areas. The measure contains five items that cover mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression as well as a VAS to assess overall health status. The EQ-5D-5L should be completed as per Schedule of Activities. 7.6.8. Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) In order to get an assessment of the subject’s Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU), subjects will be asked about the number of visits and use of the healthcare system outside of that provided within the clinical trial. Questions will be asked to gauge any hospitalizations, surgical procedures, or medical visits stratified by those which are vitiligo related or not.     7.12. Rater Qualifications Clinical evaluations of vitiligo will be performed by an experienced and qualified dermatologist (board certified or equivalent). An experienced and qualified non-dermatologist physician or experienced medical professional with experience in the conduct of vitiligo clinical trials may be permitted to perform the clinical evaluations of vitiligo when designated by primary site investigator. The evaluator must receive and document protocol specific and applicable efficacy assessment scales training prior to performing these evaluations. To assure consistency and reduce variability, the same evaluator must assess all dermatological clinical evaluations for any individual subject throughout the study whenever possible; a back-up experienced and qualified, protocol-trained evaluator will only be allowed and documented in case of emergency or special situations when the designated evaluator is unable to perform the evaluation. 7.13. Sun Exposure Check The sun exposure information will be captured daily via electronic-diary (E-diary) as per Schedule of Activities. Compliance of E-diary will be monitored. Delegated site staff will review compliance with subjects at each visit and counsel as appropriate. If a subject has repeated non-compliance, the subject should be re-trained. If a subject is unable to complete the E-diary due to documented technical disability or other limitation, the subject will be permitted to enter or remain in the study. No deviations will be recorded in regards to E-diary compliance. 7.14. Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment The skin type assessment will be done at the Screening visit using the Fitzpatrick Skin Phototype assessment (Appendix 9). This is used to classify a person’s skin type by their response to sun exposure (ie, burning or tanning). 7.15. Requests for Results of Tests and Procedures Not Part of the Study (if applicable) If during the event adjudication (Section 9.9), the specific documents are needed to support event adjudication by the Adjudication/Review Committees, additional tests or procedures that are not part of the study but that could be related to the study may be requested. Copies of the reports of these tests may be requested. Event documentation will vary with the event requiring adjudication and may include (but not be limited to): hospital discharge summaries, operative reports, clinic notes, diagnostic tests, pathology reports, autopsy reports and death certificate information, as applicable. 8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 8.1. Requirements The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safety events on the CRF and for reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to Pfizer Safety. These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following paragraphs. Events listed in the table above that require reporting to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator are to be reported regardless of whether the event is determined by the investigator to be related to an investigational product under study. In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer Safety must be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available event information. This time frame also applies to additional new (follow-up) information on previously forwarded reports. In the rare situation that the investigator does not become immediately aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the event. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (see the Serious Adverse Events section below). In addition, the investigator may be requested by Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow-up information in an expedited fashion. This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF. In general, this will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety. Any pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory data) are to be sent to Pfizer Safety ONLY upon request. As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the sponsor, any non-serious AE that is determined by the sponsor to be serious will be reported by the sponsor as an SAE. To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study. 8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information. 8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a non-leading manner. 8.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject Withdrawal/Early Termination section) Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. When a subject withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the Requirements section above. 8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product. For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. 8.1.4.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form. SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product must be reported to Pfizer Safety. Follow up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.4.2. Recording Non-serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF. Follow-up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.5. Causality Assessment The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by the sponsor. If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related” to investigational product, this should be clearly documented on study records. In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements. 8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. 8.2. Definitions 8.2.1. Adverse Events An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to:  Abnormal test findings;  Clinically significant signs and symptoms;  Changes in physical examination findings;  Hypersensitivity;  Progression/worsening of underlying disease;  Drug abuse;  Drug dependency. Additionally, AEs may include signs and symptoms resulting from:  Drug overdose;  Drug withdrawal;  Drug misuse;  Drug interactions;  Extravasation;  Exposure during pregnancy (EDP);  Exposure via breastfeeding;  Medication error;  Occupational exposure. 8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when any of the following conditions are met:  Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or  Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or  Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of any protocol-specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or  Test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or sponsor. Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require recording as an AE. 8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  Results in death;  Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions);  Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Or that is considered to be:  An important medical event. Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4. Adverse Reactions and Serious Adverse Reactions An adverse reaction (AR) is any untoward and unintended responses to an investigational medicinal product (IMP) related to any dose administered. This implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the IMP. A serious adverse reaction (SAR) is an adverse reaction which meets the criterion of ‘seriousness’ as described in Section 8.2.3. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious adverse reactions (SARs) that are unexpected per the reference safety information (RSI) in the respective IBs for PF-06651600 and PF-06700841. 8.2.5. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility, or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for medical importance. Hospitalization does not include the following:  Rehabilitation facilities;  Hospice facilities;  Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);  Skilled nursing facilities;  Nursing homes;  Same-day surgeries (as outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include:  Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory abnormality);  Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);  Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);  Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg, for a procedure required by the study protocol);  Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective cosmetic surgery);  Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject. Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as SAEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 8.3. Severity Assessment Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above. 8.4. Special Situations 8.4.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events There are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported to Pfizer Safety by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety database. 8.4.1.1. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal (× ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 × ULN) by several days or weeks. The increase in TBili typically occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated In rare instances, by the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Subjects who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:  Subjects with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value >2 × ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2 × ULN or not available;  For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:  Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller;  Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value by an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × ULN (whichever is smaller). Rises in AST/ALT and TBili separated by more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT and TBili, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology. A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either by itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over-the-counter medications), recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/ALT and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology. 8.4.2. Potential Cases of Decreased eGFR In the PF-06700841 FIH study B7931001, serum creatinine elevation was reported across dose levels in both healthy volunteer and psoriasis patients. The proposed mechanism for the observed serum creatinine increases in study B7931001 is inhibition of creatinine transport in the kidney (ie, transporter-mediated rather than direct nephrotoxicity). All subjects who are assigned to receive PF-06700841 in the Extension Period will have serum creatinine based and serum cystatin-C based eGFR calculated at EXD1 Visit upon entry into the study. Abnormal values in serum creatinine concurrent with absence of increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) that meet the below criteria, in the absence of other causes of kidney injury, are considered important medical events. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine (2009 CKD-EPI eGFR) {Levey, 2009 #25} and serum cystatin C (2012 CKD-EPI eGFR)14 will be determined at times specified in the Schedule of Activities. If an individual subject who is assigned to receive PF-06700841 in the Extension Period demonstrates a CONCOMITANT serum creatinine based AND serum cystatin C based eGFR decline of ≥30% compared to the subject’s baseline eGFR, then the subject should not be further dosed and adequate, immediate, supportive measures and immediate evaluation by nephrologist (preferably within 24 hours) with appropriate management should be taken for evaluation and treatment as clinically indicated. If the subject cannot be seen by a nephrologist within 24 hours, then the subject should be sent to a local emergency room for assessment of renal function. Results should be repeated as indicated by the nephrologist or weekly at a minimum until the eGFR returns to baseline ±15% or the renal parameters are deemed to be stable by the nephrologist and/or PI. eGFR results will be communicated to the treating physician. Subjects should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 24 to 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal eGFR (CONCOMITANT serum creatinine based AND serum cystatin C based eGFR decline of ≥30% compared to the subject’s baseline eGFR) result for a safety follow-up visit. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment. In addition to repeating serum creatinine and serum cystatin C, laboratory tests should also include: serum BUN, serum CK, serum electrolytes (including at a minimum potassium, sodium, phosphate/phosphorus, calcium), in addition to urine dipstick, urine microscopic examination, and urinary indices. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the above pre-set laboratory criteria, with no other cause(s) of laboratory abnormalities identified should be considered as important medical event irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal serum creatinine. All relevant test results will be forwarded to Pfizer for review within 30 days of receipt by the PI. This requirement applies to all subjects assigned to receive PF-06700841 in the Extension Period. 8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.4.3.1. Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if:  A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product.  An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).  A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy. If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safety using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs follows:  Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;  Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. A special safety concern (SSC), fetal cleft lip, was reported in the B7931004 (investigating PF-06700841 to treat psoriasis) trial affecting a singleton pregnancy of a subject on multiple concomitant medications including an herbal supplement which carried a pregnancy warning. 8.4.3.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.4.3.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. 8.4.4. Medication Errors Other exposures to the investigational product under study may occur in clinical trial settings, such as medication errors. 8.4.4.1. Medication Errors Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the investigational product by the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Medication errors include:  Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;  Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participating subject. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.      9.7. Interim Analysis during the Dose Ranging Period The statistical analysis plan and the interim analysis plan for this protocol may include an interim analysis using percent change from baseline in VASI score for all active treatments. Details regarding the analysis procedures to be used for the interim analysis will be provided in the interim analysis plan (IAP). The interim analysis may be performed when approximately 50% of subjects have completed or had the chance to complete the Week 24 visit. The objective of this interim analysis is to determine if there is evidence of lack of differentiation (“futility”) for the active treatments compared to placebo. The interim analysis will be based on a total of approximately 165 subjects who complete or had the chance to complete Week 24. 9.8. Data Monitoring Committee This study will use an internal review committee (IRC). The IRC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety of subjects in the study according to the charter. The IRC will review accumulating renal safety data and may propose changes to the protocol as needed to ensure subject safety. The IRC may also review results of any interim analyses as described in Section 9.6. The recommendations made by the IRC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to Pfizer management for final decision. Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. 9.9. Safety Adjudication Committees The identification of events requiring submission to an adjudication/review committee may be made by the study site and communicated to Pfizer or designee. Events requiring review, including opportunistic infections, cardiovascular, and malignancy events may also be identified by the Pfizer Study Team or designee during the review of subject data listings or by site monitors during routine monitoring of subject’s study records. The Pfizer Study Team or designee will notify the study site of any events should they identify. The Pfizer Study Team or designee will provide a listing of specific documents needed to support event adjudication by the Adjudication/Review Committees. Obtaining and submitting the documentation will be the responsibility of the study site. Event documentation will vary with the event requiring adjudication and may include (but not be limited to): hospital discharge summaries, operative reports, clinic notes, diagnostic tests, pathology reports, autopsy reports and death certificate information, as applicable. 10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study conduct to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This During study conduct and/or after study completion, the investigator site may be subject to review by the IRB/EC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. The investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the subject's medical records. The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 11.1. Report Forms/Data Collection Tools/Electronic Data Record As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study. A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The completed original CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The investigator shall ensure that the CRFs are securely stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access by unauthorized third parties. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry. In most cases the source documents are the hospital or the physician's chart. In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match those charts. In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator site and at Pfizer that clearly identifies those data that will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained by the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. The investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securely for so long as they are retained. If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met. 12. ETHICS 12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file. Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation. 12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki. 12.3. Subject Information and Consent All parties will comply with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of subject personal data. Such measures will include omitting subject names or other directly identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where required by applicable laws. The personal data will be stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to ensure that only authorized study staff have access. The study site will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of disaster. In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study site shall be responsible for determining whether a personal data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing breach notifications as required by law. To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, when study data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, subject names will be removed and will be replaced by a single, specific, numerical code, based on a numbering system defined by Pfizer. All other identifiable data transferred to Pfizer or other authorized parties will be identified by this single, subject-specific code. The investigator site will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the study, linking each subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity. In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of subjects’ personal data consistent with the Clinical Study Agreement and applicable privacy laws. The informed consent documents and any subject recruitment materials must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws. The informed consent documents used during the informed consent process and any subject recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by Pfizer, approved by the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection. The investigator must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study, the sharing of data relating to the study and possible risks associated with participation, including the risks associated with the processing of the subject’s personal data. The investigator further must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about his or her right to access and correct his or her personal data and to withdraw consent for the processing of his or her personal data. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject before any study-specific activity is performed, unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by an IRB/EC. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent document. 12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable regulatory authority in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any new information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures taken by the investigator to protect the study subjects against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of. 13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL 13.1. End of Trial in All Participating Countries End of trial in all participating countries is defined as last subject last visit (LSLV). 14. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB/EC, or investigational product safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 at any time. If a study is prematurely terminated, Pfizer will promptly notify the investigator. After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects and the hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within 7 business days. As directed by Pfizer, all study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible. 15. PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS 15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with applicable local laws/regulations. In all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and complete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in which the study was conducted. www.clinicaltrials.gov Pfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies (conducted in patients) that evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of a Pfizer product, regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted. US Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary completion date (PCD) for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the PCD for studies in pediatric populations. PCD is defined as the date that the final subject was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary outcome, whether the clinical study concluded according to the prespecified protocol or was terminated. EudraCT Pfizer posts European Union (EU) Basic Results on EudraCT for all Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies that are in scope of EU requirements. EU Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the PCD for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the PCD for studies in pediatric populations. www.pfizer.com Pfizer posts Public Disclosure Synopses (clinical study report synopses in which any data that could be used to identify individual patients has been removed) on www.pfizer.com for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies at the same time the US Basic Results document is posted to www.clinicaltrials.gov. 15.2. Publications by Investigators Pfizer supports the exercise of academic freedom and has no objection to publication by the principal investigator (PI) of the results of the study based on information collected or generated by the PI, whether or not the results are favorable to the Pfizer product. However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or unprotected inventions, the investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity to review any proposed publication or other type of disclosure of the results of the study (collectively, “publication”) before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed. The investigator will provide any publication to Pfizer at least 30 days before it is submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed. If any patent action is required to protect intellectual property rights, the investigator agrees to delay the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days. The investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for any study- or Pfizer product-related information necessary to the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study results. If the study is part of a multicenter study, the investigator agrees that the first publication is to be a joint publication covering all investigator sites, and that any subsequent publications by the PI will reference that primary publication. However, if a joint manuscript has not been submitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the study at all participating sites, the investigator is free to publish separately, subject to the other requirements of this section. For all publications relating to the study, the institution will comply with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II - “Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Publication of study results is also provided for in the CSA between Pfizer and the institution. In this section entitled Publications by Investigators, the defined terms shall have the meanings given to them in the CSA. If there is any conflict between the CSA and any attachments to it, the terms of the CSA control. If there is any conflict between this protocol and the CSA, this protocol will control as to any issue regarding treatment of study subjects, and the CSA will control as to all other issues. 16.

Study personnel should stay current and consult with their pharmacy to exclude all concomitant medications that are either moderate to potent CYP3A inhibitors or inducers or substrates, strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, substrate of MDR1, or substrate of OCT2/MATE. * Applicable to PF-06651600 and PF-06700841: All prohibited drugs that are CYP3A inhibitors or strong P-gp inhibitors (PF-06700841 only) require at least a 7 day or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to half-life averages ~58 days) prior to the first dose of IP. ** Applicable to PF-06651600 and PF-06700841: All prohibited drugs that are CYP3A inducers require at least a 28 day or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of IP. # Noted as potent inhibitors or inducers. ## Applicable to PF-06651600: For Germany only ### Applicable to PF-06700841 only. It is recommended that subjects avoid consumption of grapefruit juice exceeding 8 ounces (~240 ml) total in a day while in the study. In a situation where appropriate medical care of a subject requires the use of a prohibited CYP3A inhibitor or inducer: Moderate to potent inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A are not permitted in the study EXCEPT in emergency situations requiring no more than one day of administration. Note: Amiodarone and mitotane are not permitted for any duration due to their long half-lives. Topical (including skin or mucous membranes) application of antimicrobial and antifungal medications is permitted.   Appendix 4. Management of Dermatological Events Appendix 5. Guidelines for Subject Safety Monitoring and Discontinuation These guidelines for subject safety monitoring and discontinuation are to be applied to all subjects in study B7981019. Additional individual subject monitoring is at the discretion of the investigator and dependent on any perceived safety concerns. Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study to assess such concerns, and a subject may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator. Appendix 5.1. Monitoring All potential treatment-related reports of rash will be followed up until resolution or agreement with Pfizer. The following laboratory abnormalities require re-testing within 1 week (upon receving the laboratory results) until resolution or agreement with Pfizer:  Absolute neutrophil count <2000/mm3 (2.0 x109/L);  Hemoglobin <9.0 g/dL;  Platelet count below <100,000/mm3 (100 x109/L);  Lymphocytes <600/mm3; <0.6x109/L;  CK >3xULN (this also triggers urine myoglobin). Appendix 5.2. Discontinuation Treatment will be discontinued for: Subjects in Group 2 in Extension Period:  Subjects have <10% improvement in percent change in VASI at Extension Week 12 from baseline at Week 24. Adverse Events:  Serious infections, defined as any infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy or hospitalization;  Clinically meaningful, treatment related decline in hearing from baseline (refer to local guideline or equivalent);  Other serious or severe AEs, at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor. Potential Cases of Potential Drug-Related Rash:  Serious or severe drug-related rash at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor (Section 7.3.6.1.2). Potential Cases of Decreased eGFR: If an individual subject who is assigned to receive PF-06700841 in the Extension Period demonstrates a CONCOMITANT serum creatinine-based AND serum Cystatin C-based eGFR decline of ≥30% compared to the subject’s baseline eGFR, then the subject should not be further dosed and adequate, immediate, supportive measures and immediate evaluation by nephrologist (preferably within 24 hours) with appropriate management should be taken for evaluation and treatment as clinically indicated. If the subject cannot be seen by a nephrologist within 24 hours, then the subject should be sent to a local emergency room for assessment of renal function. Results should be repeated as indicated by the nephrologist or weekly at a minimum until the eGFR returns to baseline ±15% or the renal parameters are deemed to be stable by the nephrologist and/or PI (see protocol Section 8.4.2). Psychological Assessment At any post-baseline visits, if there are “yes” answers on items 4, 5 or on any behavioral question of the C-SSRS, the subject will be discontinued from the Dose Ranging Period or Extension Period and referred to a mental health professional for appropriate evaluation and treatment. If the subject cannot be seen by a mental health professional within 24 hours, then the subject should be sent to a local emergency room for psychiatric assessment. Vital Signs: The following vital sign abnormality will require discontinuation if it is confirmed. Confirmation through re-testing should occur within 1 week:  Diastolic: recurrent or persistent (≥24 hrs) or symptomatic increase from baseline, in same posture, by >20 mmHg. ECG: The following ECG abnormality will require discontinuation if it is confirmed by repeat ECG: QT prolongation defined as a QTc ≥500 msec or an absolute change in QTc ≥60 msec.  Appendix 6.

Alternative Measures During Public Emergencies The alternative study measures described in this section are to be followed during public emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic. This appendix applies for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic globally and will become effective for other public emergencies only upon written notification from Pfizer. Use of these alternative study measures are expected to cease upon the return of business as usual circumstances (including the lifting of any quarantines and travel bans/advisories). Eligibility Study B7981019 has been fully recruited and the eligibility criteria are not impacted by any public emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth Visits In the event that in-clinic study visits cannot be conducted, every effort should be made to follow up on the safety of study participants at scheduled visits per the Schedule of Activities or unscheduled visits. The participant site visits may be changed to telehealth visits (if permitted by law or local guidance) to reduce risk of potential participant exposure to COVID-19. Telehealth visits may be used to continue to assess participant safety and collect data points. Telehealth includes the exchange of healthcare information and services via telecommunication technologies (eg, audio, video, video-conferencing software) remotely, allowing the participant and the investigator to communicate on aspects of clinical care, including medical advice, reminders, education, and safety monitoring. The following assessments must be performed during a telehealth visit:  Review and record study intervention(s), including compliance and missed doses.  Review and record any AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to Section 8.  Review and record any new concomitant medications or changes in concomitant medications since the last contact.  Review and record contraceptive method and results of pregnancy testing. Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. Refer to Section 4.4.1 and Section 7.1 regarding pregnancy tests.  Evaluate VASI and facial-VASI (site assessment). Refer to Section 7.4.1, 7.4.2, and 7.4.3. A self-captured photos by the subject may aide in assessment of facial-VASI.  Complete PRO measures in the following order: VitiQoL, PGIC-V, and VNS. Refer to Section 7.6. Study participants must be reminded to promptly notify site staff about any change in their health status. Alternative Facilities for Safety Assessments Laboratory Testing If a study participant is unable to visit the site for protocol-specified safety laboratory evaluations, testing may be conducted at a local laboratory if permitted by local regulations. The local laboratory may be a standalone institution or within a hospital. The following safety laboratory evaluations may be performed at a local laboratory:  Clinical laboratory tests listed in Section 7.3.8.2, including hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis and other protocol specified tests.  Special safety assessment of serum creatinine and cystatin C, for estimation of eGFR. If a local laboratory is used, qualified study site personnel must order, receive, and review results. Site staff must collect the local laboratory reference ranges and certifications/accreditations for filing at the site. Laboratory test results are to be provided to the site staff as soon as possible. The local laboratory reports should be filed in the participant’s source documents/medical records. Relevant data from the local laboratory report should be recorded on the CRF. If a participant requiring pregnancy testing cannot visit a local laboratory for pregnancy testing, a home urine pregnancy testing kit with a sensitivity of at least 25 IU/mL may be used by the participant to perform the test at home, if compliant with local regulatory requirements. The pregnancy test outcome should be documented in the participant’s source documents/medical records and relevant data recorded on the CRF. Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. Imaging If the participant is unable to visit the study site for imaging assessment(s), the self captured photo APP (called “Pfizer Vitiligo Study B7981019” powered by Tissue Analytics) used by the subject may aide in assessment of facial-VASI. Qualified study site personnel must order, receive, and review results. Electrocardiograms If the participant is unable to visit the study site for single 12-lead ECGs, the participant may visit an alternative facility to have the ECGs performed. Qualified study site personnel must order, receive, and review results. Study Treatments If the safety of a trial participant is at risk because they cannot complete required evaluations or adhere to critical mitigation steps, then discontinuing that participant from study treatment must be considered. In situations where participants are quarantined or self-isolating, arrangements to send investigational product via courier may be implemented where allowable by law or by local guidance and with the participant’s verbal consent. Investigational product appropriate for the individual participant based on the study period and treatment group, may be shipped by courier to study participants if permitted by local regulations and in accordance with storage and transportation requirements for the investigational product. Pfizer does not permit the shipment of investigational product by mail. The tracking record of shipments and the chain of custody of investigational product must be kept in the participant’s source documents/medical records. Similar to investigational product dispensed at the clinical site, PF-06651600 tablets and matching placebo for oral administration will be in blisters and PF-06700841 tablets for oral administration will be in bottles. Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with the labels. Participants will take the medication orally once daily. Participants should swallow the tablets whole with 1 cup (240 mL or 2.4 DL) of ambient temperature water, without any manipulation or chewing. Participants will be encouraged to take the investigational product after breakfast whenever possible even though it may be taken with or without food. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events If a participant has COVID-19 during the study, this should be reported as an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE) and appropriate medical intervention provided. Temporary discontinuation of the study intervention may be medically appropriate until the participant has recovered from COVID-19. It is recommended that the investigator discuss temporary or permanent discontinuation of study intervention with the study medical monitor. Efficacy Assessments The efficacy assessments will be conducted to the best ability with available telehealth modality and calculate VASI and facial-VASI. If possible, obtain photographs of the target lesion with the best possible compliance with the Photography Instructions.
