The primary objective of this endpoint study is to evaluate the safety of tofacitinib at two doses versus a TNFi; the co-primary endpoints are adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and adjudicated malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers during study participation. The study will be declared complete when all of the following conditions are met:  At least 1500 subjects have been followed for 3 years.  The targeted number of MACE is observed.  The targeted number of malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, is observed. To achieve all of these conditions, it is expected that the study will include approximately 4000 subjects, recruited over 3 years and the total duration of the study will be approximately 5 years after the first subject is randomized. The Steering Committee will consider the ongoing accumulation of the adjudicated primary endpoint events and performance standard metrics and may determine that sufficient events have occurred to assess the primary objectives of the study or that it is not feasible to continue the trial in pursuit of these objectives. These determinations by the Steering Committee will be made in accordance with pre-specified rules documented in the Steering Committee Charter and in the Statistical Analysis Plan and following consultations with the US FDA, and could result in recommendations for changes to the study design, including changes in number of subjects studied or duration of study. Subject population Adult subjects who are 50 years of age or older, with moderately or severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate alone and who have certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease will be enrolled in this study. A minimum of approximately 4000 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Assessments The following assessments will be used to evaluate safety:  Changes in physical assessments, including weight and vital signs.  AE reporting, incidence and severity.  Incidence and severity of safety laboratory abnormalities.  Adherence to contraceptive use.  Adherence to protocol requirements.  Concomitant medication review.  Review of eligibility to continue study drug. The following assessments will be used to evaluate efficacy:  28 joint counts.  Patient Global Assessment.  Patient Assessment of Pain.  Physician Global Assessment.  C-reactive Protein (CRP).  A number of patient reported outcomes, including the Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Treatments All subjects will be enrolled on their previously prescribed dose of methotrexate and will be randomly assigned to one of three active treatment arms in the study:  Tofacitinib 5 mg BID.  Tofacitinib 10 mg BID.*  TNFi: adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection every other week in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada; etanercept 50 mg SC injection weekly in all other countries. * In response to new safety information about tofacitinib that was provided to Study A3921133 investigators on 19 February 2019, investigators were notified to verbally inform subjects randomized to tofacitinib 10 mg BID to reduce the dose of tofacitinib to 5 mg BID within 7 calendar days of this notification, secure their verbal agreement to continue in the study, and if they agreed, reduce their dose of tofacitinib to 5 mg BID for the remainder of the study. Tofacitinib is supplied as 5 mg tablets, which allowed subjects to decrease from their previous dose of 2 tablets twice daily to 1 tablet twice daily.

The study will be open-label and the randomization scheme for the study population (approximately 4000 subjects) will be in a ratio of 1:1:1 with approximately 1300 subjects randomized to tofacitinib 5 mg BID; approximately 1300 subjects randomized to tofacitinib 10 mg BID (subjects are switched to 5 mg BID per Amendment 8); and approximately 1300 subjects randomized to a TNFi. Safety Analysis The safety analysis will include all subjects in the study. The primary statistical safety objective is the estimation of the hazard ratios relative to the TNF inhibitor control for the two tofacitinib doses combined and for each dose of tofacitinib separately for the co-primary events of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers. Analyses of primary safety endpoints will be based upon adjudicated events. Both total time (ITT) and on treatment analyses of the main safety endpoints will be conducted. The on treatment analysis for MACE will censor subjects who cross over from tofacitinib or adalimumab to standard of care at 60 days after standard of care is initiated. The principal analysis for malignancies will not censor for subjects crossing to standard of care (ie, will be the total time analysis). Secondary safety endpoints will be summarized according to treatment received at the time of the event. For the purposes of statistical analyses, subjects who were randomized to tofacitinib 10 mg BID will be maintained in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID treatment arm after reducing the dose of tofacitinib to 5 mg BID.

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Indication Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) is a novel, oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor being investigated as a targeted immunomodulator and disease-modifying therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).1,7 1.2. Background and Rationale Tofacitinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of kinases with a high degree of selectivity against other kinases in the human genome.1 In kinase assays, tofacitinib, inhibits JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent tyrosine kinase 2 (TyK2). In cellular settings where JAK kinases signal in pairs, tofacitinib preferentially inhibits signaling by heterodimers containing JAK1 or JAK3 (JAK1/3) with functional selectivity over JAK2 homodimer signaling.2 Inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3 by tofacitinib blocks signaling through the common gamma chain containing receptors for several cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, and -21. These cytokines are integral to lymphocyte activation, development, homeostasis, proliferation, and function; therefore, inhibition of their signaling may result in modulation of multiple aspects of the immune response. In addition, inhibition of JAK1 will result in attenuation of signaling by additional pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and interferon (IFN)γ.3,4 At higher exposures, inhibition of erythropoietin, prolactin, and other hormones can occur via inhibition of JAK2 homodimer signaling. Tofacitinib is efficacious in rodent models of arthritis as assessed by clinical and histological measures of disease progression in the mouse collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) models. Tofacitinib is also efficacious in delayed type hypersensitivity models5 and rodent and primate transplant models.5, 6 Thus, tofacitinib shows promise in multiple models of autoimmunity and immune dysregulation. The broad immunosuppressive, immunomodulatory mechanisms of JAK3 inhibition is expected to block cytokine signaling which plays a key role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, and dampen innate and adaptive immune responses which plays a role in ulcerative colitis. The anti-inflammatory properties of JAK are expected to inhibit the effect of the infiltrating lymphocytes in the ocular surface and lacrimal gland. RA is a chronic and debilitating autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and destruction of the joints, substantial disability, and a significant impact on health status and quality of life; this results in a substantial economic burden to patients and society.8 In kinase assays, tofacitinib inhibits JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3, and to a lesser extent tyrosine kinase 2; in cellular settings, tofacitinib preferentially inhibits signaling by heterodimeric receptors associated with JAK3 and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity over JAK2-paired receptors. Inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3 by tofacitinib blocks signaling through the common gamma chain-containing receptors for several cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, and -21,7,9 which are integral to lymphocyte function, and inhibition of their signaling may thus result in modulation of multiple aspects of the immune response. In Phase 2b dose-ranging studies that evaluated a dose range of 1-15 mg twice daily (BID), tofacitinib demonstrated sustained efficacy and manageable safety over 24 weeks in patients with active RA when used as monotherapy10 or in combination with background etovfaalcuiatitnioibn ains Pmhoansoeth3e, rwaphyic1h2 oinr cilnu dcoedmab ibnraotaiodn r awnigthe MofT thXe1r3a,1p4eauntidc nsocnen-MarTioXs innovnebstiioglaotginicg disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).15 Phase 3 studies were initiated with two doses of tofacitinib, 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID, administered as monotherapy or concurrently on a background of non-biologic DMARDs. These studies demonstrated sustained efficacy and manageable safety up to 2 years in patients with active RA. Long-term extension studies have been ongoing since Phase 2 and have enrolled patients who participated in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; these open-label studies have demonstrated continued efficacy and a similar safety profile as seen in the controlled clinical trials. The preponderance of long-term data collected in these trials was obtained in patients on 5 mg BID of tofacitinib. This Post-Authorization Safety Study (PASS) was developed in response to the requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration to further define the safety profile of tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID, especially with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and malignancies, and to provide comparative safety analyses to a TNF inhibitor in an open-label manner. The subcutaneously self-administered TNFi’s, adalimumab and etanercept, will be included in this study. Subjects randomized to receive TNFi in the United States (US), Puerto Rico and Canada will receive adalimumab; in all other countries, subjects randomized to receive TNFi will receive etanercept. Based on the totality of the non-clinical and clinical data generated thus far, identified risks associated with tofacitinib include infection, lipid elevations, anemia, neutropenia and malignancies. The identified risks for the completed studies with tofacitinib in RA are presented in the XELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate) Investigator Brochure. New safety information about tofacitinib was provided to Study A3921133 investigators on 19 February 2019. That information stated that Pfizer received communication from the Tofacitinib Rheumatology Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) stating that on the basis of the data reviewed thus far in Study A3921133, there is a statistically and clinically important difference in the occurrence of pulmonary embolism within the tofacitinib 10 mg BID treatment arm compared to the TNFi control arm, and the overall incidence per person year in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID arm is substantially higher than the TNFi control arm and substantially higher than observed in other studies across the tofacitinib program. Additionally, the DSMB noted an increase in all-cause mortality in the 10 mg BID arm compared to the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and TNFi treatment arms. Based on the totality of evidence including a review of selected efficacy parameters and a finding of only minor increments in efficacy with tofacitinib 10 mg BID beyond the efficacy seen in the 5 mg BID group, the DSMB further stated that continued treatment with tofacitinib 10 mg BID in Study A3921133 entails a risk that is not sufficiently balanced. Tcohme pDaSriMsoBn stota TteNd Fthi ecyo natlrsool breemlieavine st haaptp trhoep rriiaskte-lbye nbeaflaitn pcreodf,i laen odf t htoafta tchieti nscibie 5n tmifigc BquIDes itnio n of evaluating the safety of tofacitinib 5 mg BID versus TNFi with respect to the co-primary and secondary safety endpoints in Study A3921133 is worthwhile and important. For this reason, the DSMB has recommended modifying Study A3921133 to discontinue treatment with tofacitinib 10 mg BID. They further recommended that patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and TNFi control treatment arms should continue to receive their assigned treatments. Pfizer has accepted this recommendation and with Amendment 8 is modifying the tofacitinib 10 mg BID treatment arm accordingly. Investigators were instructed to contact all subjects taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID within 7 calendar days and verbally inform them of this information, secure their verbal agreement to continue in the study and if they agreed, reduce their dose of tofacitinib to 5 mg BID. This amendment documents these changes and requires all subjects to sign the Addendum to the Informed Consent Document at their next study visit, explaining the safety information and secure their agreement to continue in the study. The comparator TNFi, adalimumab, is reported to be associated with risks of infection, malignancy, anaphylaxis or serious allergic reactions, demyelinating disease, cytopenias, pancytopenia, heart failure, and Lupus-like syndrome. The identified risks for adalimumab in RA are presented in the Humira (adalimumab) United States Package Insert (USPI), content revised January 2019. The comparator TNFi, etanercept, is reported to be associated with risks of infection, malignancy, demyelinating disease, lymphoma, congestive heart failure, pancytopenia or aplastic anemia, anaphylaxis or serious allergic reactions, Lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis. The identified risks for etanercept in RA are presented in the Enbrel (etanercept) EU SmPC, revised October 2017. Complete information for tofacitinib may be found in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD), which for this study is the XELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate) Investigator Brochure, Section 7.8 Undesirable Effects (All indications); the Single Reference Safety Document for the comparator agent, adalimumab, is the USPI, revised January 2019; the Single Reference Safety Document for etanercept is the EU SmPC, revised October 2017. 2.

Efficacy The following assessments will be used to evaluate efficacy in the study population:  28 joint counts.  Patient Global Assessment.  Patient Assessment of Pain.  Physician Global Assessment.  C-reactive Protein (CRP).  A number of patient reported outcomes, including the Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI). 2.2. Endpoints This study will use independent endpoint adjudication committees for the adjudication of events of interest (EoI), including the co-primary endpoints. For those events meeting the co-primary endpoint pre-defined criteria, the Steering Committee will be responsible for reviewing the aggregate accumulation of these events and for informing the Sponsor of recommendations made (eg, to continue the study or to stop the study). All other adjudicated events (eg, opportunistic infections, hepatic events, non-primary CV or malignancy events) will be reported in the usual fashion (See Section 8 Adverse Event Reporting). The investigator for the site of incidence will be notified of any malignancy or cardiovascular event reported as an EoI that is adjudicated by the Endpoint Adjudication Committee as NOT meeting endpoint criteria; the investigator at the study site must re-evaluate the EoI and report the event to Pfizer. SAEs must be reported in accordance with the timeframes described in the Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements section of this protocol (See 8.13). The investigator’s SAE awareness date in this instance is identified as the date that the corbiltiegraiati.o nHsa tnod rlienggu lSaAtoErys ianu tthhoisr imtieasn nuepro nw irlelc aelilpotw o fP sfiuzcehr StoA mEes.e t Aitns yS EpoonI stohra tr eapreo rptienngd ing adjudication at the annual safety report cutoff date will not be included in the safety tables of the annual report. 2.2.1. Safety Endpoints The safety endpoints will be collected and analyzed for all subjects in the study, through the end of the study. 2.2.1.1. Co-Primary Safety Endpoints The following co-primary safety endpoints will be analyzed to provide comparative rates for tofacitinib vs. the combined TNFi:  Malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers (adjudicated).  Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (adjudicated). The definitions of MACE used in this study are consistent with those outlined in the Standardized Definitions for Cardiovascular and Stroke End Point Events in Clinical Trials22 with the exclusion of cardiovascular death due to pulmonary embolism. The following events are included, as defined:  Cardiovascular death.  Death due to acute myocardial infarction (MI).  Sudden cardiac death.  Death due to heart failure.  Death due to stroke.  Death due to cardiovascular procedures.  Death due to cardiovascular hemorrhage.  Death due to other cardiovascular causes: peripheral artery disease.  Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI).  Non-fatal stroke of any classification, including reversible focal neurologic defects with imaging evidence of a new cerebral lesion consistent with ischemia or hemorrhage. 2.2.1.2. Secondary Safety Endpoints  Opportunistic infection events including tuberculosis (adjudicated).  Hepatic events (adjudicated).  Cardiovascular events other than MACE (adjudicated).  All adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs).  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory parameters.  All cause mortality (adjudicated).  Reasons for permanent or temporary discontinuation of study medication. 2.2.2. Efficacy Endpoints Efficacy endpoints will include:  Change from baseline to each post-baseline scheduled visit in DAS28-4 (CRP). Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI).  Rate of remission at each post-baseline scheduled visit including:  ACR-EULAR Boolean remission (defined as the subject satisfying all of the following: tender joint count ≤1, swollen joint count ≤1, C-reactive protein ≤1 mg/dL, patient global assessment ≤1 on a 0-10 scale).  SDAI ≤3.3.  CDAI ≤2.8.  Rate of low disease activity (LDA) at each post-baseline scheduled visit including:  SDAI ≤11.  CDAI ≤10.  DAS28-4(CRP) ≤3.2.  ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rate of at each post-baseline scheduled visit.  Change from baseline to each post-baseline scheduled visit in the HAQ-DI. 3. STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3b/4 randomized, parallel arm, open-label safety endpoint study. All subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms with approximately 1. Tofacitinib 5 mg BID (oral). 2. Tofacitinib 10 mg BID (oral).* 3. TNFi: In the US, Puerto Rico and Canada, subjects randomized to TNFi will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week (QOW) by subcutaneous injection (SC); in all other countries, subjects randomized to TNFi will receive etanercept 50 mg once weekly by SC injection. * In response to new safety information about tofacitinib that was provided to Study A3921133 investigators on 19 February 2019, investigators were notified to verbally inform subjects randomized to tofacitinib 10 mg BID to reduce the dose of tofacitinib to 5 mg BID within 7 calendar days of this notification, secure their verbal agreement to continue in the study, and if they agreed, reduce their dose of tofacitinib to 5 mg BID for the remainder of the study. Tofacitinib is supplied as 5 mg tablets, which allowed subjects to decrease from their previous dose of 2 tablets twice daily to 1 tablet twice daily. During the study, subjects may require alternate therapies in addition to, or instead of, their randomized drug assignment. All subjects, regardless of their treatment regimen will participate in the study until study completion. (See Sections 5.6.1 and 6.5). Study completion will be declared when all 3 of the following conditions are met: 1. At least 1500 subjects have been followed for at least 3 years. 2. The targeted number of MACE are observed (See Section 9.2.1). 3. The targeted number of malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers are observed (See Section 9.2.1). It is expected that approximately 4000 subjects will participate in the study and the expected duration of the study is approximately 5 years following randomization of the first subject. The exact number of subjects and duration of the study will be determined by the pre- specified rules outlined in the charter of the blinded Steering Committee. (See Section 9.6) The study design schematic for the study is represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Study Design (Minimum 1300 Per Arm, Total N=4000) Reduced to 5 mg BID per Amendment 8 4.

Randomization Criteria Subjects must complete all screening tests and procedures without evidence of exclusionary conditions and the investigator must attest to the suitability of the subject for inclusion in the study prior to randomizing the subject. Study treatments include orally administered tofacitinib and subcutaneously injected adalimumab in the US, Puerto Rico and Canada or subcutaneously injected etanercept in all other countries. 4.4. Life Style Guidelines 4.4.1. Non-Pharmacologic Interventions The subject may continue or initiate all non-pharmacologic therapies, such as physical therapy, as indicated and deemed appropriate for his/her physical condition. 4.4.2. Vaccine Guidelines It is recommended that subjects be up to date on all recommended vaccinations prior to enrollment in the study, including pneumococcal vaccine, herpes zoster vaccine, and flu vaccine. Vaccination with live components should not be given concurrently with study medication. In addition, current routine household contact with children and others who have been vaccinated with live vaccine components may pose a risk during treatment and for 6 weeks following completion of the study. Some of these vaccines include adenovirus Type 4 & Type 7, BCG, Dengue Fever, herpes zoster (“shingles”), measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, oral polio vaccine, rotavirus, Yellow Fever, and the intranasal flu vaccine. Subjects should avoid household contact with individuals receiving live or attenuated vaccinations; some examples include: varicella, attenuated typhoid fever, oral polio, attenuated rotavirus, FluMist® (inhaled flu vaccine). 4.4.3. Dietary Supplements For the purposes of this protocol, dietary supplements are defined as vitamins, minerals, purified food substances, and herbals with pharmaceutical properties. Vitamins, minerals and purified food substances are allowed in amounts not known to be associated with adverse effects (such as hypervitaminosis). Herbals with pharmaceutical properties are allowed only if there is acceptable evidence of no moderate or potent CYP3A inhibition or induction. Otherwise, herbals with pharmaceutical properties should not be given concurrently with study drug. 4.4.4. Surgery It is recommended that subjects who require major surgery temporarily discontinue study medication approximately 2 weeks prior to the surgical procedure, unless there are other safety concerns that require earlier discontinuation; if discontinued, study medication can be resumed following the surgical procedure when the sutures/staples are removed. If absorbing sutures or chemical closure methods are utilized, study medication can be resumed when the operative site is sufficiently healed and risk of infection is minimal. If a biopsy is performed during the course of the study, histopathology slides should be sent to the central laboratory for processing and over-read by the central pathology laboratory. Subjects should be treated based on the local pathology results. 4.4.5. Reproductive Status of Women Subjects and Partners of Male Subjects All male and female subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are biologically capable of having children and are sexually active, must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly for the duration of the active treatment period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product. The investigator, in consultation with the subject, will select the most appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject from the permitted list of contraception methods, and instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use. The investigator, at each study visit, will confirm and document consistent and correct use. In addition, the investigator will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected (for Canada, please refer to Appendix 6 for specific contraception requirements). Highly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and include: 1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception are allowed provided the subject remains on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness. 2. Correctly placed copper containing intrauterine device (IUD). 3. Male condom or female condom used WITH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, suppository). 4. Male sterilization with appropriately confirmed absence of sperm in the post- vasectomy ejaculate. 5. Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy. 4.5. Sponsor Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the trial is documented in the study contact list located in the coordinator’s manual. To facilitate access to appropriately-qualified medical personnel on study related medical questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, subject study number, contact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subject’s participation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the established communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The help desk number is not intended for use by the subject directly and if a subject calls that number they will be directed back to the investigational site. 4.6. Rater Qualifications This study will use a Joint Count Assessor to assess the number of swollen and tender/painful joints, as part of the assessment of RA activity. The Joint Count Assessor should be a health care provider who has been trained in rheumatology and specializes in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or has experience in conducting at least 20 joint count assessments in clinical trials or has been trained by a health care professional and conducted over 20 supervised joint count assessments. 5. STUDY TREATMENTS Study treatments include tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID (10 mg BID reduced to 5 mg BID with Amendment 8), administered orally, as the citrate salt tablet formulation or TNFi (adalimumab 40 mg administered every other week in solution for subcutaneous injection in the US, Puerto Rico and Canada or etanercept 50 mg administered weekly in solution for subcutaneous injection in all other countries). Subjects will be randomized to one of the three treatment arms. 5.1. Allocation to Treatment Subjects will be allocated to receive open-label drug supplies in accordance with the randomization schedule. Randomization will be accomplished using IVRS (an automated web/telephone randomization system provided by the sponsor). The IVRS contains the randomization schedule. At the Screening Visit, the investigative site will contact the IVRS (online or by telephone call). The site will enroll the subject into the IVRS by indicating minimal information sufficient to distinguish one subject from another (eg, date of birth and initials) and receive the Subject Identification (ID) number. At the Baseline Visit, the system will apsrsoovcidiaet eth teh arta nsudbojmeciztawtiiothn tnhuem nbeexrt. available treatment on the randomization schedule and The system will then give the investigative site a code which corresponds to study medication that is to be dispensed. This code corresponds to study medication of that treatment group to which the subject has just been randomized. The site will call the system on visits when study medication is to be dispensed. The randomization schedule allows for overage; enrollment will be controlled by the IVRS and when a sufficient number of subjects have enrolled, the randomization part of the system will be stopped. The part of the system that supplies codes will continue until the last subject randomized has been dispensed the last supply of study medication. All subjects will be provided open-label study medication through the end of the study. All study medication will be dispensed as appropriate for self-administration by study subjects. With Amendment 8, those subjects previously randomized to tofacitinib 10 mg BID will only receive 1 bottle of 5 mg tablets instead of 2 bottles at each visit. 5.2. Breaking the Blind All drug supplies will be open-label supplies and labeled appropriately to include drug substance, dose, and dosing instructions. There will be no need to “break the blind” as drug will not be blinded. 5.3. Drug Supplies 5.3.1. Formulation and Packaging Each bottle of tofacitinib and prefilled syringe of either adalimumab or etanercept will be labeled appropriately as per the regulatory label requirement. Refer to investigational product manual for details on clinical packaging. 5.3.1.1. Open-Label Study Medication 5.3.1.1.1. Tofacitinib Supplies Tofacitinib will be provided as 5 mg tablets for oral administration by the Sponsor. Tablets will be supplied in bottles as appropriate for the dosing regimen. 5.3.1.1.2. Comparator Study Medication: Adalimumab Supplies The comparator adalimumab will be provided as 40 mg prefilled syringes for injection in cartons by Sponsor or sourced locally by the study sites. 5.3.1.1.3. Comparator Study Medication: Etanercept Supplies The comparator etanercept will be provided as 50 mg prefilled syringes for injection in cartons by the Sponsor. 5.3.2. Preparation and Dispensing All study/comparator medication will be dispensed in bottles and as prefilled syringes. At each dispensing visit, subjects will receive a sufficient quantity of study medication to last until their next scheduled drug dispensing visit plus an additional amount to accommodate visits scheduled within the allowed visit range. Subjects will also receive written dosing instructions. 5.3.3. Administration All subjects must continue using their personal supply of methotrexate. The pre-study stable dose of methotrexate will be continued in all subjects throughout the study, unless modification is clinically indicated. Subjects will be trained prior to receiving their study medication supplies in the proper techniques for study medication administration, including proper self-injection, if required. Subjects will be provided with medication instructions relevant to their study treatment arm. Study medication will be taken according to the instructions provided to the subject. The amount of trial medication dispensed at each visit must be recorded. At each drug dispensing study visit the subject must return the trial medication containers and any unused medication and unused syringes for accountability and the amount of drug returned will be recorded to account for all dispensed trial medication. Dosage of adalimumab used in this study (subcutaneous injections of 40 mg every other week) is as approved in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) for adalimumab in patients with RA, as identified in Section 1 of this protocol. Dosage of etanercept used in this study (subcutaneous injections of 50 mg every week) is as approved in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) for etanercept in patients with RA, as identified in Section 1 of this protocol. 5.3.4. Medication Errors Medication errors may result, in this study, from the administration or consumption of the wrong drug, by the wrong subject, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the adverse event (AE) page of the case report forms (CRFs) and on the SAE form when appropriate. In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately. Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, including:  Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;  Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participating subject. Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the cfuarptthuerre dd eotani lasn) .adverse event (AE) CRF page (refer to Adverse Event Reporting section for All overdoses are medication errors. For the purpose of this study, medication errors will be reported as protocol deviations if the subject reported taking 2-fold or more of their prescribed dose for one or more days or were identified as consuming more than 120% of their prescribed dose over the visit interval. The following sections provide examples of overdosage for each study medication. 5.3.4.1. Tofacitinib Overdosage There is no experience with overdose of tofacitinib. Pharmacokinetic data up to and including a single dose of 100 mg in healthy volunteers indicate that more than 95% of the administered dose is expected to be eliminated within 24 hours. There is no specific antidote for overdose with tofacitinib. In case of an overdose, it is recommended that the subject be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions. Subjects who develop adverse reactions should receive appropriate treatment. Overdoses of tofacitinib are defined by doses and duration of dosing not administered in the tofacitinib development program. The following doses and duration of dosing have been administered in tofacitinib clinical trials without evidence of dose-limiting symptoms and are not considered overdoses:  ≤100 mg tofacitinib daily for up to 2 weeks.  ≤60 mg tofacitinib daily for up to 6 weeks.  ≤30 mg tofacitinib daily for up to 6 months. Please note, that concomitant treatment with a prohibited potent CYP3A inhibitor (Appendix 2) is assumed to result in a doubling of exposure. Thus, the doses noted above should be reduced by one half for each of the time intervals if the subject is taking a prohibited potent CYP3A inhibitor. For further details, please refer to the XELJANZ (tofacitinib) Investigator Brochure. 5.3.4.2. Adalimumab Overdosage Doses up to 10 mg/kg have been administered to subjects in clinical trials without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. In case of overdosage, it is recommended that the subject be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately as described in the locally approved labeling for adalimumab. 5.3.4.3. Etanercept Overdosage Toxicology studies have been performed in monkeys at doses up to 30 times the human dose with no evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. No dose-limiting toxicities have been observed tdwuricineg t hceli nreiccaolm trmiaelns doefd e dtaonseer)c hepavt.e Sbienegnl ea dinmtrianvisetneoreuds tdoo hseesa luthpy t ov o6l0u nmtege/mrs i(napanp roximately endotoxemia study without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. 5.3.5. Compliance Compliance with expected consumption of dispensed medication will be assessed by determining the expected number of doses to be taken during any given time period and comparing that to the number of doses returned, keeping in mind that subjects may have their study drug temporarily withheld due to abnormal laboratory tests, adverse events, or the need to take a short course of a prohibited concomitant medication. Doses not taken during these events do not constitute protocol deviations and should not be considered dosing errors, but should be noted in the dosing log with the reason for reduced drug consumption. Subjects, who are less than 80% compliant with the orally administered dosage regimen or have not used 2 or more injectable syringes expected to be used in the interval, will be counseled and the site will implement appropriate measures to secure subject compliance, including instituting interim visits to evaluate and encourage compliance, as appropriate to the site and reason for non-compliance. When compliance of less than 70% of the expected number of doses for any one of the orally administered study medications or the subject has not used 3 or more injectable syringes that were expected to be used in the interval is suspected, the reason for non-compliance (more than or less than expected consumption) with the dosing regimen should be documented in the dosing log of the subject’s case report form, and should be reported as a protocol deviation and unless there is a protocol stipulated reason for non-compliance with the dosing regimen, this should be recorded as a dosing error. When compliance of more than 120% of the expected number of doses for the orally administered dosage regimen or have used 2 or more injectable syringes than was expected to be used in the interval, the reason for non-compliance (more than expected consumption) with the dosing regimen should be documented in the dosing log of the subject’s case report form with the reason for non-compliance, reported as a protocol deviation, and recorded as a dosing error. 5.4. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability The investigational drug product should be stored in accordance with the drug label. Storage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure (IB) for tofacitinib, United States Package Insert (USPI) for adalimumab, EU SmPC for etanercept, or Local Product Document (LPD)) will be superseded by the drug label storage requirements. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor. Once a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.

At the end of the clinical trial, all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the patients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent, or destroyed in an approved manner unless otherwise authorized by Pfizer. In either case, the forms must identify the investigational product, including batch or code numbers, and account for its disposition on a subject by subject basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be signed by the individual who dispensed the drug. 5.5. Concomitant Medication(s) All concomitant medication taken during the study must be recorded with generic name of the medication, reason for administration, dose and frequency, route of administration and start and stop dates in the subject’s case report form. A subject who is receiving an allowed concomitant medication for any reason should be on a locally approved medication and a dose that is considered standard of care for the treated indication. 5.5.1. Allowed Concomitant Medications Please note that all concomitant DMARDs are excluded at entry into the study, except methotrexate and antimalarial DMARDs (ie, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine). During the study, if a subject is not adequately treated with their assigned study treatment, non-biologic DMARDs (ie, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide) may be added to their treatment regimen; methotrexate dosage may be modified if clinically indicated (see Section 5.6). 5.5.1.1. Methotrexate All subjects entering the study must have taken MTX continuously for at least 4 months prior to the Screening visit and have been taking a stable, weekly dose of MTX for at least 6 weeks prior to the Baseline visit and continue taking that dose throughout the study, unless modification is clinically indicated. MTX doses less than 15 mg/week are allowed only in the presence of documented intolerance to or toxicity from higher doses. Doses higher than 25 mg/week are not permitted under any circumstances. 5.5.1.2. Folate Supplementation Subjects must receive either folic acid (at least 5 mg weekly) or folinic acid (at least 2.5 mg weekly) as folate supplementation according to local MTX label guidelines and standard of care. 5.5.1.3. Treatment for Latent Tuberculosis Subjects who are diagnosed as having latent tuberculosis (ie, positive tuberculosis test, chest x-ray negative for active tuberculosis, and no evidence of active disease) at Screening or during the course of the study must have either been previously treated with an adequate course of treatment or be currently taking isoniazid. Subjects that the investigator considers taor ebaes )a mt haiyg hb-er isstka rttoe dd eovne ilsoopn tiuabzeidrc tureloastmis e(netg ,a tr ethsied idnigsc irne thioignh o-rfi sthke a irnevaes sotirg tartaovre. l Wto hheing h-risk indicated, isoniazid treatment is required to be administered orally at 300 mg/day for a total of 9 months of treatment and the treatment must be recorded in the subject’s case report form. If an alternate treatment regimen is implemented, the reason for this must be documented and a copy of the local standard of care guideline identifying such treatment must be provided to the study team. Within approximately one month of initiating treatment with isoniazid, the subject should have transaminase levels checked. PLEASE NOTE: although commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis, rifampin, rifampicin, rifabutin and rifapentene are prohibited concomitant medications in this study. 5.5.1.4. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Other Analgesics Subjects may continue taking stable daily doses of NSAIDs. Subjects, who require intermittent therapy for symptom relief, may use short-acting analgesics including NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, and opioids. Topical NSAIDs are allowed at any time during the study. 5.5.1.5. Corticosteroid Use Daily dosages of oral corticosteroids should remain at doses 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Reductions in oral corticosteroid dose are allowed as needed to protect a subject’s safety. Intra-articular corticosteroids, intramuscular corticosteroids (eg, DepoMedrol) and short- term oral corticosteroid use (eg, Medrol Pak) will be allowed during the study. 5.5.2. Disallowed Concomitant Medications All prohibited concomitant medications should be discontinued at least 4 weeks or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the Baseline visit; specific medications and required discontinuation times are listed below. A list of prohibited concomitant medications is provided in Appendix 2. Any investigational treatment must be discontinued prior to the Baseline visit for 4 weeks or 5 half lives, whichever is longer. 5.5.2.1. Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) 5.5.2.1.1. Methotrexate All subjects should be maintained on their stable dose of MTX, unless modification of dose is clinically indicated. 5.5.2.1.2. Other DMARDs Subjects who have received biologic or non-biologic DMARDs are eligible to participate in the study, providing the following discontinuation periods are observed prior to the first dose Table 1. DMARDs - Required Washout Period Prior to Randomization Visit 52 weeks Rituximab (subject must have normal CD 19/20+ counts by FACS analysis) 20 weeks Gold compounds, including auranofin (Ridaura),and injectable gold (aurothioglucose or aurothiomalate) 12 weeks Abatacept, certolizumab pegol, leflunomide*, tocilizumab 10 weeks Golimumab 8 weeks Infliximab 6 weeks Adalimumab 4 weeks Anakinra, azathioprine, cyclosporine, etanercept, minocycline, penicillamine, sulfasalazine, tacrolimus * Alternately, leflunomide may be discontinued 4 weeks prior to Randomization Visit when discontinued using an elimination procedure (ie, 8 grams cholestyramine 3 times daily for at least 24 hours or 50 grams activated charcoal 4 times daily for at least 24 hours), as described in the leflunomide package labeling to significantly lower leflunomide drug levels. 5.5.2.2. Immune-Modulating Biologic Products While receiving study drug, no immune-modulating biologic products are allowed to be administered concomitantly, including other biologic DMARDs (Appendix 2). 5.5.2.3. CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors and CYP3A4 Inducers Tofacitinib exposure is increased when co-administered with medications that are potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) and medications that result in both moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and potent inhibition of CYP2C19 (eg, fluconazole). Tofacitinib exposure is decreased when co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inducers (eg, rifampin). During treatment with adalimumab, the formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (eg, TNFα, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for a molecule that antagonizes cytokine activity, such as adalimumab, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of adalimumab in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (eg, warfarin) or drug concentration (eg, cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed. To ensure sufficient washout of these effects on safety and efficacy endpoints, drugs that are potent CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors and drugs that are potent CYP3A4 inducers must be discontinued for at least 7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the Baseline visit. Only systemically administered drugs listed in Appendix 2 require discontinuation; other routes of administration (eg, topical, vaginal, ophthalmic) are not prohibited. If a medication that is a potent CYP3A inhibitor or is both a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 and potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 is administered during the study for any reason, including the treatment of an adverse event, all study medication should be interrupted during treatment.

Immunizations Live or live-attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with study medication. If immunization with a live or live-attenuated vaccine is required during the study, study drug should be temporarily discontinued prior to vaccination. 5.6. Rescue Therapy All subjects enrolled in this study should remain on their randomized, assigned treatment for the length of the study. However, it is understood that some subjects may need adjustments to their therapy during the study. If adjustment in RA therapy is being considered, it is recommended that the first modification to a subject’s therapy be the addition or optimization of treatment with short-acting analgesics, corticosteroids and methotrexate. 5.6.1. Changes in Assigned Drug The investigator should consider the need for adjustment in treatment for the individual subject based on 1) disease duration, 2) disease activity, and 3) current medication regimen. It is recommended that subjects who have Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) >10 and have not had at least a 10 point decrease in CDAI compared to Baseline at Month 3 may be considered for modification of treatment. Subjects who in the investigator’s opinion require treatment should be treated appropriately. Changes in the randomized dose of study drug (ie, tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, adalimumab 40 mg every other week, etanercept 50 mg weekly) are not allowed prior to Amendment 8, at which time subjects in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID treatment arm had their dose of tofacitinib decreased to 5 mg BID. If modification of analgesic, corticosteroid or methotrexate is not sufficient, consider adding a nonbiologic DMARD (eg, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide) in addition to the study treatment. It is recommended that if modifications are made to the subject’s treatment regimen, the investigator should wait 3-6 months before further modifications are made. If such modifications do not provide adequate treatment, and it is in the subject’s best interest to discontinue study assigned treatment (tofacitinib or adalimumab or etanercept), standard of care therapy should be initiated. It should be noted that standard of care treatment will not be provided by the study. It is important to note that investigators will be required to document all treatments, time on treatment regimens and the rationale for decisions in escalating or changing therapies. Subjects on alternate therapies will remain in the study and continue to be followed, performing all study procedures according to the protocol until the end of the study. 6. STUDY PROCEDURES 6.1. Screening Visit The study investigator or a sub-investigator will discuss, with each subject, the nature of the study, its requirements, and its restrictions. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to performance of any protocol specific procedures. Subjects must complete the screening procedures and have test results available prior to the Baseline visit to confirm that they meet the entrance criteria for the study. All screening procedures must be completed within a 1 month window, unless otherwise noted. Subjects, who are on prohibited medications and are deriving a beneficial response from them, should not be entered into this study. However, there may be subjects taking a prohibited medication who have experienced an ineffectual/suboptimal response or side effects and wish to enter the study. These subjects may require a washout period that extends beyond the screening duration (See Section 5.5 Concomitant Medication(s)). Additionally, screening procedures may need to be repeated to provide valid data (eg, laboratory testing) and turnaround time may extend beyond the screening duration. For these subjects, written informed consent and a Study Subject Identification (SSID) number must be obtained prior to initiation of the washout period. In no instance should the screening window exceed 3 months. Subjects who do not have all tests completed within the 1 month screening period or who temporarily do not meet study entry criteria (eg, treatment with antibiotics during the screening period or for administrative reasons) may re-screen one time; the subject’s prior SSID number and reason for re-screening must be documented. Subjects should be fasting for at least 6 hours prior to laboratory testing. No subject who is disqualified by laboratory testing will be permitted to re-screen (ie, positive hepatitis or HIV screen, positive QuantiFERON Gold®TM In-Tube Test without adequate treatment, confirmed hemoglobin<9 g/dL, confirmed transaminases >1.5 x ULN). Subjects who do not meet screening criteria and/or do not re-screen, must be discontinued and the reason for screen-failure must be documented in the CRF. Procedures to be performed during the screening period include:  Informed Consent.  Confirmation of RA diagnosis and Classification of RA: subject must have a score of 6 or greater on the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (Appendix 1).  Medical History: include previous vaccination history, smoking status, average weekly alcohol consumption, family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD), and history of any prior episodes of herpes zoster.  Complete Physical Examination: height, weight, vital signs, general appearance, skin (presence of rash), HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), lungs (auscultation), heart (auscultation for presence of murmurs, gallops, rubs), lower extremities (peripheral edema), abdominal (palpation and auscultation), neurologic (mental status, station, gait, reflexes, motor and sensory function, coordination) and lymph nodes.  Fasting laboratory testing (Blood Chemistry, Hematology, CRP, HIV Serology, HBsAg, HBcAb, HBsAb, HCV Ab, HCV RNA, Rheumatoid Factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP), Urinalysis, Lipid Profile): All required laboratory testing must be complete and reported; any invalid specimens must be retested and reported prior to the Baseline visit.  Pregnancy testing must be completed for all women of child-bearing potential: all subjects must test negative; confirmation and documentation of the use of a highly effective method of contraception by sexually active subjects of child-bearing potential must be done (for Canada, please refer to Appendix 6 for specific contraception requirements).  QuantiFERON Gold®TM In-Tube Test: unless the subject has previously received an adequate course of therapy for either latent or active TB infection (Section 5.5.1.3 Treatment for Latent Tuberculosis).  Chest x-ray must show no evidence of active tuberculosis or other finding that would exclude the subject from the study (see Section 7.3 Chest Radiograph).  12-lead electrocardiogram.  RA Activity: 28 tender/painful and swollen joint counts performed and the number of swollen joints and the number of tender/painful joints meet the criteria for inclusion.  History of Prior and Concomitant Medications: this includes start dates and stop dates with reason for discontinuation (if appropriate), dosage and frequency of administration, and indication treated (make sure all indications are listed in the medical history) for all current medications, any medications taken within the 4 weeks prior to screening procedures, and a complete history of all DMARDs ever taken including the dates of administration and the reasons for discontinuation. 6.2. Study Period It is expected that a minimum of approximately 4000 subjects will be enrolled in the study and the study will continue until at least 1500 subjects complete 3 years in the study and the estimated number of malignancy events and MACE are observed. Screening to enroll a total of approximately 4000 subjects is expected to be completed in approximately 3 years and the endpoints achieved in approximately 5 years from first subject randomized. Thus, each subject’s individual participation will vary, depending on when the subject is randomized into the study.

All attempts to contact the subject and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the subject’s medical record. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the subject to return all unused investigational product(s), request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs). 6.2.1. Visit Windows The screening period is expected to be no longer than 4 weeks in duration, unless exceptions noted in Section 6.1 are documented, with the Baseline visit (Day 1) occurring within the 28 days following the day that the subject signs the informed consent. All other visits (Visits 2-22) should be conducted as close to the scheduled visit day as possible. Exceptions may be made to accommodate holidays and unexpected events, such as weather-related site closures or illnesses requiring hospitalization. In these cases, the visit should be scheduled or re-scheduled as close to the original visit schedule as possible. All visits will contribute to the dataset. The visit window for Visit 2 (Month 2) is 2 weeks; all other visit windows are 1.5 months to ensure capture of all data. Partial visits (ie, those that do not include all required procedures) must be noted clearly and the reason documented in the subject’s case report form. 6.3. Visit 1, Baseline Visit (Day 1) Subjects are required to fast for at least 6 hours prior to the visit.

Subject Withdrawal It is important to continue all subjects in the study and perform all tests and procedures until the study is completed to enable collection of safety data, even if a subject withdraws from the study assigned treatment, unless the subject withdraws their consent to continue Swuitbhjdercatsw mn aayt awniyth tdimraew a ft rtohme dthisec rsetutidoyn aotf atnhye tiinmvees atitg tahteoirr oorw snp orenqsuoer sfto, ro sra tfheetyy omra bye bhea vioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site. If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the subject and document their current status. All attempts to contact the subject and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the subject’s medical record. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the subject to return all unused investigational product(s), request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs). If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, this should be documented and no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 7. ASSESSMENTS Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are completed as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well being of the subject. When a protocol required test cannot be performed the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion. 7.1. Physical Examination A standard physical examination will be performed at the Screening visit. The following parameters and body systems will be examined and any abnormalities described: height, weight, general appearance, skin (presence of rash), HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat), lungs (auscultation), heart (auscultation for presence of murmurs, gallops, rubs), lower extremities (peripheral edema), abdominal (palpation and auscultation), neurologic (mental status, station, gait, reflexes, motor and sensory function, coordination) and lymph nodes. 7.2. Assessment of New Physical Findings and Safety Assessments At all visits after the Screening visit, an abbreviated physical examination will be performed assessing the following: weight, vital signs, lungs, heart, lower extremities for peripheral edema, abdomen and lymph nodes. Any clinically significant changes from the last complete physical examination should be recorded as adverse events (AEs); ongoing AEs should be updated, as appropriate. 7.3. Chest Radiograph A chest radiograph will be obtained at the Screening Visit in all subjects, unless it has been taken and documented within the 3 months prior to the Screening visit. To be considered eligible for the study, the radiograph must be negative for active tuberculosis infection. During the course of this study, annual screening for latent and/or active TB will be conducted using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test. All subjects with positive results must have a chest radiograph performed and the radiograph must be negative for active tuberculosis infection. Subjects identified as having latent TB should be treated appropriately (Section 5.5.1.3 Treatment for Latent Tuberculosis). Chest computed tomography (CT) scans will not be performed as part of the study procedures. However, if a chest CT scan has been performed for other reasons within the 3 months prior to a scheduled chest radiograph; subjects do not have to perform a chest radiograph, but rather, the results of the chest CT scan may be used to confirm the absence of active tuberculosis infection. 7.4. Electrocardiogram A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained on all subjects at the Screening visit and at the End of Study visit. All ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly for at least 10 minutes. ECGs will be read locally. All ECG results will be documented in the CRF and copies of the tracings maintained in the subject’s source documentation. Subjects with a screening 12-lead electrocardiogram that demonstrates clinically significant abnormalities requiring urgent treatment (eg, acute myocardial infarction, serious tachy- or bradyarrhythmias) or that is indicative of serious underlying heart disease (eg, cardiomyopathy, major congenital heart disease, low voltage in all leads) should not be enrolled in the study. End of Study ECGs will be compared to the Screening ECG and any clinically significant changes will be recorded as adverse events, submitted for adjudication and evaluated further, as clinically warranted. 7.5. Assessments of Disease Activity Individual components for the following indicators of disease activity will be collected throughout the study as described in Table 2. Table 2. Disease Activity Indicators Indicator Definition/Calculation DAS28-4 (CRP) DAS28-CRP(4) = 0.56*√(TJC28) + 0.28*√(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*PtGA + 0.96 Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) (28TJC) + (28SJC) + PhyGA + PtGA + CRP Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (28TJC) + (28SJC) + MDGA + PtGA American College of Rheumatology (ACR) The ACR’s definition for calculating a 20% improvement in Response Rates RA (ACR20) is as follows: a 20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts and 20% improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR-core set measures: patient and physician global assessments, pain, disability, and an acute-phase reactant (eg, CRP). Similarly, ACR50, 70 and 90 are calculated with the respective percent improvements. ACR/EULAR Boolean-based definition of At any time point, a subject must satisfy all of the following: remission tender joint count 1, swollen joint count 1, CRP 1 mg/dL, patient’s global assessment of health 1 on a 0-10 scale TJC = tender joint count; SJC = swollen joint count; CRP = C-reactive protein in mg/L; PtGA = patient’s global assessment of health; PhyGA = physician’s global assessment of health 7.6. Joint Counts 7.6.1. Tender/Painful Joint Count (28 Joint Count) Twenty-eight (28) joints will be assessed by a joint assessor to determine the number of joints that are considered tender or painful. The response to pressure/motion on each joint will be assessed using the following scale: Present/Absent/Not Done/Not Applicable (to be used for artificial joints). The 28 joints to be assessed are the shoulders, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP), proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP), and knees. Artificial joints will not be assessed. 7.6.2. Swollen Joint Count (28 Joint Count) The joint assessor will also assess these joints for swelling using the following scale:  Present/Absent/Not Done/Not Applicable (to be used for artificial joints). The 28 swollen joint count includes the following joints: shoulders, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP), proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP), and knees. Artificial joints will not be assessed. 7.7. Patient Assessment of Arthritis Pain Subjects will assess the severity of their arthritis pain using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) placing a mark on the scale between 0 (no pain) and 100 (most severe pain), which corresponds to the magnitude of their pain. 7.8. Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis Subjects will answer the following question, “Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, how are you feeling today?” The subject’s response will be recorded using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). 7.9. Physician Global Assessment of Arthritis The investigator will assess how the subject’s overall arthritis appears at the time of the visit. This is an evaluation based on the subject’s disease signs, functional capacity and physical examination, and should be independent of the Patient’s Global Assessment of Arthritis. The investigator’s response will be recorded using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). 7.9.1. Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI) The HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a subject has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities.17 Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing “no difficulty,” 1 as “some difficulty,” 2 as “much difficulty,” and 3 as “unable to do”. Any activity that requires assistance from another individual or requires the use of an assistive device adjusts to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status. The form should then be checked by the site staff for completeness. 7.9.2. SF-36 Health Survey (Version 2, Acute) The SF-36 v.2 (Acute)18 is a 36-item generic health status measure. It measures 8 general health domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. These domains can also be summarized as physical and mental component scores. The form should be checked for completeness by the site staff. 7.9.3. EuroQol EQ-5D Health State Profile (Health-related Quality of Life) The EuroQol EQ-5D Health State Profile is a copyrighted, subject completed instrument designed to assess impact on health-related quality of life in five domains: mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Additionally, scores from the five domains may be used to calculate a single index value, also known as a utility score. The validity and reliability of the EuroQol EQ-5D has been established in a number of disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis.19 The form should then be checked by site staff for completeness. 7.9.4. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire The Work Productivity & Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI): Rheumatoid Arthritis is a 6-item questionnaire that is specific for rheumatoid arthritis and yields four types of scores: absenteeism, presenteesism (impairment at work/reduced job effectiveness), work productivity loss and activity impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity. 7.9.5. C-reactive Protein (CRP) The CRP will be collected at each visit and analyzed by a central laboratory. It will be used in the calculation of several efficacy parameters. CRP test results will not be blinded and will be provided to the investigator for all visits. 7.10. Clinical Laboratory Tests Blood and urine samples will be collected at the time points identified in Table 3. Unscheduled clinical laboratory tests may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns. For Czech Republic, Spain and United Kingdom, see Appendix 5 for additional testing required. Table 3.

If Antibody (HBsAb) HBsAb is negative, the subject will be excluded from the study (see Section 4.2) Table 3. Clinical Laboratory Tests Tests Visits Comments Hepatitis C virus antibody Screening Visit Subjects with positive HCV Ab tests will be (HCV Ab) reflex tested for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic Hepatitis C RNA (HCV acid (HCV RNA).

Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing must be conducted on all female subjects of childbearing potential, regardless of whether or not they are sexually active at least at every scheduled visit of the study. Serum pregnancy testing will be performed by the central laboratory for all visits. For female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test, with sensitivity of  25 mIU/mL, will be performed at screening, before investigational product administration at the baseline visit, and at the end of treatment visit. A negative pregnancy result is required before the subject may receive the investigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever one menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected), repeated at every study visits and at the end of the study to confirm the subject has not become pregnant during the study. In the case of a positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test, the subject will be withdrawn from study medication but may remain in the study. Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request of an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or if required by local regulations. 7.12. Pregnancies Occurring During Study If an unplanned pregnancy occurs in a female subject or the partner of a male subject while the man or woman is enrolled in this study, regardless of therapy at the time of pregnancy, the pregnancy will be followed to termination and outcome will be documented. In addition, for those pregnancies occurring in the United States, the pregnancy will be followed through an existing Pfizer-sponsored pregnancy registry (ie, Tofacitinib Pregnancy Exposure Registry OTIS Autoimmune Diseases in Pregnancy Project, A3921203). The registry will collect exposure and outcome information for those pregnancies and all live born infants followed in this registry will be examined by one of a team of study-dedicated dysmorphologists within the first year of life. 7.13. Banked Biospecimens 7.13.1. Markers of Drug Response Variation in genetic markers and other biomarkers may help to explain some of the variability in response seen with some drugs among different individuals. This is referred to as pharmacogenomic/biomarker research. Comparing the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), RNA, protein, and metabolite variation patterns of subjects who respond well and those who respond poorly to treatment may help to better define the most appropriate group of patients in which to target a given treatment. Collecting biospecimens for exploratory pharmacogenomic/biomarker analyses and retaining them in the Pfizer BioBank makes it possible to better understand the drug’s mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, efficacy, tolerability, or safety not anticipated prior to the beginning of the study. Providing these biospecimens is a required study activity for study sites and subjects, unless prohibited as such by local regulations or ethics committee decision.

Data will be stored on password-protected computer systems. The key between the code and the subject’s personal identifiers will be held at the study site; the researchers using the biospecimens and data generated from them will not have access to the key nor any personally identifying information. Biospecimens will only be used for the purposes described here and in the informed consent document/patient information sheet; any other uses require additional ethical approval. Unless a time limitation is required by local regulations or ethical requirements, biospecimens will be stored indefinitely to allow for future research on the topics described here, including research conducted during the lengthy drug development process and also post-marketing research. Subjects can withdraw their consent for the use of their biospecimens at any time by making a request to the investigator, in which event any remaining biospecimen will be destroyed; data already generated from the biospecimens will continue to be stored to protect the integrity of existing analyses. It is very unlikely that results generated from the biospecimens will have any clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic implications for the individual study participants. Subjects are notified in the informed consent document/patient information sheet that their results will not be given to them, unless required by local laws or regulations, in which case results will be returned via the investigator. Results will not be provided to family members or other physicians; nor will they be recorded in the subject’s medical record. There is no intention to contact subjects after completion of the clinical trial. A 4 mL blood biospecimen, Prep D1 (K EDTA whole blood collection optimized for 2 DNA analysis), will be collected at the Visit 1, Visit 6, and the End of Study Visit to be retained for potential pharmacogenomic/biomarker analyses related to drug response, unless prohibited by local regulations or ethics committee decision. For example, putative safety biomarkers, drug metabolizing enzyme genes, drug transport protein genes, or genes thought to be related to the mechanism of drug action may be examined. Additional biospecimens to be retained for exploratory analyses in this study include:  Prep B1 (K2 EDTA plasma collection optimized for biomarker/proteomic/metabonomic analysis): a 10 mL blood biospecimen will be collected at the Visit 1, Visit 6 and the End of Study Visit.  Prep B2 (serum collection optimized for biomarker/ proteomics/metabonomic analysis): a 10 mL blood biospecimen will be collected at the Visit 1, Visit 6 and the End of Study Visit. The Banked Biospecimens will be collected from all subjects unless prohibited by local regulations or ethics committee decision. Detailed collection, processing, storage and shipment instructions are provided in the central laboratory manual. It is possible that the use of these biospecimens may result in commercially viable products. Subjects will be advised in the informed consent document/patient information sheet that they will not be compensated in this event. 7.13.2. Additional Research Unless prohibited by local regulations, subjects will be asked to indicate on the consent form whether they will allow the Banked Biospecimens to also be used for the following research:  Investigations of the disease under study in the clinical trial, and related conditions;  Biospecimens may be used as controls. This includes use in case-control studies of diseases for which Pfizer is researching drug therapies; use in characterizing the natural variation amongst people in genes, RNA, proteins, and metabolites; and use in developing new technologies related to Pharmacogenomics/biomarkers. Subjects need not provide additional biospecimens for the uses described in this section; the biospecimen specified in Markers of Drug Response Section will be used. Subjects may still participate in the clinical trial if they elect not to allow their Banked Biospecimens to be used for the additional purposes described in this section. 7.14. Suicidality Assessment There are no current medically significant suicidality concerns for any of the study drugs (ie, tofacitinib, adalimumab or etanercept) in this study or their respective mechanisms of action. Ongoing and aggregate cumulative safety reviews and pharmacovigilance activities will be conducted; if any concerns are identified that would warrant changes to these assessments, surveillance tools will be implemented, as appropriate. 7.15. Triggered Requirements for Monitoring For additional Czech Republic, Spain and United Kingdom-specific laboratory criteria, see Appendix 5. cells/mm3  ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; g/dL = grams per deciliter; GGT = gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase, PT/INR = Prothrombin Time International Normalized Ratio; mm = millimeter; x ULN = times the upper limit of normal 8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 8.1. Adverse Events All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following sections. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated representative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator to determine the causality of the AE. The investigator is required to assess causality. Follow-up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event that is determined by the Sponsor to be serious will be reported by the Sponsor as an SAE. To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical trial. 8.2. Reporting Period For SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from the time that the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a subject after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug are AtaEkesn( saetr lieoausst aonnde ndoonse-s oerfi sotuusd)y s htroeualtdm bene tr tehcroorudgehd loans tt hsueb CjeRcFt vfirsoimt. the time the subject has 8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  Abnormal test findings;  Clinically significant symptoms and signs;  Changes in physical examination findings;  Hypersensitivity;  Progression/worsening of underlying disease;  Drug abuse;  Drug dependency. Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:  Drug overdose;  Drug withdrawal;  Drug misuse;  Drug interactions;  Extravasation;  Exposure during pregnancy;  Exposure via breastfeeding;  Medication error;  Occupational exposure. 8.4. Infections All treated infections occurring during the study, including, but not limited to, respiratory infections, cutaneous infections, urinary tract infections and episodes of suspicious or febrile diarrhea, should be cultured and any identified organisms noted in the CRF. A(selle pSoetecntitoianl 9o.p7p.2orOtupnpiostritcu ninisfteicct iIonnfesc wtioilnl bRee avdiejuwd iCcaotmedm bityte aen). external review committee Infections should be classified as either serious infections or treated infections, as defined below. 8.4.1. Treated Infections A treated infection is any infection that requires antimicrobial therapy by any route of administration or any surgical intervention (eg, incision and drainage). Subjects who experience infections that require treatment can have their study drug temporarily discontinued during antimicrobial therapy. This information should be noted in the CRF. 8.4.2. Serious Infections A serious infection is any treated infection that requires hospitalization for treatment or requires parenteral antimicrobial therapy or meets other criteria that require it to be classified as a serious adverse event. A subject who experiences a serious infection should have study drug interrupted until the subject recovers. Appropriate laboratory investigations, including but not limited to cultures should be performed to establish the etiology of any serious infection. All adverse events, including serious adverse events, should be reported as described in Section 8 on Adverse Event Reporting. All serious infections will be reviewed by the Opportunistic Infection Review Committee to determine whether they are potential opportunistic infections (Section 9.7.2). 8.5. Abnormal Test Findings The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows:  Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or  Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or  Test result leads to a change in study dosing (eg, temporary discontinuation of study drug) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or  Test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or sponsor. Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 8.6. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  Results in death;  Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions);  Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Lack of efficacy should be reported as an AE when it is associated with an SAE. Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject, or if the event may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.6.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events All lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders, regardless of causality must be reported as SAEs and as potential safety endpoints. For all other potential safety endpoint events, unless the investigator believes that there is a causal relationship between study drug and an event specified below, these events should not be reported by the investigator as SAEs as described in Section 8.13.1. These events are anticipated to occur in a population with rheumatoid arthritis. However, these events should still be captured as adverse events in the potential safety endpoint case report form. Protocol-specified events that will not be reported in an expedited manner: 1. Malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers. 2. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The definitions of MACE used in this study include the following events:  Cardiovascular death.  Sudden cardiac death.  Death due to heart failure.  Death due to stroke.  Death due to cardiovascular procedures.  Death due to cardiovascular hemorrhage.  Death due to other cardiovascular causes: peripheral artery disease.  Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI).  Non-fatal stroke of any classification, including reversible focal neurologic defects with imaging evidence of a new cerebral lesion consistent with ischemia or hemorrhage. Should the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) determine that these pre-specified events occur more frequently in a drug treatment group, these events will be submitted and reported in accordance with Pfizer’s safety reporting requirements as described in Section 2.2. Except for the co-primary endpoints identified above, all EoIs, including EoIs that require adjudication (eg, hepatic events, NMSC, non-cardiovascular deaths, opportunistic infections) will be reported as described in Section 8.13. EoIs that are adjudicated as not meeting the pre-specified endpoint criteria will be returned to the investigator for re-evaluation and submission as an AE or SAE, as appropriate. For all EoIs returned to the investigator, the awareness date of the event becomes the date the EoI is received back from adjudication. 8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury Abnormal values in aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered important medical events. Reported transaminase elevations from both AEs and laboratory reports will be reviewed by the study team to identify any potential cases of drug-induced liver injury that occur during the course of the study; all potential cases of drug-induced liver injury will be adjudicated by an external review committee, which may request additional data surrounding the event to assist in the classification of such events (see Section 9.7.1 Hepatic Event Review Committee). The investigator should refer to the following guidance when evaluating subjects with transaminase elevations. Tdehpee tnhdrse sohno ltdh eo sf ulbabjeocrta’tso irnyd aivbindouraml ablaitsieelsi nfeo rv aa lpuoetse anntida lu cnadseer loyfi ndgru cgo-ninddituiocends. liSvuerb jiencjutsr yw ho present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:  Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST or ALT 3 times the upper limit of normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin 2 X ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase 2 X ULN or not available;  For subjects with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the upper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned above:  For subjects with pre-existing AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 2 times the baseline values and 3 X ULN, or 8 X ULN (whichever is smaller). Concurrent with  For subjects with pre-existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: Total bilirubin increased by one time the upper limit of normal or ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (whichever is smaller). The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history and physical assessment. In addition to repeating AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/INR, and alkaline phosphatase. A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced subject, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs. Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs and study drug should be interrupted at least until the event is resolved. All potential cases of drug-induced liver injury will be reviewed by the Hepatic Event Review Committee (Section 9.7.1). 8.7. Hospitalization AEs reported from studies associated with hospitalization or prolongations of hospitalization are considered serious. Any initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a healthcare facility meets these criteria. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). Hospitalization does not include the following:  Rehabilitation facilities;  Hospice facilities;  Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);  Skilled nursing facilities;  Nursing homes;  Routine emergency room admissions;  Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include:  Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for work-up of persistent pre-treatment lab abnormality);  Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);  Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical exam);  Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg, for a procedure required by the study protocol);  Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective cosmetic surgery);  Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;  Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.

For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 8.8. Severity Assessment Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above. 8.9. Causality Assessment The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non- serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if applicable. An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor (see Section on Reporting Requirements). If the investigator's causality assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", this should be clearly documented on study records. In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. 8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy For investigational products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in-utero (EIU) occurs if: 1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or being exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure) or after discontinuing or having been directly exposed to the investigational product; 2. A male has been exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy. If a study subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this information to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report and Exposure During Pregnancy (EDP) Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EDP Supplemental Form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:  Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;  Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as serious adverse events when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to investigational product.

In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the study subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigator must document on the EDP Supplemental Form that the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also Section on Subject Withdrawal) Please note: Subjects should not be withdrawn from the study due to adverse events. However, the assigned study drug may be withdrawn and is considered a withdrawal from the assigned treatment group. Withdrawal as described in this section refers to withdrawal from the assigned treatment group, as subjects should continue in the study until the study is completed. Withdrawal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response, according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page. Insufficient response to study medication should only be reported as an AE only when associated with an SAE (See Section 8.6 Serious Adverse Events). When a subject withdraws due to an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below. 8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about AEs. 8.13. Reporting Requirements Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate. 8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements If an SAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event. If an SAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of the site’s notification that an SAE has been deemed a non-endpoint and has been sent back to the site. The investigator’s SAE awareness date in this instance is identified as the date that the investigator receives the non-endpoint SAE back from the endpoint adjudication committee. As noted in the Endpoints section, when the investigator has judged the SAE to have a causal relationship with the investigational product, the investigator must report the event to the sponsor within 24 hours of investigator awareness, even if that event is a component of the endpoint. Iimn mpaerdtiicautelalyr,, iifr rtehsep SecAtiEvei so ffa tthael oerx ltiefnet- tohfr eaavtaeinlainbgle, nAoEtifiincfaotrimona ttioo nP.f i zTehri sm tuimste bfera mmaed ael so applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of exposure during pregnancy and exposure via breastfeeding cases. In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (eg, if an outpatient study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the AE. For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an investigator may be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an expedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on the AE CRF. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must be provided. In the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its designated representative. 8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF. Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information. 8.13.3. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. 9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan, which will be maintained by the Sponsor. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 9.1. Sample Size Determination The statistical objectives with respect to the primary safety endpoints, that is, malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), and MACE, include drawing inferences with 95% (two-sided) confidence that the hazard ratios of the combined tofacitinib regimens versus the TNFi control regimen are less than 1.8. Assuming that the true hazard ratio is 1.0 the required number of events is 138 for malignancies to achieve 90% power and 103 for MACE to achieve 80% power. The planned enrollment is approximately 4000 patients within 3 years (1000 in the first year and 1500 per year in the second and third years of recruitment). The assumed ‘dropout or Loss to Follow-up’ (LTFU) rate for MACE is 10% in the first year, 7% in the second and 5% per year, thereafter. For malignancies, because they will be followed after discontinuation the LTFU rate is assumed to be 5% in the first year, 3.5% in the second year and 2.5% per year thereafter. The assumed event rate for MACE is 1.0 event per hundred patient-years and the assumed rate for malignancy is 1.1 events per hundred patient-years; assumptions are based on results from the CORRONA database,20 and also based on a meta-analysis of TNF-  inhibitors.21 Based on those assumptions it is expected that the trial will accrue the desired number of events in approximately 5 years. Additionally, the statistical objectives with respect to the primary safety endpoints include drawing inferences with 95% (two-sided) confidence that the hazard ratios of the tofacitinib 10 mg regimen to the tofacitinib 5 mg regimen are less than 2.0. Assuming that the true hazard ratio is 1.0 the required number of events is 87 for malignancies to achieve 90% power and 65 for MACE to achieve 80% power. Based on the same assumptions of patient enrollment, LTFU and event rates, the trial is expected to accrue the desired number of events in approximately 5 years. The trial will conclude when the required number of events (138 malignancies and 103 MACE) has been observed. It is likely that more than the required events may be observed in one endpoint in order to get the required event in another, therefore the power may be higher for a given endpoint (eg, more than 103 MACE events may need to be observed in order to observe 138 malignancy events). The final analysis will utilize all observed events. Software for sample size and power calculation was East 5®, Cytel Inc, Boston, MA, USA. 9.2. Safety Analysis 9.2.1. Analysis of Primary Safety Endpoint The co-primary safety endpoints of malignancies and MACE will be analyzed to provide comparative rates for tofacitinib vs. the combined TNFi. The primary statistical safety objective is the estimation of the hazard ratios relative to the TNFi control for the two tofacitinib doses combined and for each dose of tofacitinib separately for the adjudicated events of MACE and malignancy excluding non-melanoma Hpraimzaarrdy reantidopso fionrt .t hTe hsea freattyio esv feonrt sb ootfh m toafianc iintitneirbe sdt owseilsl cboem cablicnuelda tveedr ssuesp athraet ecloynftroorl e, afochr each tofacitinib dose versus the control, and for the two tofacitinib doses versus each other will be reported along with their 95% confidence intervals. Adjustments for multiplicity will not be applied. The primary statistical method for deriving estimators for hazard ratios will be the fitting of proportional hazards (Cox) regression models. A model containing only the single independent variable for treatment group will be calculated and reported. The effects of adding other predictors to the model, such as geographic region, age, gender, and so forth will be fully explored and reported. An analysis by TNFi subset strata (ie, the sites/regions where either adalimumab or etanercept was used) will be conducted to assure consistency of results. A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) analysis of the malignancy endpoint will be conducted. Both total time (or ITT) and on treatment analyses of the main safety endpoints will be conducted. The total time analysis will not censor times to event and will ascribe events to randomized treatment. The on-treatment analysis for MACE will censor subjects who crossover from tofacitinib, adalimumab or etanercept to standard of care at 60 days after standard of care is initiated. The principal analysis for malignancies will not censor for subjects crossing to standard of care (ie, will be the total time analysis). 9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints The secondary safety endpoints will include an evaluation of the following events:  Opportunistic infection events including tuberculosis (adjudicated).  Hepatic events (adjudicated).  Cardiovascular events other than MACE (adjudicated).  All AEs, including SAEs.  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory parameters.  All cause mortality (adjudicated).  Reasons for permanent or temporary discontinuation of study medication. Adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities (Section 2.2.1.2) will be summarized according to treatment received at the time of the event. Both ITT and on treatment analyses will be conducted for the other secondary endpoints listed in Section 2.2.1.2. 9.3. Efficacy Analysis Efficacy endpoints will include:  Change from baseline to each post-baseline scheduled visit in DAS28-4 (CRP). Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI).  Rate of remission at each post-baseline scheduled visit including:  ACR-EULAR Boolean remission (defined as the subject satisfying all of the following: tender joint count ≤1, swollen joint count ≤1, CRP ≤1 mg/dL, patient global assessment ≤1 on a 0-10 scale).  SDAI ≤3.3.  CDAI ≤2.8.  Rate of low disease activity (LDA) at each post-baseline scheduled visit including:  SDAI ≤11.  CDAI ≤10.  DAS28-4(CRP) ≤3.2.  ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rate of at each post-baseline scheduled visit.  Change from baseline to each post-baseline scheduled visit in the HAQ-DI. Descriptive statistics of efficacy endpoints for all subjects in the study will be provided from baseline to the declared end of the study. Differences between each tofacitinib regimen and the TNFi regimen, as well as between tofacitinib regimens, will be estimated. Details may be found in the statistical analysis plan. 9.4. Interim Analysis No interim analysis of the study data will be performed for use outside the DMC and the Steering Committee. 9.5. Data Monitoring Committee This study will use an external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of safety of subjects in the study in an unblinded manner according to the Charter. All safety data, including potential primary endpoint data will be forwarded to, and reviewed by, the DMC on a regular basis. Based on these reviews, the DMC will have the capacity to make recommendations to Pfizer that might cdoencidsuiocnt .o fP tfhizee srt uwdiyll wfoirllw baer df osruwchar ddeecdi stoio Pnfsi,z werhaicnhd mthaey S itnecelruidneg sCuommmmairtiteese ofof ra gfignraelg ate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data which are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. 9.6. Steering Committee The Steering Committee is a committee established by Pfizer to oversee the conduct of the trial, assess at intervals the progress of a clinical trial (ie, Performance Standards), the aggregate accumulation of primary endpoint events (ie, MACE and malignancies) meeting pre-specified criteria, and the attainment of 1500 subjects completing 3 years in the study. The Steering Committee will recommend to the study team whether to continue, modify or stop a trial, independently from the study team. The Steering Committee will include only non-Pfizer trial experts who are not members of the study team. The Steering Committee will consider the ongoing accumulation of the adjudicated primary endpoint events and study performance standard metrics and may determine that sufficient events have occurred to assess the primary objectives of the study or that it is not feasible to continue the trial in pursuit of the stated objectives. These determinations by the Steering Committee will be made in accordance with pre-specified rules documented in the Steering Committee Charter and in the Statistical Analysis Plan and following consultations with the US FDA could result in recommendations for changes in study design, including changes in number of subjects studied or duration of study. The Steering Committee Charter will pre-specify all reviews of the data that will be performed during the conduct of the study and how the data will be evaluated to determine that study completion can be declared. The Steering Committee will be responsible for blinded review of adjudicated, aggregate primary endpoint data according to its charter. Any recommendations made by the Steering Committee to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to the study team who will confer with the US FDA prior to implementation of any changes in the study design. Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data which are not endpoints to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. The numbers of events necessary to achieve the targeted statistical power for the comparisons of the hazards for the primary endpoints with respect to the various combinations of treatment groups and boundaries were given in a previous section of this protocol. Additionally, the Steering Committee will maintain detailed Performance Standards (refer to Section 13), periodically review metrics and implement corrective actions, as needed. 9.7. External Adjudication/Review Committees The external, independent adjudication (or review) committees that are planned for use in this study are described below. All review committees will make a detailed assessment and follow-up of events to determine if the event meets pre-defined criteria. To assist in this process, sites may be asked to submit additional data to facilitate that assessment. The review and classification processes for each are defined in detail in the respective charters. 9.7.1. Hepatic Event Review Committee The Hepatic Event Review Committee (HERC) will review, assess and categorize potential events of hepatic injury reported in this study. Case review and assessment by the HERC will be independent of Pfizer. Events will be identified for adjudication by study investigators, Pfizer personnel (or designee) and/or by search of the clinical, safety and laboratory databases. Each reviewed event will be assessed as to whether the event represents drug-associated drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Each case reviewed will be classified for the following categories:  Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI).  Pattern of Injury.  Hy’s Law Case.  Severity of injury.  Recovery.  Liver Failure.  Likely, competing or alternative cause(s). The product of the HERC will be narrative in format. The process of adjudication will be defined in the Hepatic Event Review Committee’s charter. 9.7.2. Opportunistic Infection Review Committee The Opportunistic Infection Review Committee (OIRC) will review, assess and categorize potential opportunistic infections (OI) reported in this study. Case review and assessment by the OIRC will be independent of Pfizer. Events will be identified for adjudication by study investigators, Pfizer personnel (or designee) and/or by search of the clinical and safety databases. Each potential OI will be assessed as to whether it meets specific criteria:  Opportunistic Infection (type specified).  Does not meet criteria.  Unevaluable or Undetermined. The process of adjudication will be defined in the Opportunistic Infection Review Committee’s charter. Both the reported and adjudicated event terms will be reported in the study database; analyses will be based on adjudicated events. 9.7.3. Cardiovascular Safety Endpoint Adjudication Committee The Cardiovascular Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CV-EAC) will evaluate and adjudicate selected CV safety events by a consistent set of criteria. Case review and assessment by the CV-EAC will be independent of Pfizer. Events will be identified for adjudication by study investigators, Pfizer personnel (or designee) and/or by search of the clinical and safety databases. Cardiovascular events to be adjudicated include:  Death (coronary and non-coronary).  Myocardial Infarction.  All Coronary Revascularization.  Unstable Angina.  New Ischemic Heart Disease.  Stroke (fatal and non-fatal).  Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA).  Congestive Heart Failure (CHF).  Peripheral Arterial Vascular Disease (PAVD) – first diagnosis or procedure.  Deep Vein Thrombosis  Pulmonary Embolism  Arterial Embolism  Arterial Thrombosis The process of adjudication will be defined in the Cardiovascular Endpoint Adjudication Banoatlhy sthees wreipllo brteedb aasnedd aodnj uaddijcuadteicda teevde netv etenrtms.s will be reported in the study database; 9.7.4. Malignancy Adjudication Committee and Histopathology Over-read The Malignancy Adjudication Committee (MAC) will review, assess and categorize potential malignancies reported in this study. Case review and assessment by the MAC will be independent of Pfizer. Events will be identified for adjudication by study investigators, Pfizer personnel (or designee) and/or by search of the clinical and safety databases. Each potential event will be assessed as to whether 1) it meets criteria for classification as a malignancy and 2) the type of malignancy. Additionally, any biopsy that is performed to evaluate the potential presence of a malignant process will be reviewed independently by blinded, board-certified pathologists at a central laboratory. This includes any biopsy performed to evaluate a potential malignancy in which the local pathology evaluation is consistent with either a benign process, a “pre-malignant process” or dysplasia, and includes cases of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Pathology review will also include procedures performed for other reasons (ie, cosmetic surgery or removal of ischemic tissue) in which a malignancy is identified by the local pathology evaluation. Histopathology review will not encompass routine screening procedures for dysplasia such as a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear but will encompass cervical biopsy procedures as follow-up for abnormal Pap smear findings. The MAC will review case information including patient history, diagnostic tests such as imaging, local biopsy results, central pathologist’s diagnosis, surgical outcomes and other medical records as appropriate and available. The local pathologist’s diagnosis and the central pathologist’s diagnosis, as well as both the reported and adjudicated event terms will be reported in the study database. 9.8. Additional Safety Event Review Committees Additional safety event review committees may be established for review of specific events, such as interstitial lung disease and gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, to enhance the specificity and accuracy of reporting for these events. These safety event review committees may be internal or external and will be independent of the study teams. The review process will be defined in the respective committee charters. As for external review committees, sites may be asked to submit additional data to facilitate that assessment. 10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE During study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. The study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study. A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The completed original CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry. In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's records or the physician's subject chart. In these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be retained by the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met. 12. ETHICS 12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File. Copies of IRB/IEC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation. 12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 and 2008). In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH guideline on GCP, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. 12.3. Subject Information and Consent All parties will comply with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of participant data. Participants’ personal data will be stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to ensure that only authorized study staff have access. The study site will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of disaster. In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study site shall be responsible for determining whether a personal data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing breach notifications as required by law. To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, participants will be assigned a single, participant-specific numerical code. Any participant records or data sets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the numerical code; participant names will not be transferred. All other identifiable data transferred to the sponsor will be identified by this single, participant-specific code. The study site will maintain a confidential list of participants who participated in the study, linking each participant’s numerical code to his or her actual identity. In case of data transfer, the sponsor will protect the confidentiality of participants’ personal data consistent with the clinical study agreement and applicable privacy laws. The informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements. The informed consent document(s) used during the informed consent process must be reviewed by the sponsor, approved by the IRB/IEC before use, and available for inspection. The investigator must ensure that each study subject, or his/her legal representative, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject or the subject's legal representative before any study-specific activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent document. 12.4. Subject Recruitment Advertisements approved by ethics committees and investigator databases may be used as recruitment procedures. 12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable Competent Authority in any area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any new information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS During the study, the following performance standards will be monitored and evaluated. Metrics will be reported to the Steering Committee and additional measures may be taken by the Steering Committee to ensure the study integrity and timely completion of the study. The Steering Committee will maintain a Performance Standard Document with a complete description of the performance standards applied to this study, acceptable targets and remedial steps to be taken if not satisfactorily met. An overview of the performance standards is presented here. 13.1. Enrollment Rate Performance Standard The purpose of this performance standard is to identify an acceptable rate of enrollment that allows subjects to be enrolled in the study at a rate sufficient to provide acceptable data to allow interpretation of the study endpoints within the requirements of this protocol. An acceptable target rate of enrollment provides guidance to the operational study team in determining the country footprint of the study and ultimately the selection of sites. During the first 12 months of the study, sites will be in various stages of start-up; the recruitment rate is expected to gradually increase relative to the number of sites actively recruiting and then remain stable through the recruitment period. The sample size and recruitment period may vary dependent upon the Steering Committee’s recommendations to the study team. A minimum of approximately 4000 subjects randomized over approximately a 3-year recruitment period with at least 1500 subjects completing approximately 3 years in the study is expected and the target number of events for MACE and malignancies has been achieved. The target rate of enrollment for this study is to randomize all subjects by the end of the recruitment period. Recruitment rates are followed monthly by study, region and investigator site. This study is being managed by an Alliance Partner. The Alliance Partner will have risk/mitigation plans in place to identify specific remedial actions to be taken, depending on the reason for variance from the expected recruitment rate; these actions will be implemented as appropriate (Clinical Trial Process Quality Standard (CTPQS)-106 Plan and Manage Study Execution, Version 3, Effective Date: 15-Feb-2013). If recruitment falls below 100 subjects per month for 3 consecutive months and all sites planned have been initiated, the study team will identify the issues impacting recruitment and implement appropriate strategies if feasible, which may include increasing the number of sites participating in the study, providing recruitment tools to sites, which may include the development of site-specific advertisements and brochures, and/or retraining of sites to increase enrollment. 13.2. Target Population Performance Standard The purpose of this performance standard is to identify the acceptable target population to be recruited into this study. The acceptable population is defined as subjects 50 years of age or older with active rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular risk factors that meet all inclusion criteria for the study as defined in Section 4.1 Inclusion Criteria and that do not have evidence of any exclusion criteria as defined in Section 4.2 Exclusion Criteria. The performance standard for this study is that all subjects enrolled in the study meet the definition for inclusion. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are monitored as subjects are enrolled in the study. Subjects are noted as protocol deviations if they do not meet the criteria for inclusion in the study (see Section 13.4 Subject Ineligibility Performance Standard). If a subject who is identified as not meeting the criteria is randomized to study drug, appropriate steps will be taken by the study team, including immediate withdrawal of the subject, if warranted to protect the safety of the subject. Subjects who were not completely eligible for inclusion in the study for reasons that impact the analysis of the study endpoints will be excluded from the Per Protocol Analysis Set, but included in the Full Analysis Set. This study is being managed by an Alliance Partner. The Alliance Partner will have risk/mitigation plans in place to identify specific remedial actions to be taken, depending on the reason for deviation for including subjects that do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria; these actions will be implemented as appropriate (CTPQS-106 Plan and Manage Study Execution, Version 3, Effective Date: 15-Feb-2013). 13.3. Primary Endpoint Safety Event Rate Performance Standard The purpose of this performance standard is to prospectively identify the presumed rate at which the primary endpoint safety events occur during the study to inform decisions regarding enrollment or length of the study. There are two co-primary endpoints in this study; major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and malignancies. The performance standard for this study is the rate of MACE, which is 1.0 event per hundred patient-years, and the assumed rate for malignancy, which is 1.1 events per hundred patient- years. Rates of events will be calculated for the blinded treatment groups for use by the Steering Committee periodically and will guide the Steering Committee in making recommendations regarding the sample size or length of study needed to evaluate the comparative endpoints. Rates significantly higher than expected may result in recommendation for a smaller study, ldoensgigenr swtuildl ybeo rm daisdceo onntilnyu faotliloonw oinf gth ceo sntsuudlyta ftoiorn isn fweaitshi bthileit yU. S A FlDl mAo.difications to the study 13.4. Subject Ineligibility Performance Standard The purpose of this performance standard is to identify the standard by which deviations from the protocol are identified that may render subjects ineligible for continued inclusion in the study or in statistical analyses of the study. Protocol deviation identification and documentation will be accomplished for this study according to the Sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) that require periodic review of individual protocol deviations and periodic review of aggregated cumulative protocol deviations. Prior to initiation of the study, a list of potentially important protocol deviations (pIPDs) is developed in alignment with the requirements of the protocol. This list is updated, as necessary, to include other deviations identified during the course of the study. Monitors identify and log all protocol deviations during the course of the study at each participating site. Additionally, pIPDs are prospectively identified; pIPDs are used by the statistician and clinician in determining eligibility for inclusion in the statistical analysis of the study and are considered for inclusion in the body of the clinical study report. An initial assessment of the individual protocol deviations is made by the study clinician. Review of individual and aggregate cumulative protocol deviations, which include all aspects of subject participation in the study, are used by the study team to understand study issues and evaluate the protocol, including operational procedures, to identify areas where retraining may be required or modification to procedures are necessary for compliance to the protocol. Periodic and aggregate cumulative adverse events, serious adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings are reviewed by the study clinician to identify expected and unexpected safety signals and to identify subjects who potentially should be discontinued from the study. If an event is identified that would require subject discontinuation, the site is informed of this finding by the study team and if the subject is found to require discontinuation, discontinuation is required. The performance standard for this study is at least monthly review of individual protocol deviations, adverse events and laboratory abnormalities with aggregate cumulative review of these events at least quarterly during the conduct of the study and once after database lock. If the clinician determines that a protocol deviation affected the safe use of study drug in a manner that directly resulted in a serious adverse event (SAE), exposure during pregnancy, or was likely to recur and could affect the safe use of the drug in a manner that would likely result in an SAE or exposure during pregnancy, the event is forwarded to a cross-functional team that assesses the documentation and determines if the event meets the criteria, a protocol deviation alert letter, explaining the deviation is sent to participating investigators. If unexpected signals are identified in the safety database, the event(s) will be brought to the Safety Risk Management Committee for review and evaluation across all studies in the tofacitinib program and reported internally and externally, as required for the event.

The Alliance Partner will have risk/mitigation plans in place to identify specific remedial actions to be taken, depending on the reason for ineligibility of the subject; these actions will be implemented with specific steps taken dependent upon the reason for the deviation (CTPQS-106 Plan and Manage Study Execution, Version 3, Effective Date: 15-Feb-2013). 13.5. Adherence to Assigned Treatment Performance Standard The purpose of this performance standard is to identify the standard by which subjects are determined to be compliant with their assigned treatment during the study and how they will be handled in the analysis of study data. Adherence to the assigned treatment is necessary to the integrity of the study analysis, which is dependent upon exposure to the assigned treatments. Compliance is determined by pill and syringe counts as described in Section 5.3.5 and study treatment and concomitant medication dosing logs. There are several performance standards for compliance for this study:  < 80% compliant with the dosage regimen for any one of the orally administered study medications or have not used 2 or more injectable syringes expected to be used over the time between scheduled visits.  These subjects will be counseled and the site will implement appropriate measures to secure subject compliance, including instituting interim visits to evaluate and encourage compliance, as appropriate to the site and reason for non- compliance.  < 70% compliant with the dosage regimen for any one of the orally administered study medications or have not used 2 or more injectable syringes expected to be used over the time between scheduled visits.  The reason for non-compliance with the dosing regimen should be documented in the dosing log of the subject’s case report form, and should be reported as a protocol deviation and unless there is a protocol stipulated reason for non- compliance with the dosing regimen, this should be recorded as a dosing error.  > 120% compliance with the dosing regimen for any one of the orally administered study medications or have not used 2 or more injectable syringes expected to be used over the time between scheduled visits.  The reason for non-compliance (more than expected consumption) with the dosing regimen should be documented in the dosing log of the subject’s case arenpdo rret cfoorrdme dw aitsh a t hdeo srienags oenrr foorr. non-compliance, reported as a protocol deviation, Subjects who are found to be <70% or >120% compliant with the dosage regimen for any one of the study medications at any time during the study will be censored from efficacy analyses utilizing the Per Protocol Analysis Set, but will be included in analyses utilizing the Full Analysis Set. This study is being managed by an Alliance Partner. The Alliance Partner will have risk/mitigation plans in place to identify specific remedial actions to be taken, depending on the reason non-compliance with the dosing regimen; these actions will be implemented if the event exceeds the respective performance standard (CTPQS-106 Plan and Manage Study Execution, Version 3, Effective Date: 15-Feb-2013). 13.6. Cross-Ins Performance Standard Subjects will either remain in their respective assigned treatment (tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, adalimumab 40 mg QOW or etanercept 50 mg weekly) or be identified as being switched to standard of care, which may include tofacitinib, adalimumab or etanercept if those compounds are standard of care in their locality. Therefore, a performance standard for Cross-Ins is not relevant to this study. 13.7. Subject Retention Performance Standard The purpose of this performance standard is to identify subject retention performance standards and to define the actions to be taken if the performance standard is not met. The performance standard for subject retention within their assigned treatment group is an assigned treatment discontinuation rate of approximately 15% annually during the conduct of the study with higher discontinuation rates seen during the first year of the study. The expected assigned treatment discontinuation rates were developed from overall discontinuation rates seen in tofacitinib RA Phase 2/3 studies and the Long-Term Extension Studies and have been applied to this study as the projected performance standard for subject retention within their assigned treatment group. Discontinuation rates, including reason for discontinuation, are collected and reviewed by the study clinician periodically during the study. Discontinuation rates will be evaluated at least monthly for trends in total rates and components of these rates (eg, adverse events, insufficient clinical response, no longer willing to participate). This study is being managed by an Alliance Partner. The Alliance Partner will have risk/mitigation plans in place to identify specific remedial actions to be taken, depending on the reason for the increased rate in discontinuation; these actions will be implemented if the rate of discontinuation exceeds the performance standard. However, intermediate interventions may be applied if component rates are trending upwards and reasons can be identified and addressed by the study team (eg, inappropriate subject selection, retraining of s1i5te-Fs,e ebt-c2)0(1C3T).PQS-106 Plan and Manage Study Execution, Version 3, Effective Date: 13.8. Timeliness of Data Performance Standard The purpose of this performance standard is to evaluate timeliness of data entry and define actions to be taken if the performance standard is not met. The performance standard for timeliness of data entry is compliance to the requirement that investigators complete data entry into the case report form (CRF) within four (4) calendar days of that data becoming available. This study is being managed by an Alliance Partner. The Alliance Partner will have a process in place to monitor timely CRF data entry that includes monthly monitor review of investigator performance to data entry timelines and a structured action plan and escalation/communication process triggered by site performance with data entry timelines (CTPQS-113 Study Site Initiation, Monitoring and Closure, Version 5, Effective Date: 15-Feb-2013). 14. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL 14.1. End of Trial in a Member State End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is deemed that sufficient subjects have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the regulatory application (ie, Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the Member State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal conclusion to the study in that Member State. 14.2. End of Trial in all Other Participating End of Trial in all other participating countries is defined as that time when sufficient subjects have been recruited and completed the study (or the study is prematurely terminated by the Sponsor) and the database has been locked for the final study analysis. 15. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, a recommendation by the DMC, a recommendation by the Steering Committee, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of tofacitinib for use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis at any time. If a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the investigator. After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects and the hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within one week. As directed by Pfizer, all study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible. 16. PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS 16.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov). Pfizer registers study protocols and posts Basic Results on ClincialTrials.gov for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies in human subjects that evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of a Pfizer product. The results are posted in a tabular format called Basic Results. For studies involving a Pfizer product, the timing of the posting depends on whether the Pfizer product is approved for marketing in any country at the time the study is completed:  For studies involving products applicable under the US Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), ie, FDA-approved products, Pfizer posts results within one year of the primary completion date (PCD). For studies involving products approved in any country, but not FDA approved, Pfizer posts results one year from last subject, last visit (LSLV);  For studies involving products that are not yet approved in any country, Pfizer posts the results of already-completed studies within 30 days of US regulatory approval, or one year after the first ex-US regulatory approval of the product (if only submitted for approval ex-US);  For studies involving products whose drug development is discontinued before approval, Pfizer posts the results within one year of discontinuation of the program (if there are no plans for outlicensing or within two years if outlicensing plans have not completed). Primary Completion Date is defined as the date that the final subject was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary outcome, whether the clinical trial concluded according to the pre-specified protocol or was terminated. 16.2. Publications by Investigators Pfizer has no objection to publication by Investigator of any information collected or generated by Investigator, whether or not the results are favorable to the Investigational Drug. However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of Confidential Information or unprotected Inventions, Investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity to review any proposed publication or other type of disclosure before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed. Investigator will provide manuscripts, abstracts, or the full text of any other intended disclosure (poster presentation, invited speaker or guest lecturer presentation, etc.) to Pfizer at least 30 days before they are submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed. If any patent action is required to protect intellectual property rights, Investigator agrees to delay the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days.

The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism Classification Criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis16 Score Target population (Who should be tested?): Patients who 1. Have at least 1 joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling)* 2. With the synovitis not better explained by another disease† Classification criteria for RA (score-based algorithm: add score of categories A-D; a score of ≥6/10 is needed for classification of a patient as having definite RA)‡ Joint involvement§ 1 large joint¶ 0 2-10 large joints 1 1-3 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)# 2 4-10 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) 3 >10 joints (at least 1 small joint)** 5 Serology (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)†† Negative RF and negative ACPA 0 Low-positive RF or low-positive ACPA 2 High-positive RF or high-positive ACPA 3 Acute-phase reactants (at least 1 test result is needed for classification)‡‡ Normal CRP and normal ESR 0 Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR 1 Duration of symptoms§§ <6 weeks 0 ≥6 weeks 1 *The criteria are aimed at classification of newly presenting patients. In addition, patients with erosive disease typical of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a history compatible with prior fulfillment of the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. Patients with longstanding disease, including those whose disease is inactive (with or without treatment) who, based on retrospectively available data, have previously fulfilled the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. †Differential diagnoses vary among patients with different presentations, but may include conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and gout. If it is unclear about the relevant differential diagnoses to consider an expert rheumatologist should be consulted. ‡Although patients with a score of <6/10 are not classifiable as having RA, their status can be reassessed and the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time. §Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging evidence of synovitis. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment. Categories of joint distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on the pattern of joint involvement. ¶“Large joints” refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. #“Small joints” refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists. **In this category, at least 1 of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere (eg., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, etc.). †† Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but ≤3 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that are >3 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. Where rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as low-positive for RF. ACPA = anti-citrullinated protein antibody.‡‡Normal/abnormal is determined by local laboratory standards. CRP = C-reactive protein; ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate. §§ Duration of symptoms refers to patient self-report of the duration of signs or symptoms of synovitis (eg, pain, swelling, tenderness) of joints that are clinically involved at the time of assessment, regardless of treatment status. Appendix 2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications Prohibited drugs, including investigational compounds, require discontinuation for at least 7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior the Baseline visit. All investigational compounds, other than study drug, are prohibited during the study. Only systemically administered drugs listed below are prohibited; topical, ophthalmic, or intravaginal administration is allowed. * Discontinue for at least 30 days **See Section 5.5.2 for specific washout requirements and Section 5.6.1 for using standard of care treatment in subjects who are not controlled with their respective study drug. Appendix 3. Cockcroft-Gault Formula for Estimating GFR Creatinine Clearance (estimated) / Conventional mL/min = ((140 - Age (years)) X Weight (kg) X Factora) / (72 X Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)) a Factor is equal to 0.85 in females and 1.00 in males. Appendix 4. Sweden-Specific Protocol Requirements The content of this Appendix is deleted as no subject was screened or enrolled in Sweden. Appendix 5. Czech Republic, Spain and United Kingdom Specific Protocol Requirements In the Czech Republic, Spain and the United Kingdom, the following changes have been made to the protocol sections listed: 4.2. Exclusion Criteria Additional exclusion criteria apply: 6. c. Absolute lymphocyte count <0.75 x 109/L (<750/mm3) 6. d. Absolute neutrophil count <1.2 x 109/L (<1200/mm3) 7.10 Clinical Laboratory Tests Subjects in the listed countries who are randomized to and are receiving tofacitinib will have additional laboratory testing performed. Lymphocyte subset assessments will be conducted at each study visit (Baseline, Month 2, Month 3 and every 3 months thereafter). The lymphocyte subsets and markers to be tested are identified in Table 4. Table 4. Lymphocyte Subsets and Markers 7.15 Triggered Requirements for Monitoring Additional requirements for discontinuation of study drug include:  Opportunistic infection judged significant by the investigator.  Two sequential neutrophil counts <1000 neutrophils/mm3. Appendix 6. Canada Specific Requirements for the Use of Two Methods of Effective Contraception. Subjects in Canada who are woman of childbearing potential and sexually active must use two contraceptive methods at the same time, one highly effective contraceptive method and one additional effective contraceptive method. Highly effective contraceptive methods may include hormonal contraceptives (eg, combined oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants), intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy or tubal ligation. Effective methods may include barrier methods of contraception (eg, male condom, female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm or contraceptive sponge). The proper use of diaphragm or cervical cap includes use of spermicide and is considered one barrier method. The cervical cap and contraceptive sponge are less effective in parous women. The use of spermicide alone is not considered a suitable barrier method for contraception.
