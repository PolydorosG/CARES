Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table Amendment 1 01 October 2019 1. Amendment 1 has become necessary to update the contraception language and to align with emerging development of program safety requirements (protocol C2501003 for ulcerative colitis). Rationale: the purpose of the update is to mitigate a theoretical risk of CYP3A induction by PF-06826647 and thereby potentially lowering the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. Given the potential teratogenicity risk of PF-06826647, the addition of a barrier method for female participants on hormonal contraception is included. Since the expected maximum change in exposure based on fraction metabolized [f ] m value is approximately 2-fold, the ethinylestradiol containing contraceptives are now allowed. See Section 4.3, 5.3.1 & Appendix 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 for details. 2. Removed body mass index (BMI) see Section 5.1 Inclusion Criteria #6. Rationale: It does not impact PK or PD. 3. Added two exclusion criteria see Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria: #13. History of recurrent (>2) venous thrombosis or any arterial thromboembolism or known blood clotting disorders. #14. History of acute coronary syndrome (eg, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris) and any history of cerebrovascular disease within 24 weeks before screening. Rational: to clarify and provide more specific language on the criteria. 4. Added language to Discontinuation of Study Intervention involving thromboembolic events see Section 7.1. Rationale: to provide consistency across the program. 5. Added language to Safety Adjudication Committee Section 9.5.2. Rational: to align with program language to specifically include events requiring adjudication are cardiovascular events including venous thromboembolic events (VTE). 6. The content of five Protocol Administrative Clarification Letters (PACLs) # 1-5 was added.  PACL 1: 1) HIV serology should also include Hep B tests as described in EC #21. 2) Appendix 2 should include the above. 3) PROs should be completed in a certain same order (pre and post Day 15). Rationale: to ensure consistency throughout protocol.  PACL 2: typographical error of absolute lymph count (should be 1000 not 800). Rationale: clarification.  PACL 3 JAPAN Only: EC #23 clarified subjects will have HBV DNA testing if there is no documentation of HBV vaccination. Rationale: country requirement.  PACL 4: Concomitant medications guselkumab and risankizumab were washout. Rationale: frequently asked question by Investigators regarding new therapeutics.  PACL 5: 1) C-SSRS footnote to clarify the use of “Lifetime” version at baseline. 2) PRO footnote to clarify pre-dose to be consistent with other sections. 3) discrepancy clarified that no live vaccines allowed 8 weeks after last dose. 4) Justification for Dose section 4.3 discrepancy corrected to confirm 83% not 82%. Rationale: to ensure consistency throughout protocol.  Additional discrepancies were eliminated, and typographical errors corrected. This amendment incorporates all revisions to date, including amendments made at the request of country health authorities and institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs).

PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1. Synopsis Rationale: This multicenter study is being conducted to provide additional PF-06826647 safety and tolerability data, and to further explore the clinical efficacy of PF-06826647 in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Additionally, the study is intended to enable selection of oral dose and dosing regimen for the future clinical development of PF-06826647. Objectives, Endpoints, and Estimands: Investigational Treatment Period: Secondary: Secondary: Secondary: without the benefit of additional To compare the effect of multiple dose  Absolute score and prohibited medications, regardless levels of PF-06822647 versus placebo change from baseline in of participants compliance with in Peak-Pruritus Numerical Rating Peak-Pruritus Numerical the IP dosing. Scale score in participants with Rating Scale score at time moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. points specified in the Population: Participants with SoA. moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as defined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria without the benefit of additional prohibited medications regardless of compliance. Intercurrent Events: A) Prohibited medication – all scores after participants receive prohibited medication will be omitted from the analysis and treated as missing scores. Missing scores will be imputed based on the assumption that participants do not benefit from the IP treatment. B) Withdrawal and all other events leading to missing data will be treated similarly as in A. C) Inadequate compliance – participants data will be used as recorded. Population level summary: The mean difference between treated and placebo arms of the change from baseline PASI score. All continuous endpoint, when appropriate will be analyzed descriptively and using estimand E2 described above when appropriate. Extension Treatment Period: Overall Design: This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, and multicenter study in participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Following a Screening period of up to 6 weeks, is a 16 week placebo controlled Investigational Treatment Period with double blind oral daily treatment using the following doses: 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg. All participants completing the 16 week Investigational Period may continue on to a 24 week non-placebo controlled Extension Treatment Period with double blind oral daily treatment, if per the Investigator judgment the participant is compliant with study procedures and continued participation presents no safety risks. The participants continuing into the Extension Treatment Period that were originally randomized to the 200 mg and 400 mg treatment groups will continue on their respective doses, while those randomized to one of the other treatment groups (including placebo) will be randomly assigned (at study baseline) to receive either 200 mg or 400 mg during the Extension Treatment Period. The total duration of study participation will be approximately 50 weeks, including up to 6 weeks Screening, 16 week Investigational Treatment Period, 24 week Extension Treatment Period and a Follow-Up visit 4 weeks after the Extension Period ends. Number of Participants: Approximately 160 participants (40 participants in each of the following arms: placebo, 200 mg, and 400 mg; and 20 participants in each of the following arms: 50 mg and 100 mg) will be randomly assigned to a treatment group in order to ensure a minimum of 128 evaluable participants completing Week 16 (assuming a 20% dropout rate). Intervention Groups and Duration: During the Investigational Treatment Period (Weeks 0 through 16), the 160 participants will receive PF-06826647 (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg) once daily, or matching placebo and the same participants will continue onto the Extension Treatment Period. After completion of the 16 week placebo controlled Investigational Study Period, participants may transition directly into the 24 week Extension Study Period. The total duration of study participation will be approximately 50 weeks, including up to 6 weeks Screening, 16 week Investigational Treatment Period, the 24 week Extension Treatment Period and a Follow-Up visit 4 weeks after the Extension Period ends. Data Monitoring Committee: This study will use an internal review committee (IRC) (Section 9.5.1). Statistical Methods: The primary estimand will be the population average treatment effect on PASI 90 rates at Week 16 relative to placebo without regard to compliance in the absence of prohibited medication. The analysis of the primary estimand will be of the proportion of participants achieving: PASI 75 (75% or greater improvement from Baseline); PGA score clear (0) or almost clear (1) and ≥2 points improvement from baseline; PGA score clear (0) or almost clear (1); PASI 50 (50% or greater improvement from Baseline) and PASI 100 (100% or greater improvement from Baseline). The analysis of the secondary estimand will be of the change from baseline and percent change from baseline in PASI scores; and absolute score and change from baseline in Peak-Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score. All other key secondary continuous clinical endpoints will be analyzed using the secondary estimand, while all other key secondary categorical clinical endpoints will be analyzed using the primary estimand. 1.2.

INTRODUCTION PF-06826647 is a potent tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor with a favorable selectivity profile over other human kinases and is being investigated in participants with plaque psoriasis. Based on its cytokine inhibition profile, PF-06826647 is expected to target the T-helper 1 (Th1), T-helper 17 (Th17), and Types I interferon signaling pathways directly by inhibiting TYK2. This should provide therapeutic benefit in the treatment of inflammatory conditions driven by Th1/Th17 and interferon immune responses. 2.1. Study Rationale The purpose of this multicenter, placebo controlled double blind study is to provide additional efficacy, safety, tolerability CCI data regarding PF-06826647 in the oral treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It is intended to enable dose selection for the future development of PF-06826647. 2.2. Background The most common variant of psoriasis or plaque psoriasis, is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune skin disease characterized by red, scaly, raised plaques. Chronic plaque psoriasis is a common skin disorder with a worldwide prevalence of 2% and afflicts an estimated 7.4 million Americans. Although psoriasis primarily affects the skin and is not a life threatening disease, it can profoundly impact the patient’s quality of life (QoL) resulting in impairment akin to other major diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and psoriatic arthritis.1 The Janus kinase (JAK) family, which includes JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, is a group of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via interactions with Type 1 and Type 2 cytokine receptors critical for immune cell function, survival, activation, and proliferation.2 TYK2 pairs with JAK1 to mediate type I interferon (IFN) signaling and with JAK2 to transmit interleukin (IL) IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. Both of these key cytokines are implicated in the pathophysiology of plaque psoriasis. IL-12 and IL-23 require TYK2 for signal transduction,3 indicating that inhibition of TYK2 mediated signaling could be efficacious in the treatment of these inflammatory conditions. Over activation of Th17 and the main effector cytokines of Th17 cells has been linked to various inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis.4 Th17 cells are elevated in psoriatic lesions, along with levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17C, which are expressed by Th17 cells and are likely mediators of inflammation and tissue damage.5 Human genetic studies implicate the Th17 pathway in psoriasis, and have uncovered likely risk alleles which include genes involved in IL-23 signaling and genes that function downstream of the IL-17 receptor.6 In addition to genetic evidence, several effective psoriasis therapies target Th17 cytokine production, suggesting a central role of Th17 and IL-17 in the disease. The newest and most effective therapeutics are directed to the cytokines and cytokine signaling of interleukin-23/type 17 T cell (IL-23/T17) axis.7 Additionally, the TYK2-selective inhibitor, BMS-986165, recently showed efficacy in a Phase 2 psoriasis study.8 Thus, there is strong rationale for targeting the Th17 pathway in the 2.2.1. Non-Clinical Safety Studies with PF-06826647 No adverse findings were observed in oral repeat dose toxicity studies with PF-06826647 in rats and monkeys up to 6 and 9 months in duration, respectively. Test article related, nonadverse, target organs identified include the immune and hemolymphatic systems (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, erythron, and leukon), liver (increased transaminases), and bone (increased trabecular thickness). The findings in the immune and hemolymphatic systems are consistent with the pharmacological activity of PF-06826647. In the 6-month toxicity study in rats, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 500 mg/kg/day (250 mg/kg BID) with unbound and total maximum concentration Cmax values of 1680 and 9360 ng/mL, respectively, and unbound and total AUC (area under the 24 curve 24 hours) values of 16,600 and 92,000 ng•h/mL, respectively. In the 9-month toxicity study in monkeys, the NOAEL was 220 mg/kg/day with unbound and total C values of max 663 and 1950 ng/mL, respectively, and unbound and total AUC values of 8130 and 24 23,900 ng•h/mL, respectively. In an embryo fetal development study in rabbits, adverse PF-06826647-related embryolethality due to higher incidence of late resorptions resulting in higher postimplantation loss and lower number of live fetuses was observed at 500 mg/kg/day (unbound C of 1290 ng/mL and AUC of 17,300 ng•h/mL). The max 24 developmental NOAEL in rats was 500 mg/kg/day (unbound C of 1850 ng/mL and AUC max 24 of 19,600 ng•h/mL), and in rabbits was 150 mg/kg/day (unbound C of 864 ng/mL and max AUC of 9930 ng•h/mL). PF-06826647 was not mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation 24 assays. Although PF-06826647 was positive for micronuclei formation in vitro (through an aneugenic mechanism), it did not induce micronuclei in vivo in rats at 500 mg/kg/day (250 mg/kg BID) (unbound C of 2110 ng/mL and AUC of 24,100 ng•h/mL), the highest max 24 dose tested in the 1-month study. No evidence of PF-06826647 related phototoxicity in the skin or eyes of pigmented rats in a 3-day phototoxicity study was observed up to the highest dose tested of 500 mg/kg/day, demonstrating that PF-06826647 was not a phototoxicant, in vivo. Further details of the nonclinical safety program are provided in the current investigator’s brochure. 2.2.2. Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Single dose pharmacokinetic studies with PF-06826647 were conducted after oral and intravenous (IV) administration to mice and rats. PF-06826647 had moderate oral bioavailability (26% to 51%) utilizing a sprayed-dried dispersion (SDD) formulation versus 0.5% methyl cellulose (<1% to 12%). After IV administration, PF-06826647 demonstrated a steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of approximately 0.9 to 1.4 L/kg and a low plasma clearance (CL [10 to 18 mL/min/kg]), relative to mouse and rat liver blood flows. Systemic exposures (maximum observed concentrations [C ] and area under the concentration time max curve [AUC]) of PF-06826647 after repeat oral dosing in the pivotal toxicity studies increased with increasing dose in rats (up to 500 mg/kg/day) and monkeys (up to 300 mg/kg/day) in a less than dose-proportional manner. No sex-related differences in exposure and no accumulation of PF-06826647 were observed over the dosing period in either species. In vitro, PF-06826647 showed high apparent passive permeability and may be between 62% to 82%, and PF-06826647 does not preferentially partition into red blood cells from nonclinical species and humans. Renal and biliary excretion of PF-06826647 was limited in the rat. No unique human metabolites were observed in vitro compared to metabolite profiles in rat and monkey. The major human clearance pathway for PF-06826647 is expected to be hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism by CYP1A2 (fraction metabolized [f ] = 0.53), CYP2D6 (f = m m 0.26) and CYP3A (f = 0.21). PF-06826647 did not inhibit the major cytochrome CYP450 m or UDP- glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGT) (half maximal inhibitory concentration IC >25 μM). PF-06826647 induced CYP3A4 messenger Ribonucleic acid (mRNA) 50 expression in 1 of 3 lots of hepatocytes (≥4.7-fold increase at ≥10 μM), but no corresponding induction was seen in CYP3A4 enzymatic activity. Induction of CYP1A2 enzyme activity occurred in 2 lots of hepatocytes (approximately 2-fold at ≥10 μM), and PF-06826647 did not induce CYP2B6 mRNA levels or enzymatic activity. Based on its in vitro profile, the potential for PF-06826647 mediated CYP450 or UGT drug interactions is low at clinically relevant concentrations (C 355 nM; C 135 nM). max max,u PF-06826647 showed little to no inhibition of the multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE1), multidrug resistant protein 1 (MDR1), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP2), MRP3, sodium/taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP), organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3 and organic cation transporter (OCT) 2. However, PF-06826647 did inhibit MATE2K with an estimated IC value of 0.53 μM. 50 2.2.3. Clinical Overview The clinical development program for PF-06826647 is currently comprised of a placebo-controlled Phase 1 study (C2501001). In this study, six Single Ascending Dose (SAD) cohorts and five Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) cohorts in healthy participants completed, with 69 healthy adult participants randomized and treated with PF-06826647 or placebo. The study also included one cohort of 6 healthy Japanese participants who received 400 mg once daily (QD) and 2 cohorts of participants (total 40) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (First-in-Patient) who received 400 mg or 100 mg QD of PF-06826647 or placebo. Psoriasis participants received active treatment with PF-06826647 (100 mg or 400 mg QD for 28 days) had clinically meaningful decreases in disease activity as measured by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), the defined primary endpoint. Safety, efficacy,CCI results from this study support further development of PF-06826647 in plaque psoriasis. The Phase 1 study (C2501001) demonstrated an acceptable safety and pharmacokinetic profile at single doses of PF-06826647 ranging from 3 mg to 1600 mg in the SAD portion and ten-day dosing from 10 mg to 1200 mg daily in the MAD portion of the study. Dose escalation stopping rules were not triggered. There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECG), or potential Hy’s Law cases reported during this study. In addition, there were no serious adverse events (including death) or Suspected, Unexpected, Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) reported. Based on preliminary review of treatment group data, all reported treatment emergent adverse events have been of mild intensity. Additionally, clinical benefit was observed in participant cohorts with plaque psoriasis as measured by the change from baseline in PASI scores over a 28-day treatment period. In the participants completing 28 days of treatment with PF-06826647, the mean placebo-adjusted change from baseline PASI score at Week 4 was -14.02 (n=20) for the 400 mg QD cohort and -4.55 (n=15) for the 100 mg QD cohort. Please refer to Benefit/Risk Assessment Section 2.3 for more details on the clinical safety of PF-06826647. CCI CCI CCI 2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment PF-06826647 is expected to offer therapeutic benefit in the treatment of psoriasis. More specifically, inhibition of IL-12 and IL-23 signaling mediated by TYK2 inhibitory activity may provide a new and improved therapeutic benefit due to potential achievement of disease control, improvement of signs and symptoms, as well as improvements in quality of life. Overall, the safety profile observed during the Phase 1 program for PF-06826647 appears to be acceptable at dosages up to 1200 mg daily administered orally over 10 days. A longer dosing duration was explored in participants with moderate to severe psoriasis, who received the maximum PF-06826647 dose level of 400 mg and 100 mg daily for 28 days. No serious or severe AEs were reported in the Phase 1 study. There was one psoriasis participant in the 400 mg cohort who met the protocol pre-specified stopping criteria due to decreased level of lymphocytes, although this participant had borderline low lymphocytes at baseline. As with other immunomodulators, the risk of infection is a potential concern due to the immunosuppressive effects of PF-06826647. In conclusion, the sponsor considers that the available information from the nonclinical and clinical data to date regarding PF-06826647 provide a favorable benefit-risk profile and supports its continued investigation as a potential treatment for plaque psoriasis. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events (AEs) of PF-06826647 may be found in the investigator’s brochure, which is the single reference safety document (SRSD) for this study. 3.

Overall Design This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicenter study in participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. After a screening period of - up to 6 weeks, eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1:1:2:2 ratio such that participants will receive placebo or either one of four PF-06826647 daily dose levels (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg or 400 mg) every day during the Investigational Treatment Period for 16 weeks in a blinded fashion. All participants completing the 16-week Investigational Period will continue to a 24-week non-placebo-controlled Extension Treatment Period with double blind oral daily treatment, if per the Investigator judgment the participant is compliant with study procedures and continued participation presents no safety risks. The participants continuing into the Extension Treatment Period that were originally randomized to the 200 mg and 400 mg treatment groups will continue their respective doses, while those randomized to one of the other treatment groups (including placebo) will be randomly assigned (at study baseline) to receive either 200 mg or 400 mg during the Extension Treatment Period. Participants who discontinue prior to Week 16 visit will have an Early Termination visit and will not be eligible for the Extension Period. Approximately 160 participants (40 participants in each of the following arms: placebo, 200 mg, and 400 mg; and 20 participants in each of the following arms: 50 mg and 100 mg) will be randomly assigned to a treatment group in order to ensure a minimum of 128 evaluable participants completing Week 16 (assuming a 20% dropout rate). The total duration of study participation will be approximately 50 weeks, including up to 6 weeks Screening Period, 16-week Investigational Treatment Period, the 24-week Extension Treatment Period and a Follow-Up visit 4 weeks after the Extension Treatment Period. If a participant is withdrawn from investigational product (IP) treatment, the participant will proceed with the Early Termination (ET) and Follow Up visits per Schedule of Activities. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study is being conducted to provide data on efficacy, safety, tolerability, CCI of PF-06826647 in the oral treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The chronic toxicology package supports the planned study duration. The treatment duration of 16 weeks in this Phase 2 study (C2501004) will allow for further exploration of the clinical safety and efficacy that was observed in the 4-week Phase 1 (C2501001) study in a small (n=40) number of psoriasis participants. The PASI 90 score at Week 16 will be assessed as the study’s primary endpoint. The 50 mg once daily (QD) PF-06826647 dose will be explored in order to identify the minimal clinically efficacious dose after 16 weeks of treatment. In order to further characterize the dose-response relationship, this study will explore 100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg for 16 weeks during the Investigational Treatment Period of the study. Based on the exposure-response modeling with the PASI data observed up to Week 4, the projected PASI 90 response rates at 200 mg and 400 mg are 47% and 83% at Week 16 respectively, while 50 mg and 100 mg are expected to provide <15% PASI 90 response rate. For this reason, the 50 mg and 100 mg treatment groups will have a smaller allocation of participants as compared to the other treatment groups. Furthermore, participants randomized to placebo, 50 mg, and 100 mg doses during the Investigational Treatment Period will receive either 200 mg or 400 mg during the Extension Study Period in order to evaluate additional safety, tolerability, and durability of response to PF-06826647 at expected clinically efficacious doses. Since PF-06826647 is metabolized primarily by CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, the strong and moderate inducers and inhibitors of these drug metabolizing enzymes are prohibited. Dofetilide being a MATE substrate is also prohibited because PF-06826647 is a MATE2K substrate and can potentially increase exposure. The requirement for female participants using hormonal contraceptives to use an additional barrier method may be removed if supported by the outcome of an ongoing oral contraceptive PK interaction study (Study C2501005). CCI Patient reported outcomes will evaluate changes in psoriasis symptoms and health-related quality of life. These utility scores will be further utilized for development of an early cost-effectiveness model. The potential risk of exposure to PF-06826647 in a sexual partner of a male participant in this study via ejaculate is low, and therefore no barrier contraception (condom) use in male participants is warranted. The calculated safety margin is ≥100-fold between the estimated partner exposure due to seminal transfer and the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for serious manifestations of developmental toxicity in nonclinical studies. The safety margin of 100-fold is based on applying a 10-fold safety factor for interspecies extrapolation and a 10-fold safety factor for susceptible populations. CCI 4.3. Justification for Dose Dose selection for this study was based on expected average inhibition of IL-12, IL-23, and IFNα as well as projected in vivo efficacy observed in psoriasis participants without significant JAK2 inhibition. Four dosing (50 mg QD, 100 mg QD, 200 mg QD and 400 mg QD) regimens of PF-06826647 and placebo were selected to explore the dose range in moderate to severe psoriasis participants given the practical considerations. CCI Based on the exposure-response modeling with the PASI data observed up to Week 4, the projected PASI 90 response rates of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg were 3%, 13%, 47%, and 83% at Week 16, respectively. However, there is uncertainty in the extrapolation of response from Week 4 to Week 16. Although the projected PASI 90 response rates of 50 mg QD is low, the projected average inhibition (Table 3) based on in vitro IC value 50 determined by phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (pSTAT) modulation in human whole blood, red blood cell (RBC) partition ratio of 1.4 and assuming Hill coefficient of 1, the average daily inhibition of IL-12, IL-23, IFNα is approximately 82%, 69% and 79%, respectively. Considering both the projected PASI 90 response rate and the average inhibition of IL-12 and IL-23, 50 mg was selected as the lowest pharmacologically active dose that would be expected to be clinically minimally efficacious. The highest dose of 400 mg QD was selected based on practical considerations of daily tablet burden to participants and projected high degree of inhibition (>90%) of IL-12, IL-23 and IFNα (Table 3) at steady state. Additionally, based on data observed to date in both healthy and psoriasis participants, these doses are expected to be safe and well tolerated. All the adverse events (AEs) observed in healthy participants up to 1200 mg QD for 10 days and psoriasis participants up to 400 mg QD for 28 days were mild in nature. Although, the projected average inhibition of erythropoietin (EPO) (Table 3) was 67% and a transient decrease in reticulocyte was observed in psoriasis participants at 400 mg QD, no clinically meaningful change in hemoglobin was observed at the same dose for 28 days in psoriasis participants. The As shown in the Table 3, highest dose of 400 mg QD at steady state is expected to provide margins of about 2-fold for C and about 3-fold for AUC relative to the total exposure max (NOAEL) in the monkey 9-month chronic toxicity study. In Study C2501001, the 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio in urine was evaluated as a marker of CYP3A induction but there were no differences between PF-06826647 treated versus placebo participants. Thus, the risk of induction of metabolic pathways is considered low. Ethinylestradiol (EE) containing oral contraceptives (OC) has been shown to increase the exposure of CYP1A2 substrates such as caffeine. Based on in vitro experiments, the major human clearance pathway for PF-06826647 is expected to be hepatic CYP-mediated metabolism by CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP3A out of which CYP1A2 is expected to contribute ~53%. Therefore, the highest expected increase in exposure of PF-06826647 based on CYP1A2 inhibition is ~2-fold. The predicted exposure margins for Total C and max Total AUC with ~2-fold increase in exposure at the highest dose of 400 mg QD is approximately 0.94 and 1.67, respectively. With maximum expected increase in exposure of PF-06826647 due to interaction with EE, the maximum expected erythropoietin (EPO) inhibition at 400 mg QD will be approximately 80%. Reticulocyte count and hemoglobin level will be monitored on a regular basis in the study for safety CCI for EPO inhibition. The Phase 1 study (C2501001) demonstrated an acceptable safety profile at single doses of PF-06826647 ranging from 3 mg to 1600 mg in the single ascending portion and ten-day doses from 10 mg to 1200 mg daily in the multiple ascending portion of the study. Dose escalation stopping rules were not triggered. There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital signs, ECGs, or potential Hy’s Law cases reported during this study. In addition, there were no serious AEs (including death) or suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) reported. All reported Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were of mild intensity. The 200 mg and 400 mg doses were selected for the Extension Treatment Period due to the higher projected PASI 90 response rates at these doses. Based on the exposure-response modeling with the PASI data observed up to Week 4, the projected PASI 90 response rates at 200 mg and 400 mg are 47% and 83% at Week 16 respectively, while 50 mg and 100 mg are expected to provide <15% PASI 90 response rate. 4.4.

If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is >450 msec, this interval should be rate-corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the participant’s eligibility. Computer-interpreted ECGs should be over read by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants. 25.

Other Exclusions: 26. Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or Sponsor employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of the study. 27. Have a history of alcohol or substance abuse, unless in full remission for greater than 6 months prior to Day 1. 5.3. Lifestyle Considerations In order to participate in the study, participants must be made aware of the following life style guidelines and restrictions that apply during and after the study period. Details of these life style guidelines are provided in sections as noted.  On appropriate study visit days, comply with fasting requirement (water only) for at least 8 hours prior to the visit, as indicated in the Schedule of Activities.  On study visit days, do not smoke or ingest caffeine (eg, tea, coffee, some soft drinks/colas/energy drinks and power bars) during the 30 minutes prior to blood pressure and pulse rate measurements.  Only on study visit days, do not take the dose of study drug until instructed to do so by the investigator or designated study site staff while at the study site.  On study visit days, showering or bathing is permitted prior to attending the study visit, but do not moisturize.  On study visit days, take prescribed permitted concomitant medication, as needed, prior to the study visit, if it can be administered with water only. Prescribed permitted concomitant medications that must be taken with food or after meals should not be taken until after the visit procedures have been completed.  Contact the study site investigator if there are any changes or additions to concomitant medications.  As needed, participants may use the treatments listed as permitted in Section 6.5 for the specified body sites described. On clinic visit days, do not use any of these treatments until after the clinic visit is completed.  Abstain from strenuous exercise (eg, heavy lifting, weight training, calisthenics, and aerobics) for at least 48 hours prior to each blood collection for clinical laboratory tests. Walking at a normal pace is permitted.  Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and avoid use of tanning booths or other ultraviolet light sources during the study.  Herbal supplements must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Refrain from excessive consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice or citrus fruits eg, Seville oranges, pomelos within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication It is recommended that participants avoid excessive consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice or citrus fruits eg, Seville oranges or pomelos not to exceed 8 ounces (~240 mL) total in a day while in the study. 5.3.1. Contraception The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the participant, will confirm that the participant has selected an appropriate method of contraception for the individual participant and his or her partner(s) from the permitted list of contraception methods (see Appendix 4 Section 10.4.4) and will confirm that the participant has been instructed in its consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities (SoA), the investigator or designee will inform the participant of the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document the conversation and the participant’s affirmation in the participant’s chart (participants need to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least 1 or 2 of the selected methods of contraception). In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the participant to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the participant or partner. Female participants using hormonal contraceptives are required to use an additional acceptable barrier method listed in Contraception (Section 10.4.4) during the study and until 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 5.3.2. Vaccination Vaccination with live virus, attenuated live virus, or any live viral components is prohibited within the 6 weeks prior to Day 1, during the study, and within the 8 weeks following the last dose of study drug. Similarly, current routine household contact with individuals who have been vaccinated with live vaccine components should be avoided in the same period. This is due to the potential for virus to be shed in bodily fluids (including stool) following vaccination with live component vaccines, leading to a potential risk that the virus may be transmitted. Such vaccines include: FluMist® (intranasal influenza vaccine), attenuated rotavirus vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, attenuated typhoid fever vaccine, oral polio vaccine, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and vaccinia (smallpox) vaccine. 5.3.3. Other Lifestyle Requirements In order to participate in the study, participants must be made aware of the following life style guidelines and restrictions that apply during and after the study period.

On appropriate study visit days, comply with fasting requirement (water only) for at least 8 hours prior to the visit, as indicated in the Schedule of Activities. 2. On study visit days, do not smoke or ingest caffeine (eg, tea, coffee, some soft drinks/colas/energy drinks and power bars) during the 30 minutes prior to blood pressure and pulse (heart) rate measurements. 3. Only on study visit days, do not take the dose of study drug until instructed to do so by the investigator or designated study site staff while at the study site. 4. On study visit days, showering or bathing is permitted prior to attending the study visit, but do not moisturize. 5. On study visit days, take prescribed permitted concomitant medication, as needed, prior to the study visit, if it can be administered with water only. Prescribed permitted concomitant medications that must be taken with food or after meals should not be taken until after the visit procedures have been completed. 6. Contact the study site investigator if there are any changes or additions to concomitant medications. 7. As needed, participants may use the treatments listed as permitted in Section 6.5 for the specified body sites described. On clinic visit days, do not use any of these treatments until after the clinic visit is completed. 8. Abstain from strenuous exercise (eg, heavy lifting, weight training, calisthenics, and aerobics) for at least 48 hours prior to each blood collection for clinical laboratory tests. Walking at a normal pace is permitted. 9. Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and avoid use of tanning booths or other ultraviolet light sources during the study. 10. Herbal supplements must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication. Refrain from excessive consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice or citrus fruits eg, Seville oranges, pomelos or within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication. It is recommended that participants avoid excessive consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice or citrus fruits eg, Seville oranges or pomelos exceeding 8 ounces (~240 mL) total in a day while in the study. 5.4. Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomly assigned to investigational product. Screen failure data are collected and remain as source and are not reported to the clinical database. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE). Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened once. Re-screened participants will be re-consented. All screening assessments must be repeated during re-screening, with the exception of chest radiograph, HIV, Hepatitis and TB testing, provided re-screening is done within 3 months of screening. 6. STUDY INTERVENTION Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol. For the purposes of this protocol, the term investigational product may be used synonymously with study intervention. 6.1. Study Intervention(s) Administered Blinded PF-06826647 and matching placebo will be provided as tablets for oral administration. PF-06826647 will be provided in dosage strengths of 100 mg and 25 mg tablets. PF-06826647 and matching placebo will be supplied in blister cards and labeled according to local regulatory requirements. Participants will receive blinded labeled supplies throughout the study. To accomplish this, all participants will take a total of six tablets per day during the Investigational Treatment Period, and four tablets per day during the Extension Treatment Period. The participants continuing into the Extension Treatment Period that were originally randomized to the 200 mg and 400 mg treatment groups in the Investigational Treatment Period will continue on their respective doses, while those randomized to one of the other treatment groups including placebo will be randomly assigned at study baseline to either receive 200 mg or 400 mg during the Extension Treatment Period. 6.1.1. Administration Participants will swallow the investigational product (IP) whole and will not manipulate or chew the IP prior to swallowing. Participants will administer IP as outpatients, except on study visit days. On study visit days, participants should not take their dose of study drug until instructed to do so by the investigator or designated study site staff while at the study site. Blinded PF-06826647 tablets and matching placebo for oral administration will be dispensed in blisters. Participants will be provided dosing instructions. Sites will be trained on how participants should take tablets at home through an Investigational Product manual and/or other vehicle(s). Sites are responsible for communicating this information to participants; and site staff should review the dosing instructions with participants at every study visit. Participants should take the IP orally once daily during the Investigational Treatment Period and the Extension Treatment Period of the study. A temporary hold on dosing of the investigational product during the study for an individual participant for up to a maximum of 7 consecutive days is allowed once from Day 1 to Day 113, if the principal investigator (PI) deems it necessary because of infections (eg, upper respiratory infection, urinary tract infection), gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (eg, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) or hematological abnormalities. Any temporary hold on dosing of the investigational product during the study should be recorded in the case report form (CRF). It is recommended that the tablets be swallowed whole with ambient temperature water to a total volume of approximately 240 mL, and not to manipulate or chew the medication prior to swallowing; and it is recommended to be taken with food. On study visit days, participants are to be instructed to refrain from dosing at home and are to take the dose in the clinic from their current blister card and the dose from the newly dispensed blister card will be taken on the next day at home. If a dose is missed and the interval to the next dose is less than 8 hours, the missed dose should not be administered. 6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study interventions received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention, as 2. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study interventions must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated recording) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. At a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations must be documented and available upon request. Data for nonworking days must indicate the minimum and maximum temperature since previously documented for all site storage locations upon return to business. 3. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). All study interventions will be accounted for using an investigational product accountability form/record. The participant will be asked to bring all dispensed investigational product (including empty, partially used and unused blister packs) and the dosing diary to the clinic at every visit. Detailed drug accountability records will be maintained by study staff for each participant. 4. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are provided in the investigational product (IP) manual. 5. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded by the storage conditions stated on the product label. 6. Study interventions should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with the labels. 7. Site staff will instruct participants on the proper storage requirements for take-home study intervention. 8. Any excursions from the study intervention label storage conditions should be reported to the sponsor upon discovery along with any actions taken. The site should actively pursue options for returning the study intervention to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Once an excursion is identified, the study intervention must be quarantined and not used until the sponsor provides permission to use the study intervention. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if the sponsor approves the use of the study intervention after the temperature excursion. Use of the study intervention prior to the sponsor’s approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding the definition of an excursion and information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site in the IP manual. 9. The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused study intervention (eg, at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by the sponsor, and all destruction must be adequately documented. Additional details about accountability, storage, destruction, and excursion reporting can be found in the IP manual. 6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing The investigational product will be dispensed using an interactive response technology (IRT) drug management system at each visit per SoA. A qualified staff member will dispense the investigational product via unique container numbers in the blister cards provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule. The participant/caregiver should be instructed to maintain the product in the blister cards provided throughout the course of dosing and return the blister cards (including empty, partially used and unused blister packs) to the site at the next study visit. 6.2.2. Investigational Product Accountability The investigator site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the investigational product supplies. All investigational products will be accounted for using a drug accountability form/record. All blister cards of investigational product must be returned to the investigator by the participant at every visit and at the end of the trial. The participant will be asked to bring all dispensed investigational product (including empty, partially used and unused blister packs) and the dosing diary to the clinic at every visit. Detailed drug accountability records will be maintained by study staff for each participant. The original investigational product accountability log, or equivalent document, must be accurately completed, signed by the Investigator, and retained at the study site (with a copy supplied to the sponsor) when the study is complete. 6.2.3. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies The investigator will keep the entire investigational product returned by the participants until destruction is authorized. The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused study intervention (eg, at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by the sponsor, and all destruction must be adequately documented. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are provided in the IP manual. 6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding Allocation to treatment will occur via an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system. The system will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. Refer to subsections 6.3.1 Allocation to Investigational Product and 6.3.2 Breaking the Blind for further details. 6.3.1. Allocation to Investigational Product Allocation of participants to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive response technology (IRT) system (interactive Web-based response [IWR]). The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the participant number. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when investigational product is being supplied via the IRT system. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the participant number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. Investigational product will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the SoA. Returned investigational product must not be redispensed to the participants. The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system. 6.3.2. Breaking the Blind At the initiation of the study, the investigator site will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The method will be an electronic process. The IRT will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s treatment assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a participant’s treatment assignment unless this could delay further management of the participant. However, discussion with the sponsor in advance of unblinding is not required. If a participant’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and case report form (CRF). Any cases of unblinding will be documented in the clinical study report. The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system. 6.4. Study Intervention Compliance The participant will take the investigational product at home; compliance will be captured daily by the participant using a Dosing Diary and instructions provided by the site. The participant will be instructed to complete the Dosing Diary (each time investigational product is provided in the clinic or at home) starting with the first dose provided in the clinic on Day 1, then daily through Week 16 and through Week 40. Participant compliance with investigational product will be assessed at each visit. If a visit is missed consult the Medical Monitor. Compliance will be assessed by review of the participant-completed Dosing Diary and source documents will be placed in the participant’s study file. Participants will be instructed to bring the Dosing Diary and all dispensed investigational product supplies in the original packaging (used as well as unused) to every study visit. Non-compliance is defined as less than 80% or more than 120% of IP dosing as directed by the dosing instructions. The investigator and the sponsor have the discretion to withdraw any participant from the study for reasons of non-compliance with the dosing regimen. Investigators should indicate on the appropriate CRF page noncompliance with study intervention and provide an explanation. Inventory control of all investigational products must be rigorously maintained throughout the duration of the study until all medication has been accounted for and/or returned to the sponsor. Any discrepancies noted between drug dispensing records and the drug inventory must be reported to the sponsor. 6.5. Concomitant Therapy Permitted Concomitant Medication Prohibited Concomitant Medications 1. The following hydrocortisones are NOT permitted:  Hydrocortisone 17 butyrate.  Hydrocortisone valerate.  Hydrocortisone/hydrocortisone acetate with concentration higher than 1%. 2.

Psoralen + UVA phototherapy (PUVA). Must be discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug: a. Topical treatments that could affect psoriasis, eg, corticosteroids, tars, keratolytics, anthralin, vitamin D analogs, and retinoids. b. Exceptions – the following topical treatments are allowed: non medicated emollients for use over the whole body; low or least potent (Class 6 or 7) topical corticosteroids for the palms, soles, face, and intertriginous areas only; tar and salicylic acid preparations for the scalp only, and shampoos free of corticosteroids for the scalp only. See details in Permitted Concomitant Topical Psoriasis Treatments. c. UVB (narrowband or broadband) phototherapy. 3. Any cell-depleting agents including but not limited to rituximab within 12 months of first dose of study drug or 5 half-lives (if known), whichever is longer, or until lymphocyte count returns to normal, whichever is longer. 4. Any prior treatment with ustekinumab (Stelara®), guselkumab (gene recombinant), risankizumab (gene recombinant) or non B cell-specific lymphocyte depleting agents/therapies (eg, alemtuzumab [CamPath®], alkylating agents [eg, cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil], total lymphoid irradiation, etc); participants who have received rituximab or other selective B-lymphocyte depleting agents (including experimental agents) within 6 months of first dose of study drug or 5 half-lives (if known), whichever is longer, or until lymphocyte count returns to normal, whichever is longer. 5. Participants who are likely to receive during the study any moderate-strong CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers or CYP2D6 inhibitors or MATE substrates as listed in Appendix 8. Participants will abstain from all concomitant medications as described in Exclusion sections of the protocol and Appendix 8 Prohibited Concomitant Medications. Participants should be instructed at each visit to contact the study site investigator promptly if there are any intended changes or additions to concomitant medications. It is recommended that participants avoid changing other prescription or non-prescription drugs, vitamins, and dietary supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication and throughout the study. All concomitant medication taken during the study must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration. Medications taken after informed consent is obtained (but before the first dose of study medication) will be documented as prior medications. Medications taken after the first dose of study drug has been administered will be documented as concomitant medications. 6.5.1. Rescue Medicine There is no rescue therapy to reverse the adverse events (AEs) observed with PF-06826647; standard medical supportive care must be provided to manage the AEs. 6.6. Dose Modification Treatment assignment in the Extension Treatment Period will be predetermined according to the Scheme shown in Section 1.2. Participants who are in the placebo, 50 mg, or 100 mg treatment arms will be assigned to either 200 mg or 400 mg PF-06826647 in the Extension Treatment Period. Allocation to either dose in the Extension Treatment Period will be based on an initial treatment assignment at randomization. No dose adjustment is allowed during the study. 6.7. Intervention after the End of the Study No intervention will be provided to study participants at the end of the study. 7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue the investigational product. Per the study estimands, if investigational product is permanently discontinued, the participant will proceed to Early Termination per Schedule of Activities. The site will inform sponsor medical monitor or sponsor clinician if the below criteria for permanent discontinuation of the IP are triggered. Any participant meeting discontinuation criteria must have an Early Termination visit with their first visit occurring 1 week after their last dose whenever possible and continue visits per Investigator’s discretion until the event has returned to normal or baseline levels or is deemed clinically stable. The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. Note that discontinuation of the investigational product does not represent withdrawal from the study. Participants experiencing a thrombotic event as part of a serious adverse event must be discontinued from further IP administration and referred to a specialist for further evaluation of possible hypercoagulable state, as per local guidelines. ECG Changes A participant who meets either bulleted criterion below based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from the IP administration.  QTcF >500 msec;  Change from baseline: QTc >60 msec. If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to, changes from baseline in QTcF after enrollment), the investigator or qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study and if any change in participant management is needed. This review of the ECG printed at the time of collection must be documented. Any new clinically relevant finding should be reported as an AE. Laboratory Abnormalities All the following laboratory abnormalities require discontinuation if they are confirmed. Confirmation through re-testing should occur within 48 hours: a. Additional investigations, such as review of ethanol, recreational drug and dietary supplement consumption should be done; testing for acute hepatitis A, B or C infection and biliary tract imaging should be promptly discussed with sponsor medical monitor. b. Total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have a direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin is <ULN. Pregnancy If pregnancy is confirmed by serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG) testing at any time, then the sponsor clinician or sponsor medical monitor should be notified immediately. Suicidality Participants triggering criteria for suicidal ideation and behavior as described in Section 8.2.5.1. See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of intervention discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 7.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early termination visit should be conducted. See the SoA for assessments to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. The Early Termination visit applies only to participants who are randomized and then are prematurely withdrawn from the study. Participants should be questioned regarding their reason for withdrawal. The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time. If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any remaining samples, but data already generated from the samples will continue to be available and may be used to protect the integrity of existing analyses. The investigator must document any such requests in the site study records. If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent (see below) for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. When a participant withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported on the Clinical Trial (CT) SAE Report. Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early termination procedures will not be viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant’s safety was preserved. For participants who discontinue early from the Investigational Treatment Period prior to the Week 16 visit, or those who discontinue early from the Extension Treatment Period prior to the Week 40 visit, should perform the procedures scheduled at the Early Termination (ET) visit. See Section 10 for Guidelines for Safety Monitoring and Discontinuations. Withdrawal of Consent: Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study treatment will remain in the study and proceed to ET visit as soon as possible. Whenever possible, these participants should have one visit approximately two weeks after the last dose (Week 20 or 44 Follow up visit assessments) and/or at least 28 days after the last dose of IP was administered. The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. Participants should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of investigational product or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law. 7.3. Lost to Follow-up All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participants to determine and report their ongoing status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized by the participant as noted below. A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study;  Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record;  The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the participant return all unused investigational product(s), request that the participant return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the participant regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs);  Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole is handled as part of Appendix 1. 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and dated ICD before performing any study-specific procedures. Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol-required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the participant. When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for the missed test and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study. The total blood sampling volume for individual participants will be outlined in the Lab Manual. Additional blood samples may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by Sponsor, provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 550 mL during any period of 60 consecutive days. 8.1. Efficacy Assessments Measures of psoriasis efficacy that will be collected throughout the study are outlined in this section. These efficacy measures will be evaluated by an experienced physician, dermatologist, or qualified medical professional and should be performed by the same clinician throughout the study whenever possible. Detailed descriptions for the PGA and patient reported outcomes (PROs) are provided in Appendices 10-17. 8.1.1. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index quantifies the severity of a participant’s psoriasis based on both lesion severity and the percentage of body surface area affected. Lesion severity: the basic characteristics of psoriatic lesions – erythema, induration and scaling – provide a means for assessing the severity of lesions. Assessment of these three main signs is performed separately for four areas of the body: head, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs. Average erythema, induration and scaling are rated for each body area according to a 5-point scale: 0, no involvement; 1, slight; 2, moderate; 3, marked; 4, very marked. Body surface area (BSA) involvement: the extent (%) to which each of the four areas of the body is affected by psoriasis is assigned a numerical score according to the following area scoring criteria: 0, no involvement; 1, >0 to 9%; 2, 10 to 29%; 3, 30 to 49%; 4, 50 to 69%; 5, 70 to 89%; 6, 90 to 100%. Component Scoring Criteria for the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Percent BSA with Psoriasis: the extent (%) to which each of the four body regions is involved with psoriasis is categorized using a non-linear scaling method to a numerical area score according to the following BSA scoring criteria (Table 4). Table 4. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Area Score Criteria Calculating PASI Body Region Weighting: each body region is weighted according to its approximate percentage of the whole body (Table 5). Table 5. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Area Score Criteria In each body region, the sum of the Severity Scores for erythema, induration and scaling is multiplied by the Area Score and by the Body Region Weighting to provide a body region value, which is then summed across all four body regions resulting in a PASI score as described in the following equation: PASI = 0.1Ah(Eh + Ih + Sh) + 0.2Au(Eu + Iu + Su) + 0.3At(Et + It + St) + 0.4Al(El + Il + Sl) where A = Area Score; E = erythema; I =induration; S = scaling; h = head; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 units from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing increasing severity of psoriasis. The PASI score will be used for the primary analysis. Calculation of PASI will be done centrally by sponsor programmers. Linear Method Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (L PASI) A second method of calculating PASI will also be performed. A linear scaling method will be applied to the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index calculation, adapting the classic calculation by using the actual percentage body surface area involved in psoriasis rather than categorizing the percentage involvement on a 7 point scale. The linear scaling method will be calculated from the study database; investigator sites will only perform the classic PASI calculation during the study. The L PASI score will be used for a sensitivity analysis. L-PASI Calculation L-PASI = 0.1(6xBh)x(Eh + Ih + Sh) + 0.2(6Bu)x(Eu + Iu + Su) + 0.3(6xBt)x(Et + It + St) + 0.4(6xBl)x(El + Il + Sl) where B = percentage area of involvement; E = erythema; I =induration; S = scaling; h = head; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs 8.1.2. Physician Global Assessment (PGA) The Physician Global Assessment of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration and scaling are rated separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale, scored from 0 to 4, with appropriate morphologic descriptors. The severity rating scores are summed and the average taken – the total average is rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA (See Appendix 17). The 5-point scale for PGA is: 0, “clear”; 1, “almost clear”; 2, “mild”; 3, “moderate”; 4 “severe” (Table 7). Table 6. Component Scoring Criteria for the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Table 7. Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Score Note: Calculated arithmetic average of individual signs severity scores [(E + I + S)/3] is rounded to the nearest whole number score (eg, if total ≤2.49, score = 2; if total ≥2.50, score = 3). Calculation will be done centrally by sponsor programmers. CCI CCI CCI CCI 8.1.4. Rater Qualifications For specific rating assessments, only qualified raters will be allowed to evaluate and/or rate participants in this study. The minimum qualifications a rater must meet for each study rating assessment will be outlined in the Rater Assessment Manual provided to each participating site. The level of experience with the target population (or equivalent), specific scale experience (or equivalent), and certification required (if applicable) will be listed and used to determine whether a rater is approved for a given assessment. Proposed raters who do not meet specific criteria but who may be qualified based on unique circumstances may be individually reviewed by the study clinical team to determine whether or not a waiver may be issued. The rater must become certified to perform selected study assessments before they can participate in the conduct of the study. For specifically defined assessments, rater training and standardization exercises may be conducted, and written and signed documentation will be provided by the site for each rater’s certification. In return, each site will be provided written and signed documentation outlining each rater’s certification for specific study assessments. Recertification may be required at periodic intervals during the study. The raters who administer specific study assessments will be documented in a centralized location and all site staff who administer ratings will be verified in the site study documentation during the conduct of the study. 8.2. Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns. 8.2.1. Assessments at Screening only 8.2.1.1. Tuberculosis (TB) Testing Participants should be screened for TB using an Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) per local guidelines. IGRA will be tested during screening or within 12 weeks prior to Screening. The following are acceptable IGRA assays: T SPOT® TB test (preferable, where available), QuantiFERON® TB Gold In Tube test (QFT GIT) and QuantiFERON® TB Gold test (QFT G). Site personnel should follow the processing and analyses steps based on the assay chosen. Ensure incubation steps are followed as appropriate. Documentation of IGRA product used and the test result must be in the participant’s source documentation. If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may be repeated once, and if a negative result is obtained, enrollment may proceed. A positive test on repeat is exclusionary. Participants with repeat indeterminate IGRA results may be enrolled after consultation with pulmonary or infectious disease specialist that determines low risk of infection (ie, participant would be acceptable for immunosuppressant (eg, anti-TNF tumor necrosis factor) treatment without additional action). Participants who test positive for QFT-G/QFT-GIT test, but in the opinion of the PI are at low risk of TB infection may be referred to pulmonary or infectious disease specialist for consultation and potential IGRA test repeated once. Participants will be eligible if the repeat test is negative before the randomization. 8.2.1.2. Chest Radiograph Participants must have chest radiograph taken at Screening and read by a qualified radiologist. Documentation of the official reading must be located and available in the source documentation. If chest radiograph has been taken within 12 weeks prior to Day 1 and read by a qualified radiologist as normal, this does not have to be repeated at screening, provided documentation is available. Chest radiograph may include chest x-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral views are recommended, however local guidelines should be followed) or other appropriate diagnostic image (ie, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). Participants with evidence of currently active TB, general infections, heart failure or malignancy will be excluded. Participants with changes suggestive of untreated latent or active TB infection may be enrolled after consultation with a pulmonary or infectious disease specialist who determines a low risk of infection. 8.2.1.3. Medical History Investigators should make all reasonable efforts to obtain an accurate and complete medical history and history of prior medication use when evaluating whether a participant is eligible for the study. The following will be collected at Screening: complete medical history, psoriasis disease history (including disease duration and prior treatments), and alcohol and tobacco use history. If the status of a participant’s medical history is in doubt or information pertaining to a critical variable is conflicting, every reasonable step to secure proper documentation of correct medical status should be attempted. Documentation of the medical and medication histories over the protocol defined time periods should be available for sponsor review during the source data verification process. Questions about prior medications or eligibility should be directed to the sponsor clinician or sponsor medical monitor. 8.2.1.4. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS Appendix 9) is a validated tool to evaluate suicidal ideation and behavior.11 At the screening and baseline visit, if there are “yes” answers on items 4, 5 in the past year, or on any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C-SSRS in the past 5 years, the participant will be excluded from the study. 8.2.2. Assessment During Study 8.2.2.1. Full Physical and Brief Physical Examinations Full physical examinations must be performed by the investigator, sub-investigator, or a qualified healthcare professional per local guidelines. A full physical examination will include assessments of the general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular, respiratory (lung), gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. A brief examination will include assessments of the skin (both psoriasis and non-psoriasis skin) and body systems with any symptoms reported by the study participants. Any clinically significant changes from the most recent physical examination should be recorded as adverse events (AEs). Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. Full and brief physical exams will be performed as specified in Schedule of Activities. 8.2.2.2. Weight and Height It is recommended that weight be measured in kilograms (kg) and that height be measured in centimeters (cm). Height and weight will be measured to one decimal place. For measuring weight, a scale with appropriate range and resolution should be used and must be placed on a stable, flat surface. Participants should remove shoes, bulky layers of clothing, and jackets so that only light clothing remains. 8.2.2.3. Vital Signs (Blood pressure, pulse rate, and temperature) Single sitting blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, and temperature will be measured at times specified in the Schedule of Activities. Additional collection times or changes to collection times will be permitted, as necessary to ensure appropriate collection of safety data. Vital signs should be performed before laboratory blood collection after at least 5 minutes rest. Sitting blood pressure (preferred but not required) will be measured with the participant’s arm supported at the level of the heart and recorded to the nearest mm Hg. It is preferred that the same arm be used throughout the study. The same size BP cuff, which has been properly sized and calibrated, will be used to measure BP each time. The use of automated devices for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable, although, when done manually, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least 30 seconds. When the timing of these measurements coincides with a blood collection, it is preferred that vital signs be obtained prior to the nominal time of blood collection. Body temperature may be collected using tympanic, oral (preferred), or axillary methods and that the same method be used consistently throughout the study. 8.2.3. Electrocardiograms Six singlicate standard 12-Lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the SoA section of this protocol using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures pulse rate (PR), QT, and QTc intervals and QRS complex. All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the participant has rested quietly for at least 10 minutes. Consistent methods across visits is recommended. ECGs should be performed before laboratory blood collection, BP, and pulse rate. To ensure safety of the participants, a qualified individual (eg, sub-investigator) at the investigator site will make comparisons to baseline measurements taken at baseline. A copy of the ECG should be available as source documents for review. ECGs will be read locally during the dosing period. If a postdose QTc interval remains ≥30 msec from the baseline and is >450 msec; or b) an absolute QTc value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG for greater than 4 hours (or sooner, at the discretion of the investigator), or QTc intervals get progressively longer, the participant should undergo continuous ECG monitoring. A cardiologist should be consulted if QTc intervals do not return to less than the criterion listed above after 8 hours of monitoring (or sooner, at the discretion of the investigator). In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads be placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings. If a machine-read QTc value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not be necessary if a qualified medical provider’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable range. ECG values of potential clinical concern are listed in Appendix 7. 8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments See Appendix 2 for the list of clinical safety laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA for the timing and frequency. The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 28 days after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the sponsor notified. All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. If laboratory values from non-protocol-specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the CRF. 8.2.5. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring Participants meeting exclusionary criteria (Section 5.2) for suicidal ideation/behavior will be excluded from study participation. It is recommended the participant’s primary care physician (PCP) is informed if this exclusion criterion is met, and the participant referred to a mental health professional, either by the PCP or the investigator according to their usual practice. 8.2.5.1. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)11 is a validated tool to evaluate suicidal ideation and behavior (Appendix 9). “Lifetime” version will be used at screening and baseline and the “since last visit” version will be used in all subsequent visits. If at any visit, there are “YES” answers on items 4, 5 or on any behavioral question of the C-SSRS, a risk assessment should be done immediately by a qualified medical health practitioner for appropriate evaluation and treatment. If the participant cannot be seen by a mental health professional within 24 hours, then the participant should be sent to a local emergency room for psychiatric assessment. If these answers occurred after IP dosing (ie, post-Day 1), IP will be temporarily discontinued until further evaluation. This evaluation will help determine whether it is safe for the participant to continue to participate in the trial. Participants who answer “YES” on items 4, 5 or on any behavioral question of the C-SSRS on more than one occasion during a trial will be discontinued from the trial. 8.2.6. Herpetiform Rash Surveillance For any occurrence of a suspected herpetiform rash (eg, herpes zoster and herpes simplex), specimens for viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis will be obtained: A swab of the affected area will be collected for confirmation; a blood sample for viral surveillance will be collected for the analysis of viral load. Details for these collections will be provided in the laboratory manual. 8.2.7. Glomerular Filtration Rate Serum creatinine is the best known standard test for monitoring renal function. Serum creatinine will be measured as part of serum chemistry at times specified in the Schedule of Activities section of the protocol. Serum creatinine elevations above the ULN will be followed until resolution or baseline. Serum creatinine based eGFR will be calculated. eGFR will be calculated at corresponding times per Schedule of Activities. The eGFR will be calculated using the equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI).12 8.2.8. Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy tests may be urine or serum tests, as indicated in SoA, but must have a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL. Pregnancy tests will be performed in women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) at the times listed in the SoA. Following a negative pregnancy test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced, and a second negative pregnancy test result will be required at the baseline visit prior the participant’s receiving the investigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected) and at the end of the study. Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded if the 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE and an SAE can be found in Appendix 3. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative). The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or that caused the participant to discontinue the PF-06826647 (see Section 7). In addition, the investigator may be requested by Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow-up information in an expedited fashion. 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days, except as indicated below, after the last administration of the investigational product. For participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form (CRF), not the AE section. Follow-up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. 8.3.1.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. SAEs occurring in a participant after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product must be reported to Pfizer Safety. 8.3.1.2. Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs on the CRF During the active collection period, both nonserious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF. 8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. 8.3.3. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3). In general, follow-up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety. Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 3. 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the investigator’s brochure and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants and, if indicated, female partners of male participants will be collected after the start of study intervention and until at least 5 terminal half-lives or approximately 7 to 11 days after the last dose. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within [24 hours] of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. 8.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. 8.3.6. Medication Errors Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the investigational product by the wrong participant, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Exposures to the investigational product under study may occur in clinical trial settings, such as medication errors. Medication errors include: • Medication errors involving participant exposure to the investigational product; • Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the study participant. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page. In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately. Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, any associated AE(s), serious and nonserious, are recorded on an AE page of the CRF. Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report Form only when associated with an SAE. 8.4. Treatment of Overdose For this study, any dose of PF-06826647 greater than 1600 mg of investigational product within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose. Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 1. Contact the medical monitor immediately. 2. Closely monitor the participant for any AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities until PF-06826647 can no longer be detected systemically (at least 3 days). CCI 4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the CRF. 5. Overdose is reportable to Safety only when associated with an SAE. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. CCI CCI   Unless prohibited by local regulations or IRB/EC decision, participants will be asked to indicate on the consent document whether they will allow their banked samples to also be used to design and conduct research in order to gain a further understanding of other diseases and to advance science, including development of other medicines for patients. This component of the sampling banking is optional for participants; they may still participate in the study even if they do not agree to the additional research on their banked samples. The optional additional research does not require the collection of any further samples. See Appendix 5 for information regarding genetic research. Details on processes for collection and shipment of these samples can be found in the laboratory manual. 8.9. Health Economics Medical resource utilization is not evaluated in this study. However, the study does include the EQ5D-5L, a questionnaire that assesses patient preference for a given health state and which will be utilized for cost-effectiveness/utility modeling. The EQ5D-5L is summarized below in the patient reported outcomes measures section. 8.10. Patient Reported Outcome Measures Every effort should be made for the participant to complete all patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires before any other assessments except at Baseline when eligibility needs to be confirmed. All PROs should be completed in the following order: Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI), Peak-Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS), CCI will be completed as a diary from baseline to Day 15. Post Day 15, these scales will be completed at the site. At site visits participants will complete PROs in the following order: Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI), PP-NRS, CCI The amount of time required for a participant to complete the PRO questionnaires is approximately 10-25 minutes (depending on the visit and associated PROs). Once participants meet all eligibility criteria, they will be provided a handheld device (provided by the sponsor) for the PSI (both 24-hour recall and 7-day recall), PP-NRS, aC CI to be completed at home prior to first dose of the day. . All PROs are to be completed as per the time points defined in the Schedule of Activities. Delegated site staff will oversee the use of electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) devices. Completion of PROs will be monitored for adherence. Delegated site staff will review adherence to all applicable PROs with participants at each visit and counsel as appropriate. If a participant has repeated non-adherence, the participant should be retrained on use of the device. If a participant is unable to complete ePROs due to documented technical issue or disability or other limitation (eg, difficulty with manual dexterity or source of data entry is completed and reviewed by investigational site staff. This may include for example reading the questions verbatim to the participant and entering participant selection of responses by the site staff. 8.10.1. Psoriasis Symptom Inventory The Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (PSI) is a self-administered 8 item questionnaire that measures the severity of psoriasis symptoms over the past 24 hours and the past 7 days (Appendix 10).13 For the first 2 weeks up to Week 2 visit (inclusive), the PSI will be administered daily using a recall period of 24 hours. After Week 2 visit, the PSI will be administered according to the Schedule of Activities using a recall period of past 7 days. The measure includes concepts of itch, pain, burning, stinging, cracking, scaling, flaking, and redness. Participants are asked to respond to each item using a 5-point Likert response scale: 0: not all severe, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe and 4: very severe. PSI should be completed as described in the Schedule of Activities. 8.10.2. Peak-Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale The intensity of pruritus will be assessed by a Peak-Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS), an 11-category numeric rating scale from 0 to 10, which is patient reported (Appendix 11)14,15 Participants will be asked to assess their itch over the past 24 hours, anchored by the terms “no itch” (0) and “worst itch imaginable” (10) at the ends. CCI 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 9.1. Estimands and Statistical Hypotheses 9.1.1. Estimands The primary estimand will be the population average treatment effect on PASI 90 rates at Week 16 relative to placebo without regard to compliance in the absence of prohibited medication. Measurements after the initiation of prohibited medication will be censored and treated as missing data. Missing data due to censoring, study withdrawal or other reasons will have data imputed using a control based multiple imputation strategy assuming these participants no longer receive an efficacy benefit from the IP but rather, have a response similar to participants assigned to placebo. The population based treatment effect will be the differences in the proportions of successes in each treatment arm compared to the corresponding placebo. All other secondary continuous clinical endpoints will be analyzed using estimand E2, while all other key secondary categorical clinical endpoints will be analyzed using the primary estimand E1 as described above. CCI secondary endpoints as a means to examine the robustness of the results and to compare to available literature as needed. Details of these analyses will be presented in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 9.2. Sample Size Determination The primary endpoint in this study is the PASI 90 response rate at Week 16. Assuming a PASI 90 response rate as 5% for the placebo group, and placebo corrected effect 35% or greater for one of the treatment groups, a total of N=128 completers are needed to ensure at least 90% power for the lower doses due to Bonferroni multiplicity adjustment with 1-sided type-I error rate of 5% and 2:1:1:2:2 allocation ratio of placebo, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg. The total sample size includes a sample size of 32 completers per arm for placebo, 200 mg and 400 mg, and 16 completers per arm for 50 mg and 100 mg. Accounting for a 20% chance of drop out, approximately a total of 160 participants will be enrolled in this study. 9.3. Populations for Analysis For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: 9.4. Statistical Analyses The SAP will be developed and finalized before database lock and will describe the participant populations to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. 9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses Other continuous secondary endpoints at time points specified in the Schedule of Activities including; absolute PASI, change from baseline PASI, percent change from baseline PASI, absolute and change from baseline Itch Severity Score, absolute and change from baseline Psoriasis Symptom Inventory will be analyzed as described for the E2 estimand along with descriptive statistics and possibly graphical displays. No adjustments for multiplicity will be made for these endpoints. Other binary secondary endpoints at time points specified in the Schedule of Activities including, PASI 50, PASI 100, PGA of clear or almost clear and proportions of participants achieving a Psoriasis Symptom Inventory Score of 0 or 1 will be analyzed as described for the primary estimand along with descriptive statistics and possibly graphical displays. No adjustments for multiplicity will be made for these endpoints. CCI All endpoints in Extension Treatment Period will be analyzed with descriptive statistics and graphical displays when appropriate. Details of the analyses of the Investigational Treatment Period and Extension Treatment Period will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 9.4.2. Safety Analyses All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population. 9.4.2.1. Electrocardiogram Analyses Changes from baseline for the ECG parameters QT interval, heart rate, QTc interval, PR interval, and QRS complex will be summarized by treatment and time. The number (%) of participants with maximum postdose QTc values and maximum increases from baseline in the following categories will be tabulated by treatment: Safety QTc Assessment In addition, participants with QTcF values >500 msec will be listed. 9.5. Interim Analyses Interim analyses may be performed to assess efficacy and safety after at least 60% of the planned participants, ie, approximately 80 participants, complete their study participation through Week 12. Interim analysis results will be used for internal business decisions regarding future study planning or stopping for futility. Before the interim analysis is instigated, the details of the objectives, decision criteria, dissemination plan and method of maintaining the study blind as per Pfizer’s SOPs will be documented and approved in the internal review committee (IRC) charter. In addition, the analysis details will be documented and approved in an interim analysis SAP or final SAP. 9.5.1. Data Monitoring Committee This study will not use a data monitoring committee (DMC). This study will use an internal review committee (IRC) which will be comprised of internal Pfizer experts, independent of the study team. Members of the study team will not be part of the IRC. An unblinded sponsor statistician or a clinician who is not directly involved with the study will perform the interim analyses and provide the results only to the IRC. No randomization information for individual participants will be reported to the IRC as part of the interim analysis; however, unblinded aggregate results will be reported. The IRC will be responsible for evaluating safety of participants in the study according to the IRC Charter. The recommendations made by the IRC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision. Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. 9.5.2. Safety Adjudication Committees The identification of events requiring submission to an adjudication/review committee may be made by the study site and communicated to Pfizer or designee. Events requiring review, including cardiovascular and venous thromboembolic events may also be identified by the Pfizer study team or designee during the review of subject data listings or by site monitors during routine monitoring of participant’s study records. The Pfizer study team or designee will notify the study site of any events if identified. The Pfizer Study Team or designee will provide a listing of specific documents needed to support event adjudication by the Adjudication/Review Committees. Obtaining and submitting the documentation will be the responsibility of the study site. Event documentation will vary with the event requiring adjudication and may include (but not be limited to): hospital discharge summaries, operative reports, clinic notes, diagnostic tests, pathology reports, autopsy reports and death certificate information, as applicable. CCI 10. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1. Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations 10.1.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and with the following:  Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines;  Applicable International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines;  Applicable laws and regulations, including applicable privacy laws. The protocol, protocol amendments, ICD, investigator’s brochure (IB), and other relevant documents (eg, advertisements) must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor and submitted to an IRB/EC by the investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated. Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB/EC approval before implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants. The investigator will be responsible for the following:  Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the IRB/EC;  Notifying the IRB/EC of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by IRB/EC procedures;  Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to requirements of 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), ICH guidelines, the IRB/EC, European regulation 536/2014 for clinical studies (if applicable), and all other applicable local regulations. 10.1.1.1. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable regulatory authority in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any new information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Sponsor should be informed immediately. In addition, the investigator will inform Sponsor immediately of any urgent safety measures taken by the investigator to protect the study participants against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of. 10.1.2. Financial Disclosure Investigators and subinvestigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study. 10.1.3. Informed Consent Process The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the participant or his/her legally authorized representative and answer all questions regarding the study. Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary. Participants or their legally authorized representative will be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/EC or study center. The investigator must ensure that each study participant is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study, the sharing of data related to the study, and possible risks associated with participation, including the risks associated with the processing of the participant’s personal data. The participant must be informed that his/her personal study-related data will be used by the sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the participant. The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate IRB/EC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. The investigator further must ensure that each study participant is fully informed about his or her right to access and correct his or her personal data and to withdraw consent for the processing of his or her personal data. The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before the participant was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was obtained. The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICD. Participants must be reconsented to the most current version of the ICD(s) during their A copy of the ICD(s) must be provided to the participant or the participant’s legally authorized representative. A participant who is rescreened is required to sign another ICD. CCI 10.1.4. Data Protection All parties will comply with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of participant data. Participants’ personal data will be stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to ensure that only authorized study staff have access. The study site will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of disaster. In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study site shall be responsible for determining whether a personal data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing breach notifications as required by law. To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, participants will be assigned a single, participant-specific numerical code. Any participant records or data sets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the numerical code; participant names will not be transferred. All other identifiable data transferred to the sponsor will be identified by this single, participant-specific code. The study site will maintain a confidential list of participants who participated in the study, linking each participant’s numerical code to his or her actual identity. In case of data transfer, the sponsor will protect the confidentiality of participants’ personal data consistent with the clinical study agreement and applicable privacy laws. 10.1.5. Dissemination of Clinical Study Data Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical study results through posting the results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with applicable local laws/regulations. In addition, Pfizer reports study results outside of the requirements of local laws/regulations pursuant to its standard operating procedures (SOPs). In all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and complete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in www.clinicaltrials.gov Pfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies (conducted in patients) that evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of a product, regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted. US Basic Results are generally submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary completion date (PCD) for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the PCD for studies in pediatric populations. PCD is defined as the date that the final participant was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary outcome, whether the clinical study concluded according to the prespecified protocol or was terminated. EudraCT Pfizer posts European Union (EU) Basic Results on EudraCT for all Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies that are in scope of EU requirements. EU Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the PCD for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the PCD for studies in pediatric populations. www.pfizer.com Pfizer posts public disclosure synopses (CSR synopses in which any data that could be used to identify individual participants have been removed) on www.pfizer.com for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies at the same time the US Basic Results document is posted to www.clinicaltrials.gov. Documents within marketing authorization packages/submissions Pfizer complies with the European Union Policy 0070, the proactive publication of clinical data to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) website. Clinical data, under Phase 1 of this policy, includes clinical overviews, clinical summaries, CSRs, and appendices containing the protocol and protocol amendments, sample CRFs, and statistical methods. Clinical data, under Phase 2 of this policy, includes the publishing of individual participant data. Policy 0070 applies to new marketing authorization applications submitted via the centralized procedure since 01 January 2015 and applications for line extensions and for new indications submitted via the centralized procedure since 01 July 2015. Data Sharing Pfizer provides researchers secure access to patient-level data or full CSRs for the purposes of “bona-fide scientific research” that contribute to the scientific understanding of the disease, target, or compound class. Pfizer will make available data from these trials 24 months after study completion. Patient-level data will be anonymized in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. CSRs will have personally identifiable information redacted. Data requests are considered from qualified researchers with the appropriate competencies to perform the proposed analyses. Research teams must include a biostatistician. Data will not be provided to applicants with significant conflicts of interest, including individuals requesting access for commercial/competitive or legal purposes. 10.1.6. Data Quality Assurance All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the CRF. The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the CRF. The investigator must ensure that the CRFs are securely stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and are password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access by unauthorized third parties. The investigator must permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. This verification may also occur after study completion. It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such as risk management and mitigation strategies and analytical risk-based monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring), are provided in the monitoring plan. The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study, including quality checking of the data. Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Records and documents, including signed ICDs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator for 15 years after study completion unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. The investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securely for as long as they are When participant data are to be deleted, the investigator will ensure that all copies of such data are promptly and irrevocably deleted from all systems. The investigator(s) will notify the sponsor or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with the sponsor or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow the sponsor or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the participant's medical records. The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection findings to the sponsor or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide the sponsor or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. 10.1.7. Source Documents As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study. A CRF is required and should be completed for each included participant. The completed original CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry. In most cases, the source documents are the hospital or the physician participant chart. In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator site and at Pfizer that clearly identifies those data that will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator site. Data reported on the CRF or entered in the electronic CRF (eCRF) that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available. Definition of what constitutes source data can be found in the study monitoring plan. 10.1.8. Study and Site Closure The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time upon notification to the contract research organization (CRO) if requested to do so by the responsible IRB/EC or if such termination is required to protect the health of study participants. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor may include but are not limited to:  Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/EC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines;  Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator;  Discontinuation of further study intervention development. Study termination is also provided for in the clinical study agreement. If there is any conflict between the contract and this protocol, the contract will control as to termination rights. 10.1.9. Publication Policy Pfizer supports the exercise of academic freedom and has no objection to publication by the principal investigator (PI) of the results of the study based on information collected or generated by the PI, whether or not the results are favorable to the Pfizer product. However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or unprotected inventions, the investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity to review any proposed publication or other type of disclosure of the results of the study (collectively, “publication”) before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed. The investigator will provide any publication to Pfizer at least 30 days before it is submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed. If any patent action is required to protect intellectual property rights, the investigator agrees to delay the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days. The investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for any study or Pfizer product related information necessary to the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study results. If the study is part of a multicenter study, the investigator agrees that the first publication is to be a joint publication covering all investigator sites, and that any subsequent publications by the PI will reference that primary publication. However, if a joint manuscript has not been submitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the study at all participating sites, the investigator is free to publish separately, participant to the other requirements of this section. For all publications relating to the study, the institution will comply with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II “Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Publication of study results is also provided for in the clinical study agreement (CSA) between Pfizer and the institution. In this section entitled Publications by Investigators, the defined terms shall have the meanings given to them in the CSA. If there is any conflict between the CSA and any attachments to it, the terms of the CSA control. If there is any conflict between this protocol and the CSA, this protocol will control as to any issue regarding treatment of study participants, and the CSA will control as to all other issues. 10.1.10. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the study team on demand (SToD) system. To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical questions or problems, participants are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, participant numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the participant’s participation in the study. The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The contact number is not intended for use by the participant directly, and if a participant calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site. 10.2. Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory Tests The following safety laboratory tests will be performed at times defined in the SoA section of this protocol. Additional laboratory results may be reported on these samples as a result of the method of analysis or the type of analyzer used by the clinical laboratory; or as derived from calculated values. These additional tests would not require additional collection of blood. Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns. Hematologya Chemistrya Urinalysisa Abbreviations: Abs = absolute; ALT = alanine aminotransferase; aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; β-hCG = beta-human chorionic gonadotropin; BUN = blood urea nitrogen; CO2 = carbon dioxide; FSH = follicle-stimulating hormone; GGT = Gamma Glutamyl Transferase; HBV= hepatitis B virus; HCV= hepatitis C virus; HDL = high density lipoprotein cholesterol; HIV = Human Immunodeficiency Virus; CCI IGRA = Interferon Gamma Release Assay; INR = international normalized ratio; LDL =low density lipoprotein cholesterol; MCH = mean corpuscular hemoglobin; MCHC = mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration; MCV = mean corpuscular volume; CCI PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PPD = purified protein derivative; qual = qualitative; PT = prothrombin time; QFT-G = quantiferon-TB-Gold; RBC = red blood cell; CCI WBC = white blood cell. a. Safety labs include hematology, chemistry and urinalysis. Fasting not required unless lipid panel taken. b. Lipid panel requires fasting (water only) at least 8 hours prior to collection. c. Only if urine dipstick is positive for blood, protein, nitrites, or leukocyte esterase. d. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women. e. TB test must be Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). f. HepB reflex testing only if HBsAg negative but HBcAb positive at Screening. If result of HCVAb is positive, or if Hepatitis C Virus antibody result is indeterminate, then an HCV RNA AMPLIPREP TAQMAN 2.0 will automatically be performed. HBV DNA monitoring may be applicable in Japan. g. Serum/urine pregnancy test for WOCBP. h. In cases of suspected herpetiform rash (eg, suspected herpes zoster and herpes simplex). Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. 10.3. Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting 10.3.1. Definition of AE  Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of participant’s condition.  Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE.  Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital).  Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 10.3.2. Definition of SAE If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). Results in persistent disability/incapacity  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 10.3.3. Recording/Reporting and Follow-up of AEs and/or SAEs Exposure to the None All (and exposure during investigational product pregnancy [EDP] under study during supplemental form for pregnancy or EDP) breastfeeding, and occupational exposure  When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostic reports) related to the event.  The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.  It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to Pfizer Safety in lieu of completion of the CT SAE Report Form/AE/SAE CRF page.  There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by Pfizer Safety. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to Pfizer Safety.  The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories:  Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities.  Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 10.3.4. Reporting of SAEs SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via CT SAE Report Form 10.4. Appendix 4: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy Information 10.4.1. Male Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria No contraception methods are required for male participants in this study, as the calculated safety margin is ≥100-fold between the estimated maternal exposure due to seminal transfer and the NOAEL for serious manifestations of developmental toxicity in nonclinical studies. 10.4.2. Female Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding and at least 1 of the following conditions applies:  Is not a WOCBP (see definitions below in Section 10.4.3). OR  Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is acceptable and highly effective (with a failure rate of <1% per year), with high user dependency, as described below during the intervention period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study intervention, which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate any study intervention(s). In addition, a second effective method of contraception, as described below, must be used (except for sexual abstinence). The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy. 10.4.3. Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP: 1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  Documented hysterectomy;  Documented bilateral salpingectomy; For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry. Note: Documentation for any of the above categories can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the participant’s medical record for the study. 2. Postmenopausal female:  A postmenopausal state is defined as age 60 years or older or no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.  A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy (HRT).  Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 10.4.4. Contraception Methods Highly Effective Methods with Low User Dependency are preferred. (Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly). 1. Implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation*. 2. Intrauterine device (IUD). 3. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)*. 4. Bilateral tubal occlusion. 5. Vasectomized partner:  Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. The spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days. * This requirement may be removed if supported by the outcome of ongoing oral contraceptive PK interaction study (Study C2501005); investigators will be notified and notifications as per local regulatory requirements Highly Effective Methods that are User Dependent One of the acceptable barrier methods (described below) must be used in addition to the highly effective methods that are user dependent except for sexual abstinence. 1. Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  Oral;  Intravaginal;  Transdermal;  Injectable. 2. Progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. 3. Sexual abstinence:  Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Acceptable Contraceptive Barrier Methodsa 1. Male or female condom with or without spermicideb 2. Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide 3. A combination of male condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) a. Considered effective, but not highly effective methods - failure rate of ≥1% per year. Note that periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. b. Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction). Collection of Pregnancy Information For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if:  A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product;  An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).  A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy. If a participant or participant’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the participant’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a participant reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safety using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs follows:  Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;  Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner.  10.6. Appendix 6: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow-up Assessments Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These participants fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal (× ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 × ULN) by several days or weeks. The increase in TBili typically occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 × ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be elevated within the same laboratory sample). In rare instances, by the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Participants who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:  Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value >2 × ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2 × ULN or not available.  For participants with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:  Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller).  Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value by an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × ULN (whichever is smaller). Rises in AST/ALT and TBili separated by more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT and TBili for suspected cases of Hy’s law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology. A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either by itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over-the-counter medications), recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) and collection of serum sample for acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/ALT and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has yet been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology. 10.7.
