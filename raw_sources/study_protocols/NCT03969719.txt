 Document History Document History Amendment 2 11 September 2019 Incorporation of results of C1061016 midazolam drug-drug interaction study to relevant background sections, and based on the results of this study, removal of relevant restrictions of CYP3A4 concomitant medications, given that clinical results indicate PF-06835919 does not induce 3A4 metabolism. Specific changes are as follows: 2.2.1. (Nonclinical Overview) has now been revised to no longer indicate the potential for CYP3A4 induction with PF-06835919. 2.2.2. (Clinical Overview) now makes reference to the C1061016 study, alongside other completed clinical studies. 2.2.3. (Preliminary Pharmacokinetic Results of PF-06835919-Midazolam Drug-Drug Interaction Study [C1061016]) has been added as a new subheading within the Clinical Overview, to provide a summary of the results of this study, including a stable on the effect of PF-06835919 on midazolam pharmacokinetic parameters. 4.3. (Justification for Dose) now states that there is not expected to be any effect of PF-06835919 on the PK of CYP3A4 substrates, and has removed reference to the former concomitant medication restrictions, accordingly. 6.5. (Concomitant Therapy) has been updated to; remove the previous caution of potential altered exposure of lipid-modifying agents that are 3A4 substrates; lift the restrictions on antihypertensive agents that are significantly metabolized by 3A4; remove text in section on Other Prohibited Concomitant Medications which previously stated potential altered exposure of sensitive 3A4 substrates.

Synopsis Since all sites conducting the study will be located in North America, this is considered not applicable (N/A). 1.2. Schema The overall study design is captured below in Figure 1.    2. INTRODUCTION PF-06835919 is a ketohexokinase (KHK) inhibitor that is currently being investigated in participants with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). KHK is an enzyme catalyzing the conversion of fructose and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), the first committed step in fructose metabolism. In humans, Loss-of-function in KHK manifests as Essential Fructosuria, a rare, asymptomatic genetic condition1 that is only recognized by the appearance of fructose in the urine after fructose consumption.2,3 PF-06835919 is a potent, reversible inhibitor of human KHK. In nonclinical experiments, treatment with PF-06835919 reduces the incidence of fructose-induced hepatic steatosis and genetic deletion of KHK protects mice from fructose-induced hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hepatic steatosis (see investigators’ brochure [IB] Section 5). Based on initial experience in short duration clinical trials, inhibition of KHK appears generally safe and well tolerated. In addition, PF-06835919 treatment has shown the potential to reduce liver fat and biomarkers of inflammation (see Section 2.2.2). It is anticipated that inhibition of KHK will decrease hepatic de novo lipogenesis and steatosis, thereby ameliorating the pathogenesis of NAFLD and its progression to NASH. 2.1. Study Rationale The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of PF-06835919 over a 16-week treatment period, as well as the effect of PF-06835919 treatment on liver fat, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and additional pharmacodynamic (PD)/CCI parameters in participants with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 2.2. Background Fructose metabolism, unlike glucose metabolism, is not subject to regulatory feedback inhibition in normal human biology. As a consequence of unrestrained metabolism, fructose rapidly generates a number of reactive and signaling metabolites that contribute to metabolic disease progression. Along with the lack of feedback inhibition, hepatic fructose metabolism has been shown to reduce liver ATP concentrations after a single intravenous (IV) bolus of fructose.4 Depletion of ATP leads to the activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase5 and subsequent increases in uric acid levels that have been shown to directly regulate hepatic lipogenesis through generation of mitochondrial oxidative stress.6 Additionally, preclinical studies have demonstrated that fructose rapidly enriches glycolytic metabolite pools, leading to activation of the Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein (ChREBP), a highly lipogenic transcription factor, that can promote both steatosis and insulin resistance with carbohydrate over-feeding.7 Post-prandial hypertriglyceridemia is observed in both rodents and humans following fructose feeding, as fructose both decreases very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) clearance and promotes de novo lipogenesis.8 aEnxdc eNssAivFeLfDru.8ctIons eh ucomnasnusm, sputipopnl ehmase nbteaetnio snh oofw an n toor cmaauls ed ifeeta wtuirtehs 2 o5f% m oefta tbhoel icca lsoyrniedsr oams e fructose, but not as glucose, caused hyperlipidemia within 2 weeks.9 Additionally, these participants developed insulin resistance as evidenced by increased insulin excursion during an oral glucose tolerance test.9 Increased sugar intake, in the form of carbonated beverages, has been associated with NAFLD in patients who lack other features of metabolic syndrome, suggesting that fructose intake independent of metabolic disease can increase liver fat.10,11 In a separate study with participants consuming weight-neutral diets containing 25% of dietary calories as fructose, increased hepatic lipid and decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity were observed after 9 days of high-fructose consumption.12 Conversely, restricting dietary sugar intake from 28% to 10% for 9 days improved insulin sensitivity and reduced hepatic lipid in obese adolescents.13 In a separate study, fructose at 5%, 8.75%, or 12.5% of the daily caloric intake showed a dose-responsive slight elevation in plasma triglycerides (TG) and elevation in uric acid.14 In studies with matched calories provided as free glucose, fructose was unique in its ability to promote insulin resistance, visceral obesity and hyperlipidemia.9 Collectively, these data suggest that the fructose, not glucose, component of dietary sugar is unique in its ability to promote features of metabolic syndrome, including steatosis, insulin resistance, and obesity. NASH is a clinical and histological subset of NAFLD that is associated with increased all-cause mortality, cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, increased cardiovascular mortality, and increased incidence of both liver-related, and non-liver-related cancers.15 Prevalence of NAFLD is estimated at 30-40% of the US population, while prevalence of NASH is estimated at 3-5% of the United States (US) population.15 Risk factors for NASH include obesity, insulin resistance, T2DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, as manifested by low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated TGs. There are no therapies currently approved for the treatment of NASH, although a growing body of evidence demonstrates the urgent need for such therapies.15 NASH is diagnosed clinically by liver biopsy demonstrating steatosis, inflammation, and cytological ballooning of hepatocytes, often with varying degrees of fibrosis. The clinical progression of NASH involves increasing degrees of fibrosis, with cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma developing in a subset of patients.15 Patients with NASH may be asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, despite having significant disease shown by liver biopsy. More severe NASH is associated with elevated risk for progression to cirrhosis and liver-related mortality. 2.2.1. Nonclinical Overview In exploratory and/or pivotal toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs, testes and ovary (rat), and the cardiovascular (rat, dog) and neuromuscular (dog) systems were identified as primary targets. Adverse findings identified in the pivotal toxicity studies in rats were degeneration of spermatids in seminiferous tubules of testes at ≥100 mg/kg/day (no-observed-adverse-effect level [NOAEL] = 30 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study, 2.8x the predicted human unbound area under the curve over 24 hours (AUC ) at the highest planned 24 clinical dose of 300 mg once daily [QD]), and an increased incidence (relative to controls) of the 6-month study, 0.9x the predicted human unbound AUC24 at the highest planned clinical dose of 300 mg QD). The ovary finding was not observed in shorter term toxicity studies in rats at doses up to 175 mg/kg/day for up to 6 weeks (up to 8.2x the predicted human unbound AUC at the highest planned clinical dose of 300 mg QD). Increases in heart rate and blood 24 pressure were noted at ≥20 mg/kg in safety pharmacology and general toxicology studies in dogs with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 10 mg/kg and a margin of 1.5x the predicted human unbound maximum concentration (C ) at the highest planned clinical dose of max 300 mg QD. No PF-06835919-related arrhythmia or structural injuries to the heart or blood vessels were observed in any of the studies. Tremors were noted in earlier exploratory toxicity studies and in a single dog during the 6-week pivotal study in dogs, ranging from being mild and self-terminating at 50-60 mg/kg to being lasting and severe, with accompanying clinical signs (eg, ataxia, panting, rapid breathing), at doses up to and including a non-tolerated dose of 300 mg/kg. Tremors were seen at exposures representing 4.3-9.1x the predicted human unbound C , but convulsions were not seen at equivalent max exposures in any study. PF-06835919 had an ultraviolet (UV) light absorbance but was negative in the in vitro phototoxicity assay, which indicates that it is not phototoxic and no further photosafety testing is recommended. Although in vitro data indicated that PF-06835919 had the potential to induce CYP3A and CYP2B6 in humans at the highest planned clinical dose (300 mg QD), based on clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) data (see Section 2.2.3), PF-06835919 does not appear to induce CYP3A4 at the highest dose administered in this study (300 mg QD). In addition, PF-06835919 has the potential to inhibit UGT1A1 and UGT1A4. Further, in vitro evaluations suggest that PF-06835919 has a low potential to inhibit intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. The nonclinical safety profile of PF-06835919 has been adequately characterized to support clinical trials of up to 16 weeks. 2.2.2. Clinical Overview As of February 2019, there are 3 completed sponsor-initiated clinical trials that administered PF-06835919 (C1061001, C1061002, and C1061003). Safety and tolerability findings from these studies are summarized below. In addition, a PF-06835919 midazolam DDI study (C1061016) is complete in the clinic and preliminary results are provided below. The safety and tolerability of PF-06835919 has been assessed in 2 Phase 1 studies in healthy adults, C1061001 and C1061002. Across these 2 studies, 78 healthy adult participants (all males) were randomized, 68 (87%) were exposed to at least a single dose of PF-06835919, and 52 of these participants were exposed to repeated doses of PF-06835919. Single oral doses (up to 600 mg) and repeated daily doses (up to 330 mg) were found to be generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of ‘severe’ intensity in the Phase 1 studies, and all of the TEAEs were ‘mild’ in intensity except for 4 ‘moderate’ intensity TEAEs (abdominal pain, rash, and 2 participants with headaches). The most frequently reported adverse event (AE) following multiple dose administration of PF-06835919 in Study C1061002 was headache (see  Median plasma midazolam concentrations were similar following multiple doses of PF-06835919 compared to those observed for midazolam administered alone. Midazolam T values were similar between treatment periods (median T of 0.5 hours). Plasma max max concentrations declined in a monophasic manner with a similar mean terminal half-life (t ) 1/2 observed between the treatments: 5.267 hours for midazolam administered alone and 4.986 hours when administered with multiple doses of PF-06835919. The statistical comparison of plasma concentrations of midazolam administered alone and with multiple doses of PF-06835919 are summarized in Table 1. The adjusted geometric mean for AUC and C were similar, following co-administration with multiple doses of inf max PF-06835919 as compared to midazolam administration alone. The ratio of the adjusted geometric means of midazolam AUC , and C (90% confidence interval [CI]) were inf max 97.55% (79.91%, 119.08%) and 98.92% (76.44%, 128.01%), respectively, following administration of midazolam with multiple doses of PF-06835919, relative to midazolam administered alone. Overall, these results indicate that there is no evidence of a meaningful effect of 300 mg PF-06835919 on CYP3A4. Table 1.

Benefit/Risk Assessment In completed clinical studies, PF-06835919 was determined to be well tolerated and to have an acceptable safety profile. There are no important identified risks for PF-06835919. The important potential risks for PF-06835919 identified in the nonclinical safety studies include ovarian changes, cardiovascular effects, tremors, and spermatid degeneration. In the ovary, an increased incidence (relative to controls) of decreased/absent corpora lutea was observed in female rats during the pivotal 6-month GLP toxicity study at doses similar to the higher dose levels anticipated for use in human studies (see Section 2.2.1). This was considered adverse due to the potential negative effect on the animal’s fertility. However, these effects PF-06835919 in dogs up to 16 weeks. Based on available data, the effect of PF-06835919 on female ovaries and fertility is uncertain. As a precaution, women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) are excluded from this study. Cardiovascular effects relate to an increase in heart rate seen at doses higher than those anticipated for human studies, which were considered non-adverse with no other correlating ECG, clinical or anatomic pathology findings, or impact to overall animal health. Tremors and spermatid degeneration were all observed at exposures higher than those tested in clinical studies. No adverse cardiovascular effects or tremors have been observed in clinical studies to date. Based on Study C1061003, PF-06835919 administered at the 300 mg dose level was shown to reduce liver fat over a 6-week period. There have been no significant adverse clinical trends in laboratory values, vital signs, or changes in ECG parameters. The sponsor considers that the available information about PF-06835919 from the non-clinical and clinical studies completed to date provides a favorable benefit-risk profile and supports the continued investigation of the compound as a potential treatment for NASH with liver fibrosis. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks, and reasonably expected AEs of PF-06835919 may be found in the IB, which is the single reference safety document (SRSD) for this study. 3. OBJECTIVES, ESTIMANDS, AND ENDPOINTS       4.3. Justification for Dose This study is planned as a 3-arm, parallel group study with 2 active PF-06835919 treatment arms (150 mg QD and 300 mg QD) and placebo to evaluate changes in liver fat and HbA1c in participants with elevated liver fat and T2DM. In Study C1061003 where PF-06835919 or placebo was administered to participants with elevated liver fat, 300 mg was found to have been associated with a meaningful decrease in liver fat (approximate 20% reduction) while the lower dose of 75 mg was not significantly different than placebo. Both doses in C1061003 were generally well tolerated. The doses for this study were selected in order to further evaluate the effects of 300 mg (in a different population and for a longer duration) and to determine if a dose between those studied in C1061003 would be associated with meaningful improvement in liver fat and/or other PD markers being evaluated in this study. Notably, based on systems modeling based on data from the multiple ascending dose study in healthy participants (C1061002), KHK inhibition in the liver at the 300 mg dose is expected to be near maximal. With the exception of a decreased/absent corpus lutea finding in the 6-month rat study (note: women of child-bearing potential [WOCBP] are excluded from this study), anticipated unbound exposures of PF-06835919 in this study are expected to provide sufficient margins over findings in the 6-month rat and 16-week dog toxicology studies (see Section 2.2.1). As exposures observed in the C1061002 study were approximately dose proportional, the anticipated exposure at the low dose (150 mg) is approximately half that of the high dose. It is anticipated that the 300 mg dose of PF-06835919 administered in this study will have a similar effect on OATP substrates, as the 280 mg dose administered in Part B of the C1061002 study (see IB) which demonstrated an approximately 1.6-fold increase in atorvastatin AUC. Based on preliminary results of C1061016, PF-06835919 administered at the highest dose in this study (300 mg QD) has approximately no meaningful effect on plasma concentrations of a co-administered sensitive 3A4 substrate (midazolam). Based on these results, CYP3A4 substrates are allowed in this study. Specific concomitant medication exclusions are detailed in Section 6.5. In summary, the 300 mg QD dose selected for this study is intended to fully assess the potential for KHK inhibition to reduce liver fat and HbA1c in adults with NAFLD and T2DM. The 150 mg dose was selected to explore if a dose between those that were previously shown to be effective (300 mg) and not effective (75 mg) in lowering liver fat in a previous 6-week study (C1061003) has potential for further clinical development. 4.4. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including the follow-up call (or visit, if required by investigator). The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit or follow-up phone call of the last participant in the study. 5.

Lifestyle Considerations 5.3.1. Contraception The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the participant, will confirm that the participant has selected an appropriate method of contraception for the individual participant and his partner(s) from the permitted list of contraception methods (see Appendix 4 Section 10.4.4) and will confirm that the participant has been instructed in its consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the SoA, the investigator or designee will inform the participant of the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document the conversation and the participant’s affirmation in the participant’s chart (participants need to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception). In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the participant to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the participant’s partner. 5.3.2. Dietary Restrictions • Participants must abstain from all food and drink (except water) for ≥≥8 hours prior to any blood sample collections for clinical laboratory tests, fasting glucose monitoring, CCI • Water may be consumed as desired (ad libitum); • Blinded IP must be administered every day with the morning meal; • On scheduled outpatient visits to the site, in the morning, from Visit 4 (Day -14) through Visit 12 (Week 16), participants must be instructed to arrive without having morning meal/breakfast, self-administration of the blinded IP, and morning dose of allowed concomitant medication(s), if applicable, for the given day; • At Visit 4 (Day -14) through Visit 12 (Week 16), inclusive, the morning meal will be consumed with above-mentioned medications at the site [with the meal either provided by the site, or the participant provided a voucher (or similar) by the site to purchase the meal before arriving at the site for each visit]. • Each outpatient visit to the imaging facility (for MRI-PDFF) will occur following a fast (water permitted) of ≥4 hours; • For assessment via FibroScan®, visits will occur following a fast (water permitted) of   Similar to MRI-PDFF, each assessment via FibroScan to occur at the same time of day (2 hours) relative to FibroScan assessment completed at Visit 1 (Screen 1). 5.4. Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomly assigned to investigational product. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE. Individuals who were considered screen failures may be rescreened only after a discussion with the sponsor. If rescreened, these participants should be assigned a different participant number from the initial screening. 6. STUDY INTERVENTION Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol. For the purposes of this protocol, the term IP may be used synonymously with study intervention. 6.1. Study Intervention(s) Administered Packaging and Labeling Study intervention will Study intervention will be provided in bottles. be provided in bottles. Each bottle will be Each bottle will be labeled in blinded labeled in blinded fashion as required per fashion as required per country requirement. country requirement. 6.1.1. Administration Participants will swallow the IP whole and will not manipulate or chew the IP prior to swallowing. To maintain the blind, administration of IP will use a strategy so that all participants will receive an equal number of tablets, regardless of which dose they are assigned. Tablets will be active drug (50 mg or 100 mg) or placebo. Participants will take a total of 3 tablets of PF-06835919 and/or placebo at approximately the same time each day and recommended to be taken with the morning meal. Dosing will be witnessed by the investigator site staff at Visit 4, and Visits 6, 7, 8, 9,10, and 12. Participants will be instructed to delay self-administration of IP and concomitant medications on scheduled visit days until they arrive for their outpatient clinic visit, except participants in the sub-study at their Week 14 (Visit 11). At visits when participants report to the imaging center, dosing and breakfast should be delayed until completion of the MRI-PDFF procedure. Participants should be instructed that if they forget to take their morning dose at their usual time, they should take the missed dose as soon as possible on the day it was missed, however, there must be at least an 8-hour interval between the missed dose and the next dose. If the participant remembers missing a dose the next day or later, they should be instructed NOT to take 2 doses in the same day. 6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study interventions received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention, as applicable for temperature-monitored shipments. 2. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study interventions must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated recording) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. At a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations must be documented and available upon request. Data for nonworking days must indicate the minimum and maximum temperature since previously documented for all site storage locations upon return to business. 3. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). All study interventions will be accounted for using an IP accountability form/record. All empty containers should be returned to the site at each visit when drug accountability will be performed. 4. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are provided in the IP manual or other specified location. 5. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded by the storage conditions stated on the product label. 6. Study interventions should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with the labels. 7. Site staff will instruct participants on the proper storage requirements for take-home study intervention. 8. Any excursions from the study intervention label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery along with any actions taken. The site should actively pursue options for returning the study intervention to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Once an excursion is identified, the study intervention must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the study intervention. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the study intervention after the temperature excursion. Use of the study intervention prior to Pfizer approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding the definition of an excursion and information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site in the IP manual. 9. The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused study intervention (eg, at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Pfizer, and all destruction must be adequately documented. Additional details about accountability, storage, destruction, and excursion reporting can be found in the IP manual. 6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing Participants will be assigned a subject identification number using an interactive response technology (IRT) drug management system. The IP will be dispensed using IRT at each visit from Visit 4 (single-blind) to Visit 10 (double-blind), excluding Visits 5 and 11 (Note: Visit 11 applicable only to participants in the substudy). A qualified staff member will dispense the IP via unique container numbers in the bottles provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule. The participant should be instructed to maintain the product in the bottles provided throughout the course of dosing and return the bottles to the site at the next study visit. Dosing instructions will be provided to the sites and individual participants. Upon receipt of the new bottle, the used bottle will be returned. Participants will be instructed to store the study drug at room temperature and out of the reach of small children. 6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 6.3.1. Allocation to Investigational Product Allocation of participants to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an IRT system. The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the participant number. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when IP is being supplied via the IRT system. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the participant number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. IP will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the SoA. Returned IP must not be redispensed to the participants. The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system. 6.3.2. Breaking the Blind The IRT will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s treatment assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a participant’s treatment assignment unless this could delay further management of the participant. If a participant’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and case report form (CRF). The study-specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system. 6.4. Study Intervention Compliance Compliance of single-blind placebo administration during the run-in period will be assessed by pill count on Day 1 (Visit 6) for the purpose of inclusion into the study. Acceptable compliance will be defined as self-administration by the participants of:  90% of the study-supplied blinded placebo taken by the participant during the run-in period (ie, Visit 4 to Visit 5) - only 1 dose is permitted to be missed. Compliance of IP administration will be assessed during the treatment phase of the study by the number of tablets returned by the participants at Visits 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12.  >80% compliance with self-administration of the IP is expected from Day 1 (Visit 6) to Day 112 (Visit 12); investigators must closely monitor non-compliant participants At Visit 4 (run-in), participants will be provided with a dosing diary (or similar) and instructed on how to record each dose taken throughout the study through Visit 12 (Week 16). Participants will bring the dosing diary to each clinic visit to be reviewed by clinic staff. 6.5. Concomitant Therapy All concomitant medications taken during the study must be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration. Attempts must be made to not alter the doses and regimens of chronic background medications after randomization and for the duration of participation in this study. Any changes made to background medications must be communicated to the sponsor’s medical monitor as soon as practically possible, and if agreed, be captured in the CRF. All participants must be questioned about concomitant medication at each outpatient visit to the clinical site. Medications taken before Visit 6 (Day 1) will be documented as prior medications. Medications taken after dosing of double-blind IP at Visit 6 (Day 1) and until the second Follow-up (telephone contact or visit) will be documented as concomitant medications. Medications for Glycemic Control Participants must be on a stable dose of metformin (500 mg /day) starting at 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screen 1) and until Visit 13 (on-site Follow-up). The use of the following classes of agents is not permitted within 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screen 1) and until Visit 13 (on-site Follow-up):  Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone;  Subcutaneously administered agents for glycemic control (eg, insulin, exenatide, liraglutide, pramlintide);  Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin;  Sulfonylureas such as acetohexamide, chlorpropamide, tolazamide, tolbutamine, glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide;  Meglitinide analogues such as repaglinide, nateglinide;  Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, vildagliptin; or   glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose and miglitol. Lipid-modifying Medications Use of background lipid-modifying agent(s) are permitted unless otherwise specified in this protocol. If possible, doses of lipid modifying agents should be stable for 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screen 1) and for the duration of the study. Any changes to dose of lipid modifying agents should be noted on the CRF. Participants are permitted to be on stable doses of the following lipid-modifying agents, starting at 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screen 1) and until Visit 13 (on-site Follow-up), including (but not limited to) the following:  Statins such as atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, and pravastatin;  Ezetimibe.

Antihypertensive Medications Use of background antihypertensive agent(s) is permitted unless otherwise specified in this protocol. For participants that enter the study taking allowable antihypertensive agents, doses should be stable for 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screen 1) and for the duration of the study. Any changes to dose of blood pressure modifying agents should be avoided if possible; however, if any changes occur, they must be noted on the CRF. Other Acceptable Concomitant Medications Any participant on the following list of medications must be on stable doses [ie, 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screen 1) and until Visit 13 (on-site Follow-up), if possible]:  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, indomethacin, meloxicam, and celecoxib.

Rescue Medicine There is no rescue therapy to reverse the AEs observed with PF-06835919; standard medical supportive care must be provided to manage the AEs. 6.6. Dose Modification No dose modifications are permitted in this study. 6.7. Intervention After the End of the Study No intervention will be provided to study participants at the end of the study. 7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue IP. Also, it should be stressed that if the study medication is discontinued for any reason, it is fully anticipated that subjects continue in the study per protocol (Off Drug In Study or ODIS) per treatment policy estimand. Should the ODIS subject withdraw from the study, an Early Termination Visit should be scheduled at the time consent is withdrawn and evaluated for early termination procedures as listed in the SoA. ECG Changes A participant who meets either bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from the study.  QTcF >500 msec;  Change from baseline (CFB): QTcF >60 msec. If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to, changes from baseline in QTcF after enrollment), the investigator or qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study and if any change in participant management is needed. This review of the ECG printed at the time of collection must be documented. Any See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of intervention discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 7.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request (and choose not to continue as an ODIS subject) or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit should be conducted. See the SoA for assessments to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. The early discontinuation visit applies only to participants who are randomized and then are prematurely withdrawn from the study. Participants should be questioned regarding their reason for withdrawal. The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time. If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any remaining samples, but data already generated from the samples will continue to be available, and may be used to protect the integrity of existing analyses. The investigator must document any such requests in the site study records. If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent (see below) for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. When a participant withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported on the Clinical Trial (CT) SAE Report. Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early termination procedures will not be viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant’s safety was preserved. Withdrawal of Consent: Participants who request to discontinue receipt of study treatment will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol-specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. Participants should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of IP or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law. 7.3. Lost to Follow-up A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study;  Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record;  Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole is handled as part of Appendix 1. 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and dated ICD before performing any study-specific procedures. Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICD may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed   section. Identification of such incidental findings during the central review process should not be expected, and the site maintains responsibility for performing a general safety review of all images as per site protocols. 8.2. Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns. 8.2.1. Physical Examinations A complete physical examination will occur at times specified in the SoA and include, at a minimum, assessments of the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Height (at Screen 1 only) and weight will also be measured and recorded. A limited physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen). Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 8.2.1.1. Measurement of Waist Circumference As part of the physical examination at Screen 1 only, waist circumference will be measured using a flexible anthropometric tape and ideally, reporting the measurement in centimeters with accuracy to the nearest 0.1 centimeter. Measurement will be undertaken as follows:  While participant is in a standing position with arms resting comfortably at the side;  Under standard conditions including post-void, with the tape touching the skin (not clothing);  At the end of a normal expiration (when lungs are at their residual capacity). The measurement will consider the following anatomical features as benchmarks:  Circumference of the narrowest part of the torso as viewed from the anterior aspect or;  If the narrowest part of the torso cannot be identified, the measurement must be made of the smallest horizontal circumference in the area between the ribs and the iliac crest. 8.2.2. Body Weight In this study, assessment of body weight will occur at the nominal time points specified in the SoA per the following specifications:  Weight will be recorded using a scale placed on a stable, flat surface;  Same scale, as much as practically possible, will be used with the scale reporting weight in kilograms or pounds, and accuracy to the nearest 0.1 kg (or 0.2 pounds), ie, the device used for this study must be able to distinguish a difference between 68.4 kg and 68.3 kg;  Measurement must be undertaken:  At approximately the same time of the day at each nominal time point;  After the participant has been asked to void (ie, forced void);  Under standard conditions (eg, participants must wear light clothing with content of their pockets emptied or hospital gown and not be wearing shoes or bulky layers of clothing/jackets). 8.2.3. Vital Signs Pulse rate and BP will be assessed in triplicate (2-4 minutes between measurements) at times specified in the SoA section of this protocol per the following specifications:  At Screen 1 (Visit 1) only, the participant’s arm circumference should be measured at the midpoint of the length of the upper arm using a flexible anthropometric tape to select the appropriate cuff to be used throughout the study to measure BP/pulse rate via an automated device using an oscillometric method (not auscultation);  Participants with arm circumference greater than the largest cuff size available at each study site are not eligible.  Seated BP/pulse rate will be measured with the participant’s arm supported at the level of the heart, and recorded to the nearest mmHg, following a rest of 5 minutes;  The same arm (preferably the dominant arm) will be used for BP/pulse rate assessment throughout the study;  Participants should be instructed not to speak during BP/pulse rate measurements. Additional collection times, or changes to collection times of BP/pulse rate will be permitted, as necessary, to ensure appropriate collection of safety data. 8.2.4. Electrocardiograms Standard 12-lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the SoA section of this protocol using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures pulse rate, QT, and QTcF intervals and QRS complex. All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the participant has rested quietly for 10 minutes in a supine position. If a postdose QTcF interval remains ≥30 msec from the baseline and is >450 msec; or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG for greater than 4 hours (or sooner, at the discretion of the investigator), or QTcF intervals get progressively longer, the participant should undergo continuous ECG monitoring. A cardiologist should be consulted if QTcF intervals do not return to less than the criterion listed above after 8 hours of monitoring (or sooner, at the discretion of the investigator). In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads be placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings. If a machine-read QTcF value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not be necessary if a qualified medical provider’s interpretation determines that the QTcF values are in the acceptable range. ECG values of potential clinical concern are listed in Appendix 7. 8.2.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments See Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA for the timing and frequency. The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 28 days after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. If laboratory values from non-protocol-specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the CRF. 8.2.5.1. Management of Glycemic Control Hypoglycemic adverse events (HAEs) and fasting plasma glucose will be routinely monitored during participation in the study. Based on this information, as well as review of the results reported by the central laboratory, an assessment of any symptomatic and asymptomatic occurrence of hypo- or hyper-glycemia must be undertaken. 8.2.5.1.1. Home Glucose Monitoring  To aide in management of their T2DM, all participants will be provided home glucose monitoring supplies including a sponsor-provided glucometer, instructions on the use of the glucometer and accompanying supplies.  Home glucose monitoring logs will be provided to participants for completion at home and brought to each outpatient visit to the site along with the glucometers. Investigators must review the home glucose monitoring logs completed by the participants and the readings stored in the glucometer device at each visit to the site after the run-in visit (Visit 4).  Participants must perform home glucose monitoring at least 3 times weekly following at least an 8- (preferably 10-) hour fast (except water). However, the investigator may recommend more frequent home glucose monitoring if needed.  Less frequent glucose monitoring will NOT be considered a protocol deviation unless the participant fails to monitor his/her glucose for 3 or more consecutive days.  If the participant experiences symptoms of hypoglycemia, home glucose monitoring should be performed, and these symptoms, along with the glucometer measurement, should be captured on the home glucose monitoring log.  If the participant uses his/her own glucometer, and not one provided by the sponsor, a protocol deviation will NOT be recorded provided the investigator is still able to monitor the participant’s daily glucose values according to the criteria stated above. 8.2.5.1.2. Management of Hypoglycemia Any episode of hypoglycemia must be captured on the Hypoglycemia Adverse Event CRF. For the definition of a hypoglycemic episode and severity categorization see Section 8.2.5.1.2.1 below. Participants noted to have a fasting plasma glucose value (during home glucose monitoring) meeting the definition of hypoglycemia must be instructed to repeat the measurement the next day (following at least an 8- (preferably 10-) hour fast, except water). If the second measurement also meets the below definition, participants must be asked to return to the site within 1 to 3 days (following at least an 8- (preferably 10-) hour fast, except water) and have blood collected and sent to the central laboratory for analysis of fasting plasma glucose. 8.2.5.1.2.1. Definition and Severity of Categorization of Hypoglycemic Adverse Event (HAE) Based on review of the participant completed home glucose monitoring log at each site visit, as well as results reported by the central laboratory, the investigator must assess the glucose values as well as any symptoms documented. HAE is defined as 1 of the following: 1. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: An event not accompanied by typical symptoms of HAE but a plasma glucose value of <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) using glucometer (or sponsor-identified central laboratory); 2. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: An event during which typical symptoms of HAE are accompanied with a glucose value of <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) using glucometer (or sponsor-identified central laboratory) and the clinical picture includes prompt resolution with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or intravenous (IV) glucose; 3. Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: An event during which symptoms of HAE are not accompanied by a plasma glucose determination but was presumably caused by a plasma glucose concentration of <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), and the clinical picture includes prompt resolution with food intake, subcutaneous glucagon, or IV glucose. Each episode of HAE must be categorized with respect to severity. In order to characterize the event as severe, all 3 criteria below must be met: 1. The participant was unable to treat him/herself. Neurologic impairment, and not the age of the participant, is the explanation for why the participant could not treat him/herself and required the assistance of another person. 2. The participant exhibited at least one of the following neurological symptoms:  Memory loss;  Confusion;  Uncontrolled behavior;  Irrational behavior;  Unusual difficulty in awakening;  Suspected seizure;  Seizure;  Loss of consciousness. 3. Either:  If blood glucose was measured and was ≤54 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L) using glucometer (or central laboratory); or  If blood glucose was not measured, the clinical manifestations were reversed by oral carbohydrates, subcutaneous glucagon, or intravenous glucose. Events that do not meet all the criteria above for severe HAE are characterized as mild or moderate in severity. Any episode of HAE must be captured on the HAE CRF. 8.2.5.1.3. Management of Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia is defined as the following:  Fasting plasma glucose ≥270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) using glucometer (or central laboratory). After randomization, participants noted to have a fasting plasma glucose value (during home glucose monitoring) meeting the above definition of hyperglycemia must be instructed to repeat the measurement the next day (following at least an 8- (preferably 10-) hour fast, except water). If the second measurement also meets the above definition, participants must be asked to return to the site a day later (following at least an 8- (preferably 10-) hour fast, except water) and have blood collected for fasting plasma glucose (and shipped to the central laboratory for analysis). The investigator should determine if the participant collected the samples after an adequate fasting period; and if the participant is following recommended dietary guidelines. Proper dietary and collected procedures should be reinforced with the participant. If the results from the central laboratory confirm the readings using glucometer, the participant should receive glycemic rescue medication at the discretion of the investigator (see Section 6.5.1). 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE and an SAE can be found in Appendix 3. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative). The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or that caused the participant to discontinue the study (see Section 7). In addition, the investigator may be requested by Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow-up information in an expedited fashion. 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information For participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving IP), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days, except as indicated below. Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF, not the AE section. Follow-up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. 8.3.1.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. SAEs occurring in a participant after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product must be reported to Pfizer Safety. 8.3.1.2. Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs on the CRF During the active collection period, both nonserious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF. 8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. 8.3.3. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3). In general, follow-up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety. Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 3. 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the investigator’s brochure and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the IP under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female partners of male participants will be collected after the start of study intervention and until 28 days after the last dose. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 4. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. 8.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. 8.3.6. Medication Errors Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the IP by the wrong participant, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Exposures to the IP under study may occur in clinical trial settings, such as medication errors. Medication errors include:  Medication errors involving participant exposure to the IP;  Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the study participant. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page. In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately. Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, any associated AE(s), serious and nonserious, are recorded on an AE page of the CRF. Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report Form only when associated with an SAE. 8.4. Treatment of Overdose For this study, any dose of PF-06835919 greater than 600 mg within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose. Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 1. Contact the medical monitor immediately. 2. Closely monitor the participant for any AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities until PF-06835919 can no longer be detected systemically (at least 5 days).     Estimand 1: Estimand 1 is intended to provide a population level estimate of the treatment effect of the IP alone relative to placebo under the scenario of no discontinuation of study intervention, without the potential confounding effects of additional prohibited medications, regardless of the participant’s compliance with the IP dosing. Population: The target population consists of patients with NAFLD and T2DM on stable doses (500 mg/day) of metformin monotherapy. Intercurrent Events: a. Withdrawal from study intervention – All data collected after a participant stops taking study medication will be excluded. b. Prohibited medications – All assessments after a participant receives prohibited medications that would modulate the primary endpoints will be omitted from the analysis. Receiving a medication prohibited due to drug-drug interaction (DDI) risk will not affect this estimand. The list of concomitant medications would be reviewed prior to database lock to determine which would be classed as “prohibited” for this estimand. c. Inadequate compliance – Participants with inadequate compliance will have their primary endpoint measurements used as recorded in the analysis. Population level summary: The population level summary will be the mean difference in change from baseline between PF-06835919 and placebo arms for the endpoint of interest. Estimand 2: Estimand 2 is intended to provide a population level estimate of the treatment effect of the IP alone relative to placebo on liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF and HbA1c at Week 16 without regard to compliance or discontinuation of study drug or administration of prohibited medication. Population:  The target population consists of patients with NAFLD and T2DM on stable doses (500 mg/day) of metformin monotherapy. Intercurrent Events: a. Withdrawal from study intervention – All data collected regardless of a participant’s withdrawal from the study medication will be included in the analysis. b. Prohibited medications – All data collected for a participant regardless of the use of prohibited medications will be used in the analysis. c. Inadequate compliance – Participants with inadequate compliance will have their primary endpoint measurements used as recorded in the analysis. Population level summary: The population level summary will be the mean difference in change from baseline between PF-06835919 and placebo arms for the endpoint of interest. 9.2. Sample Size Determination A sufficient number of participants will be screened to achieve approximately 150 participants randomly assigned to IP and an estimated total of 50 evaluable participants per intervention group. A maximum of approximately 150 participants will be randomly assigned to IP such that approximately 132 evaluable participants complete the study. This assumes an approximate 12% dropout rate resulting in 44 completers per arm. With this sample size, the power to detect a 25% mean reduction in whole liver fat from MRI-PDFF compared to placebo is 98% using a 2-sample t-test and a 2-sided Type I error rate of 0.1. This calculation assumes the pooled standard deviation (SD) of 0.36 in the log-scale (based on an internal study). For the co-primary endpoint of HbA1c, the power to detect a 0.75% mean reduction compared to placebo is 96% using a 2-sample t-test and a 2-sided Type I error rate of 0.1 assuming a pooled SD of 1%. There will not be any adjustment for multiplicity in the assessment of hypotheses for the 2 co-primary endpoints. The number of participants in the sub-study will be recruited based on feasibility. 9.3. Populations for Analysis For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined:     10. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1. Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations 10.1.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and with the following:  Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines;  Applicable International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines;  Applicable laws and regulations, including applicable privacy laws. The protocol, protocol amendments, ICD, investigator’s brochure (IB), and other relevant documents (eg, advertisements) must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor and submitted to an IRB/EC by the investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated. Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB/EC approval before implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants. The investigator will be responsible for the following:  Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the IRB/EC;  Notifying the IRB/EC of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by IRB/EC procedures;  Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to requirements of 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), ICH guidelines, the IRB/EC, European regulation 536/2014 for clinical studies (if applicable), and all other applicable local regulations. 10.1.1.1. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable regulatory authority in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any new information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures taken by the investigator to protect the study participants against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of. 10.1.2. Financial Disclosure Investigators and subinvestigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study. 10.1.3. Informed Consent Process The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the participant or his/her legally authorized representative and answer all questions regarding the study. Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary. Participants or their legally authorized representative will be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/EC or study center. The investigator must ensure that each study participant is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study, the sharing of data related to the study, and possible risks associated with participation, including the risks associated with the processing of the participant’s personal data. The participant must be informed that his/her personal study-related data will be used by the sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the participant. The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate IRB/EC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. The investigator further must ensure that each study participant is fully informed about his or her right to access and correct his or her personal data and to withdraw consent for the processing of his or her personal data. The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before the participant was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was obtained. The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICD. Participants must be reconsented to the most current version of the ICD(s) during their A copy of the ICD(s) must be provided to the participant or the participant’s legally authorized representative. Participants who are rescreened are required to sign a new ICD. The ICD will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory samples for optional exploratory research. The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each participant the objectives of the exploratory research. Participants will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the storage period. A separate signature will be required to document a participant's agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research. Participants who decline to participate in this optional research will not provide this separate signature. 10.1.4. Data Protection All parties will comply with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of participant data. Participants’ personal data will be stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to ensure that only authorized study staff have access. The study site will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of disaster. In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study site shall be responsible for determining whether a personal data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing breach notifications as required by law. To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, participants will be assigned a single, participant-specific numerical code. Any participant records or data sets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the numerical code; participant names will not be transferred. All other identifiable data transferred to the sponsor will be identified by this single, participant-specific code. The study site will maintain a confidential list of participants who participated in the study, linking each participant’s numerical code to his or her actual identity. In case of data transfer, the sponsor will protect the confidentiality of participants’ personal data consistent with the clinical study agreement and applicable privacy laws. 10.1.5. Dissemination of Clinical Study Data Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical study results through posting the results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with applicable local laws/regulations. In addition, Pfizer reports study results outside of the requirements of local laws/regulations pursuant to its standard operating procedures (SOPs). In all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and complete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in www.clinicaltrials.gov Pfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies (conducted in patients) that evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of a product, regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted. US Basic Results are generally submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary completion date (PCD) for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the PCD for studies in pediatric populations. PCD is defined as the date that the final participant was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary outcome, whether the clinical study concluded according to the prespecified protocol or was terminated. EudraCT Pfizer posts European Union (EU) Basic Results on EudraCT for all Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies that are in scope of EU requirements. EU Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the PCD for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the PCD for studies in pediatric populations. www.pfizer.com Pfizer posts public disclosure synopses (CSR synopses in which any data that could be used to identify individual participants have been removed) on www.pfizer.com for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies at the same time the US Basic Results document is posted to www.clinicaltrials.gov. Documents within marketing authorization packages/submissions Pfizer complies with the European Union Policy 0070, the proactive publication of clinical data to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) website. Clinical data, under Phase 1 of this policy, includes clinical overviews, clinical summaries, CSRs, and appendices containing the protocol and protocol amendments, sample CRFs, and statistical methods. Clinical data, under Phase 2 of this policy, includes the publishing of individual participant data. Policy 0070 applies to new marketing authorization applications submitted via the centralized procedure since 01 January 2015 and applications for line extensions and for new indications submitted via the centralized procedure since 01 July 2015. Data Sharing Pfizer provides researchers secure access to patient-level data or full CSRs for the purposes of “bona-fide scientific research” that contribute to the scientific understanding of the disease, target, or compound class. Pfizer will make available data from these trials 24 months after study completion. Patient-level data will be anonymized in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. CSRs will have personally identifiable information redacted. Data requests are considered from qualified researchers with the appropriate competencies to perform the proposed analyses. Research teams must include a biostatistician. Data will not be provided to applicants with significant conflicts of interest, including individuals requesting access for commercial/competitive or legal purposes. 10.1.6. Data Quality Assurance All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the CRF. The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the CRF. The investigator must ensure that the CRFs are securely stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and are password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access by unauthorized third parties. The investigator must permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. This verification may also occur after study completion. It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such as risk management and mitigation strategies and analytical risk-based monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring), are provided in the monitoring plan. The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study, including quality checking of the data. Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Records and documents, including signed ICDs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator for 15 years after study completion unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. The investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securely for as long as they are When participant data are to be deleted, the investigator will ensure that all copies of such data are promptly and irrevocably deleted from all systems. The investigator(s) will notify the sponsor or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with the sponsor or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow the sponsor or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the participant's medical records. The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection findings to the sponsor or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide the sponsor or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. 10.1.7. Source Documents Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator site. Data reported on the CRF or entered in the electronic CRF (eCRF) that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available. Definition of what constitutes source data can be found in the study monitoring plan. 10.1.8. Study and Site Closure The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time upon notification to the contract research organization (CRO) if requested to do so by the responsible IRB/EC or if such termination is required to protect the health of study participants. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor may include but are not limited to:  Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/EC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines;  Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator;  Discontinuation of further study intervention development. Study termination is also provided for in the clinical study agreement. If there is any conflict 10.1.9. Publication Policy The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings by the investigator after publication of the overall study results or 1 year after end of the study (or study termination), whichever comes first. The investigator agrees to refer to the primary publication in any subsequent publications such as secondary manuscripts, and submits all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor 30 days before submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments and the investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for any study- or Pfizer intervention-related information necessary for the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study results. For all publications relating to the study, the investigator will comply with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including those established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of the overall study results covering all investigator sites. In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. Authorship of publications for the overall study results will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements. If publication is addressed in the clinical study agreement, the publication policy set out in this section will not apply. 10.1.10. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the study team on demand (SToD) system. To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical questions or problems, participants are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, participant numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the participant’s participation in the study. The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The contact number is not intended for use by the participant directly, and if a participant calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site.  Laboratory results that could unblind the study will not be reported to investigator sites or other blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded are as follows: HbA1c, insulin, hs-CRP, uric acid, and GGT.      The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated.  The investigator will also consult the investigator’s brochure (IB) and/or product information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor.  The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.  The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by the sponsor. In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.   10.4. Appendix 4: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy Information 10.4.1. Male Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following requirements during the intervention period and for at least 5 days after the last dose of study intervention, which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate study intervention(s):  Refrain from donating sperm. PLUS either:  Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse with a female of childbearing potential as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent. OR  Must agree to use a male condom when engaging in any activity that allows for passage of ejaculate to another person.  In addition to male condom use, a highly effective method of contraception is required for WOCBP partners of male participants (refer to the list of highly effective methods below in Section 10.4.4). 10.4.2. Female Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not a WOCBP (see definitions below in Section 10.4.3). 10.4.3. Woman of Childbearing Potential A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP: 1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  Documented hysterectomy;  Documented bilateral salpingectomy;  Documented bilateral oophorectomy. For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry. Note: Documentation for any of the above categories can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the participant’s medical record for the study. 2. Postmenopausal female:  A postmenopausal state is defined as age 60 years or older or no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.  A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy (HRT).  Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 10.4.4. Contraception Methods Highly Effective Methods The following apply to WOCBP partners of male participants: 1. Implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. 2. Intrauterine device (IUD). 3. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS). 4. Bilateral tubal occlusion. 5. Vasectomized partner: Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. The spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days. 6. Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  Oral;  Intravaginal;  Transdermal;  Injectable. 7. Progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  Oral;  Injectable. 8. Sexual abstinence:  Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Collection of Pregnancy Information For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if:  A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product;  An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).  A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy. If a participant’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the participant’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman to Pfizer Safety using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safety of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs follows:  Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;  Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner.  10.6. Appendix 6: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow-up Assessments Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These participants fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal (× ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 × ULN) by several days or weeks. The increase in TBili typically occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 × ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be elevated within the same laboratory sample). In rare instances, by the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Participants who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:  Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value >2 × ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2 × ULN or not available.  For participants with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:  Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller).  Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value by an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × ULN (whichever is smaller). Rises in AST/ALT and TBili separated by more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT and TBili for suspected cases of Hy’s law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology. A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either by itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over-the-counter medications), recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) and collection of serum sample for acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/ALT and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has yet been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology.
