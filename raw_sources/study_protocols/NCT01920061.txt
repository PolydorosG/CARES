Document History Amendment 4 15 July 2015 The purpose of the amendment was to: Include reference to the generic name for PF-05212384 in the header and protocol title page. Protocol Summary, Study Design, Section 3. Study Design and Section 9.3 Sample Size Determination: • Modify language due to typographical errors that were made when protocol Amendment 3 was implemented. • Add language regarding the Pfizer decision on April 1, 2015 to stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002 clinical trial. The decision is based on the company’s change in prioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety concerns or regulatory interactions. Schedule of Activities, Footnote 17 • Modify tumor assessment schedule for patients that remain on study for >12 cycles from every 6 weeks (±5 days) to every 9 weeks (±5 days) to decrease the burden on the patients and sites while still ensuring adequate monitoring for safety and efficacy. Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23 • Additional language to clarify that collection of archival tissue post announcement of Pfizer’s decision to close Arm A and C is at the discretion of the investigator. In addition, in the event archival tissue is not available, a fresh biopsy is no longer required. Section 4.1 Inclusion Criteria, #4 and Section 6.1. Screening • Added reference to Footnote 23 regarding collection of archival tissue. • Specify that ovarian cancer (OC) patients can be enrolled in Arm B as cisplatin is indicated in OC patients. Section 4.2. Exclusion Criteria, #8 and Section 5.4.1 Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4 • Removed aprepitant from list of exclusionary medications at study entry and on study. The use of “aprepitant” is classified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and is permitted in the event that an alternative anti-emetic cannot be utilized. Section 4.3. Life Style Guidelines • An administrative clarification to include the investigator’s designee per Pfizer’s modified protocol template language. Section 5.2.3.1 PF-05212384 • Added language to allow for the possibility that an infusion could exceed the protocol defined 30 minutes. This is permitted in the event of allergic/infusion reactions, and investigators should institute treatment measures according to best medical and nursing practice and the infusion time can be extended to a maximum of 60 minutes. Section 5.2.4 Medication Errors • Updates made per Pfizer protocol template updates. Section 8 Adverse Event Reporting • Updates made per Pfizer protocol template updates. Section 9.1 Analysis Sets • Text was added to describe how PK samples will be handled when the infusion time exceeds the planned 30 minute infusion time. This text is necessary since the protocol will allow for the infusion to be extended in the event of an infusion related reaction. Section 15.1 Publication of Study Results • Updates made per Pfizer protocol template updates. Appendix 9. Management of Allergic Reactions or Anaphylaxis. • An appendix was added to provide further guidance on management of infusion related reactions. Amendment 3 27 May 2014 The purpose of the amendment was to: • Include additional dose levels to be tested in each study Arm. • Patients who are tolerating treatment at the lower dose levels to escalate to the next highest dose at which safety/tolerability has already been established in the study. • Clarifications were made to pharmacokinetic sampling and treatment tables to include dosing after Cycle 7. • Clarifications were made to eligibility criteria with respect to QT/QTc prolongation. • Modifications were made to the Sample size for each arm due to the addition of dose levels. This amendment incorporates all revisions to date, including amendments made at the request of country health authorities, institutional review board (IRB)/external review board (ERB), etc. PROTOCOL SUMMARY Rationale: Signaling through the (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) PI3K pathway is associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumor agents. This has been described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with varying mechanisms of action including taxanes, and (deoxyribonucleic acid) DNA-damaging agents. In the clinic, activated PI3K pathway in tumors has been correlated with decreased response to therapy and worse clinical outcomes. In addition to resistance to cytotoxic agents, there is also evidence of PI3K signaling affecting sensitivity of cells to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family signaling inhibitors. Specifically, the activation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse outcome in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents. In addition, pre-clinical studies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and have demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse resistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor models. Collectively, these findings suggest that PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors may increase the efficacy of both chemotherapeutic agents which are considered standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of several solid tumors and dacomitinib which has shown clinical activity in several tumor types. Objectives: Original Protocol through Amendment 4 Primary Objective • To assess the safety and tolerability and to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the following combinations in patients with advanced solid tumors: • Arm A: PF-05212384 and docetaxel. • Arm B: PF-05212384 and cisplatin. • Arm C: PF-05212384 and dacomitinib. Secondary Objectives • To evaluate the overall safety profile. • To assess the effects of PF-05212384 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib and vice versa in Arms A, B, and C respectively. • To evaluate possible biomarkers of efficacy (eg, KRAS mutation) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects in paired tumor biopsies (eg, pAkt levels) and serum • To characterize the effects of the combinations on the potential to prolong the QTc interval. • To document anti-tumor activity. Endpoints: Original Protocol through Amendment 4 Primary Endpoint • Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT). Secondary Endpoints • Adverse Events as characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4.03), timing, seriousness and relationship to study therapy. • Laboratory abnormalities as characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE v. 4.03) and timing. • Vital sign abnormalities. • Single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of PF-05212384, and other anti-tumor agents (docetaxel, cisplatin or dacomitinib) alone and together, respectively. • Gene sequence data (eg, PIK3CA, KRAS) and levels of PI3K pathway protein biomarkers (eg, pAkt, PTEN, circulating insulin). • QTc interval. • Objective tumor response, as assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1. Objectives - Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Primary Objective • To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with TNBC. Secondary Objectives • To continue to evaluate the overall safety profile of the combination of PF-05212384 plus cisplatin. • To characterize single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics following intravenous (IV) administration of PF-05212384. • To characterize the effects of the combinations on the potential to prolong the QTc interval. • To evaluate additional anti-tumor activity. • To assess patient reported outcomes (PRO) of global quality of life (QOL) and disease/treatment-related symptoms of advanced breast cancer. (cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44) Endpoints - Safety and Efficacy Expansion in patients with TNBC. Primary Endpoint • Objective response (OR) as assessed by the Investigator using RECIST version 1.1. Secondary Endpoints • Adverse Events as characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE v.4.03), timing, seriousness and relationship to study therapy. • Laboratory abnormalities as characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE v. 4.03) and timing. • Single and multiple dose PK parameters of PF-05212384. • QTc interval. • Clinical Benefit Response (CBR), Duration of Response (DR) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) (as assessed using RECIST version 1.1). • Time to deterioration in global QOL. • Change from baseline in global QOL and disease/treatment-related symptoms. (cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44) Study Design: This is a Phase 1b, three-arm, open-label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of PF-05212384 in combination with anti-tumor agents in sequential cohorts of adult patients with select advanced solid tumors. Successive cohorts of patients will receive selected doses of PF-05212384 in combination with selected doses of chemotherapeutic agents (docetaxel and cisplatin) or dacomitinib in 3 independent arms on an outpatient basis. Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in other (monotherapy) studies, the study will test increasing doses of PF-05212384 in combination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinib in order to select the best dose to administer in the MTD expansion portion of the study. A modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment in Arms A and B. The actual dose selected for the next cohort will take into account the recommended dose by using the adjusted mTPI method as well as safety data other than DLTs. In Arm C in order to evaluate concurrent doses of dacomitinib in combination with two concurrent doses of PF-05212384, a zone-based design will be utilized, which is a modified 3+3 design that potentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time.35 In all arms, dose escalation will proceed until an MTD (or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Dose is reached. On April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. has decided to stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002 clinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to enter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those combinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design, assessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of patients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for Arm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in prioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory interactions. For Arm B, the study was originally designed as a dose escalation study with no expansion cohorts. However, Protocol Amendment 5 includes the rationale and description for the safety and efficacy expansion with PF-05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with metastatic or locally-recurrent/advanced TNBC. A total of 21 patients were enrolled in Arm A, 33 in Arm B and 33 patients in Arm C. Approximately 124 patients are expected overall including the safety and efficacy expansion. Pharmacodynamic studies will be performed in paired tumor biopsies, when clinically feasible, to evaluate PI3K and mTOR pathway inhibition at the PF-05212384 doses used in the MTD. Paired biopsies that are obtained during dose escalation and expansion will also be evaluated for modulation of PI3K signaling. Each of the treatment arms are restricted to patients with tumor types for which the combination partner is either considered standard-of-care, or in the case of dacomitinib, are indications which have been shown to be sensitive. Figure 1. Original Overall Study Design OC CRPC: Castrate resistant prostate cancer; NSCLC: Non-small cell lung cancer; ABC: Advanced breast cancer; TCC: Transitional cell cancer; TNBC: Triple negative breast cancer; OC: ovarian cancer; HNSCC: Head and neck squamous cell cancer; BC: Breast cancer Figure 2. Amendment 5 Study Design To understand the single-dose safety and single dose PK of the study drug, a lead in period will be included. A single lead-in dose of PF-05212384 will be given either 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arms A and B) or 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arm C). The lead in period duration, subsequent doses, regimens and PK time-points may be modified based on the PK profile observed during the lead in period. Patients will then receive study treatment on an outpatient basis as 21 day cycles. Treatment with study drug will continue until progression of disease, uncontrollable toxicity, a decision by the patient or Investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study is terminated. Patients experiencing toxicity may be managed with dose modification or discontinuation. If a patient discontinues PF-05212384 or the combination partner (cisplatin, docetaxel or dacomitinib) due to toxicity which is specific to either agent, continuation of patient treatment within the study with single agent PF-05212384, cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis. Statistical Method: The MTD estimation in Arms A and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose assignment criteria based on observed DLT rate. The mTPI method is a Bayesian method with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity increases as dose increases. For Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation. This is a 3+3 design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The expansion portion of the study with cisplatin in combination with PF-05212384 in patients with metastatic or locally-recurrent TNBC will assess safety and efficacy in 2 separate groups of 15 patients, for a total of at least 30 patients. noitces ludehcs uqer lloF pU X X X stnemssessa STNEMSSESSA yam rotagitsevnI ro snoitaulave eht ehT ot refeR .locotorp tcudnoc .serudecorp eht ot redro

Indication – Original Protocol through Amendment 4 PF-05212384 in combination with other anti-tumor agents (docetaxel, cisplatin, and dacomitinib) is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor being developed for use in adult patients with advanced solid tumors. 1.2. Indication – Amendment 5 PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin is being developed for use in adult woman with metastatic or locally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC) in first- through third-lines of therapy. 1.3. Background 1.3.1. PI3K/mTOR PI3Ks constitute a lipid kinase family involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal organization, and glucose transport.1 PI3K enzymes catalyze the formation of the second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), which activates many target proteins, most notably phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). The downstream targets of these protein kinases, such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD) and forkhead box O proteins (FOXOs), mediate most of the proliferation, growth and survival signaling from PI3Ks (Figure 3).2,3 Activation of the PI3K pathway has been implicated in a wide variety of human cancers. Mutations in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of PI3K, are very common in human cancers, having been observed in prostate, and colorectal tumors, among others. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion, leading to activation of Akt has been observed in many types of malignancies including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and glioma.4 Figure 3. PI3K/mTOR and EGFR Signaling Pathways Inhibitors of mTOR are in development for the treatment of cancers, most of these agents are analogs of rapamycin, which specifically inhibit the activity of the TORC1 complex.5,6 Analogs of rapamycin such as CCI-779 (temsirolimus) and RAD-001 (everolimus) have been shown to provide benefit to patients for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. However, specific inhibition of TORC1 results in a feedback stimulation of Akt and thus inhibition of TORC1 alone may be inferior to inhibition of PI3K and both TORC complexes.7 The role of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family members HER-1 (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)), HER-2 (neu/c-erb-2), and HER-3 in many cancer types is well documented. One or more of the members of this receptor family are expressed in over 90% of solid tumors and approximately 60% of those tumors possess abnormalities in this family that potentially contribute to their neoplastic phenotype.8,9 Over-expression of the HER-2 gene is associated with aggressive neoplastic phenotype and reduced survival in patients with breast cancer. Over-expression of HER-2 has also been correlated with poor prognosis and sensitivity to the anti-HER-2 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, in patients with other tumor types including lung, gastric, ovarian, and colorectal carcinomas. EGFR over-expression or aberrant function has been widely noted in lung, renal, prostate, breast, head and neck, colorectal, and other malignancies.10,11,12 The level of EGFR expression appears to be one factor affecting tumor proliferation, invasiveness, and angiogenesis, and relates adversely to prognosis. In addition, EGFR mutations have been identified which appear to drive tumorigenesis and which determine sensitivity to EGFR targeted agents such as gefitinib.13,14 HER family members are considered clinically validated targets based on successful development of both biologics and small molecule inhibitors including trastuzumab, lapatanib, erlotinib, cetuximab, and panitumumab. The PI3K pathway is associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumor agents. This has been described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with varying mechanisms of action including taxanes and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-damaging agents.15,16 In the clinic, activated PI3K in tumors has been correlated with decreased response to therapy and worse clinical outcomes.17,18,19 In addition to resistance to cytotoxic agents, there is also evidence of PI3K signaling affecting sensitivity of cells to EGF signaling inhibitors. Specifically, the activation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse outcome in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents.18 Finally, pre-clinical studies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and have demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse resistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor models.20 1.3.2. PF-05212384 PF-05212384 is an ATP-competitive, pan class I PI3K inhibitor, with an IC of 0.4 nM 50 against PI3Kα and against mTOR with antiproliferative activity in culture and anti-tumor activity in xenograft models. It is intended to be dosed once weekly by intravenous (IV) infusion. 1.3.2.1. Preclinical Data for PF-05212384 PF-05212384 has been shown to cause tumor growth inhibition as well as tumor regressions in a variety of human xenograft tumor models (Table 1). In vivo biomarker studies demonstrated that PF-05212384 suppressed PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling as evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of AKT. These studies were done in MDA361 (human breast) tumor xenografts propagated in nude mice. In this model, pAKT at position T308 was suppressed for 8 hours with PF-05212384 at a dose of 25 mg/kg. Additionally, increased cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), a marker for apoptosis, was observed which correlated with the tumor regression. Table 1. Tumor Growth Inhibition with Single Agent PF-05212384 1.3.3. PF-05212384 Clinical Experience PF-05212384 has been evaluated in one completed Phase 1 clinical trial in adult patients with solid cancer, and is being evaluated in two ongoing clinical trials (one Phase 1b study in combination with irinotecan, and one Phase 2 study in endometrial cancer as single agent). 1.3.3.1. Phase 1 Study of PF-05212384 Single Agent in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors (B2151001) The first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 trial, B2151001 evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single agent PF-05212384 in patients with advanced solid tumors. PF-05212384 doses ranging from 10 mg to 319 mg weekly were administered to a total of 77 patients using a continuous reassessment method (CRM) to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD was decared to be 154 mg, a dose level at which patients received a median number of 7 weekly doses (range 1-24). In general treatment with single agent PF-05212384 was well tolerated over multiple cycles of treatment. Table 2 includes the number of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occurred during the active treatment phase with PF-05212384. Most DLTs occurred at dose levels above the MTD. Treatment-related adverse events are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The most common treatment-related AEs at the MTD (154 mg) were mucosal inflammation and nausea, which were reported in nearly half of the patients (42.9% and 40.5%, respectively), followed by hyperglycemia (26.2%), vomiting (23.8%), and asthenia, decreased appetite, and fatigue (21.4% each). Dysgeusia (19.0%), AST increase, and diarrhea (14.3% each) were also frequent adverse events associated with treatment with PF-05212384. To be noted, although hyperglycemia was reported as an AE in 26.2% of patients at the MTD, the chemistry data showed hyperglycemia in 78.6% of patients treated at the MTD of PF-05212384, although mainly of Grades 1 and 2 (71.4% of all patients treated at the MTD); 3 (7.1%) patients had Grade 3 hyperglycemia. Three patients discontinued treatment with PF-05212384 due to treatment related adverse events (one patient with increased ALT at the 319 mg dose level, and two patients with mucositis at the 222 mg and 319 mg dose levels, respectively).

Abbreviations: AEs = adverse events, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, N = Total number of patients, n = number of patients meeting prespecified criteria Analysis of plasma samples taken after IV administration indicated that PF-05212384 is eliminated with a half-life of 40-65 hours at the highest dose. While the data appeared to indicate that the half life increased with dose, it is considered that this finding was likely to be an artifact of poor assay sensitivity at lower doses. The estimated half life is similar across doses from 89 to 319 mg weekly. Clearance of PF-05212384 is linear with dose, and distribution is relatively high. Plasma concentrations of PF-05212384 exceeded the 50% of maximal inhibition (IC50) of PI3K and mTOR dependent phosphorylation events for approximately 70 hours at doses of 89 and 154 mg, and for ≥120 hours at the 266 mg and 319 mg dose. The target concentration was based on projected human plasma concentration from xenograft models where analysis of xenograft tumor tissue showed a greater than 50% suppression of pAKT and an induction of cleaved PARP, an indicator of cellular commitment to apoptosis. To date, partial responses (PR) have been observed in 2 patients (NSCLC with liver and lung metastases [n=1] and granular cellular tumor of the ovary with peritoneal and pleural metastases [n=1]) and 19 patients have experienced stable disease (SD), with 6 experiencing SD >6 months. 1.3.3.2. Phase 1 Study of PF-05212384 in Combination with Irinotecan in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors (B1271002) A Phase 1b study is ongoing which includes the assessment of escalating doses of PF-05212384 in combination with irinotecan (180 mg/m2) every 2 weeks of 28-day cycles. To-date, 13 patients have been treated with PF-05212384 at doses of 95 mg/week (n=3), 110 mg/week (n=6), and 130 mg/week (n=4). Two patients out of 4 experienced dose-limiting toxicities, Grade 4 febrile neutropenia (n=1) and Grade 3 fatigue (n=1), while receiving 130 mg/week of P-05212384 plus irinotecan 180 mg/m2 every 2 weeks. Based on these findings, the MTD for PF-05212384 when combined with irinotecan 180 mg/m2 every 2 weeks has been determined to be 110 mg/week. The most common treatment-related AEs reported in the 6 patients treated at the MTD include nausea in 3 patients and alopecia, diarrhea, proteinuria, maculopapular rash and vomiting in 2 patients each. All of the events were Grade 1-2. One patient with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), previously treated with irinotecan, was treated at the PF-05212384 95 mg/week dose cohort and experienced a PR (of 6 cycles in duration). A second patient with CRC previously treated with irinotecan experienced 10% tumor shrinkage and remained on study for 6 months. One patient with pancreatic cancer had tumor shrinkage of 5% and remained on study treatment for 4 months, and one patient with pancreatic cancer had tumor shrinkage of 27% and SD for a duration of 9 cycles. 1.3.3.3. Phase 2 Study of PF-05212384 Single Agent in Patients with Advanced Endometrial Cancer (B1271004) Single agent PF-05212384 is currently being evaluated in patients with advanced endometrial cancer in Phase 2 study B1271004. PF-05212384 is being administered at the MTD dose of 154 mg/week. As of February 5, 2013, 20 patients have been randomized to the PF-05212384 arm of the study. Four patients have achieved clinical benefit as defined by lack of disease progression in first 16 weeks. The preliminary safety profile of PF-05212384 Complete information for this compound may be found in the Single Reference Study Document (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.3.4. Docetaxel Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane whose mechanism of action is to promote tubulin assembly in microtubules and to inhibit their depolymerization which causes cells to arrest in mitosis and eventually undergo apoptosis. Docetaxel is effective in a wide variety of solid tumors and is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with breast, lung, hormone-refractory prostate, gastric, and head and neck tumors. Docetaxel doses range from 60-100 mg/m2 depending on the indication and are administered as an infusion every three weeks. Notable toxicities include fluid retention and hypersensitivity reactions.15 Premedication is required to minimize these adverse event and typically consists of dexamethasone 8 mg twice a day (bid) given for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administration. Docetaxel is most commonly associated with myelosuppression and gastrointestinal adverse events. In vitro drug interaction studies revealed that docetaxel is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme and its metabolism may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Docetaxel is primarily eliminated by fecal excretion. Complete information for docetaxel may be found in the SRSD, which for this study is the European Union (EU) European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Taxotere®. 1.3.5. Cisplatin Cisplatin reacts in vivo by binding to and causing crosslinking of DNA, ultimately triggering apoptosis. It is used widely as a single agent or in combination with other agents to treat various types of cancer including testicular, bladder, small cell lung, ovarian, and TNBC. Cisplatin doses range from 50-100 mg/m2 administered IV every 3-4 weeks. In order to mitigate nephrotoxic risks, pre- and post-dose hydration is often used as described in the product label. Notable toxicities include renal insufficiency, myelosuppresion, nausea and vomiting. Due to its unique chemical structure, the chlorine atoms of cisplatin are more subject to chemical displacement reactions by nucleophiles, such as water or sulfhydryl groups, than to enzyme-catalyzed metabolism. Cisplatin is not metabolized hepatically. Cisplatin is excreted through the urine. Complete information for cisplatin may be found in the SRSD, which for this study is the United Kingdom (UK) approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) from Hospira UK Ltd. 1.3.5.1. PF-05212384 Plus Cisplatin in Patients with TNBC The rationale for combining cisplatin with PF-05212384 in patients with metastatic or locally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC) is two-fold: First, there is amplified genomic instability of TNBC tumor cells, leading to an increased vulnerability of TNBC to DNA-damaging agents, such as cisplatin. TNBC tumor cells harbor activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene, making these cells excellent targets for inhibition of the PI3K pathway using pathway inhibitors, such as PF-05212384.46 In addition, some fraction of TNBC tumor cells (~20%) harbor mutations in the DNA repair genes breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2), suggesting a functional deficit in the process of homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA. The inability to repair DNA efficiently makes these cells particularly susceptible to the DNA cross-link strand breaks caused by platinating agents, like cisplatin.40,46 The use of cisplatin in combination regimens in patients with TNBC has shown improved rates of tumor response in both the neoadjuvant and metastatic setting.40,50 As such, recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN) guidelines for treatment of metastatic TNBC have included platinum salts, such as cisplatin.51 The above information provides a sound rationale for combining PF-05212384 with cisplatin in the treatment of patients with metastatic TNBC. 1.3.6. Dacomitinib (PF-00299804) The investigational agent dacomitinib is an orally available, selective ATP-competitive irreversible small-molecule inhibitor of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER, erbB) family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). This family of RTKs includes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, HER-1), HER-2 receptor (erbB2), and HER-4 (erbB4) receptor and their oncogenic variants (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletion, EGFR L858R point mutation, and EGFR T790M mutation). Dacomitinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the HER family through binding at the adenose triphosphate (ATP) binding site, which results in covalent modification of a cystine in the ATP binding pocket. HER-1 and -2 receptor mutations and amplification have been investigated as possible favorable predictors of clinical efficacy and, in particular, it has been shown that patients with certain mutations of EGFR (exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations) have significant benefit from EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). Dacomitinib is being developed for patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Dacomitinib given orally without food in the FIH dose escalation study, A7471001, was absorbed with a median time to the maximum observed concentration (T ) ranging from max 4 to 24 hours. There was no evidence of a clinically relevant effect of antacid administration on C and AUC (defined as area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time max inf zero to infinity time) of dacomitinib. In general, the mean C and AUC of PF-00299894 max increased with dose at the dose range evaluated. After continuous once daily oral dose (QD) for 14-days, the mean AUC accumulation of dacomitinib ranged from 4.39 to 6.18-fold, suggesting a long t½. Inter-patient variability in PK exposure parameters varied from 14-65%. There was no evidence of increasing trough concentrations with time when examining available predose concentrations on Cycle 2 Day 1, 8, and 14 in a limited number of patients (n=2-4) at 45 mg. To date, the terminal t has been characterized in patients at ½ 45 mg, and ranged from 75 to 110 hour with a mean of approximately 85 hours. Dacomitinib is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and an active metabolite, PF-05199265, is formed. Dacomitinib also inhibits the CYP2D6 metabolic pathway. Collectively results from clinical studies suggest that dacomitinib may increase exposure of other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and therefore administration of drugs which are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism may require dose adjustment, or substitution with an alternative medication. Dacomitinib is mainly eliminated by fecal excretion. Dacomitinib is currently in Phase 3 development in advanced NSCLC. As of 16 May 2012, 1503 patients with advanced cancer have been enrolled and treated in 13 clinical trials evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of dacomitinib. Of these 1503 patients, 579 patients were administered dacomitinib as single agent, 466 patients received either dacomitinib or placebo as double-blinded therapy, 293 patients received either dacomitinib or erlotinib as double-blinded therapy, 71 patients received dacomitinib in combination with CP-751,871 (figitumumab). Patients have also been treated with dacomitinib in combination with crizotinib. Complete information for dacomitinib may be found in the SRSD, which for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). Overall, the adverse events associated with dacomitinib single agent have been considered manageable, reversible, and consistent with class-effects associated with EGFR TKIs. Table 5 provides a summary of the most common treatment-related AEs reported for single agent dacomitinib (all patients, all doses, all grades). Table 5. Summary of Treatment-Related Adverse Events in ≥≥10% of Patients Treated with Single-Agent Dacomitinib Table 6 provides a summary of the most common treatment-related AEs reported following treatment with dacomitinib at 45 mg QD in patients with advanced NSCLC. Table 6. Summary of Treatment Related Adverse Events in ≥≥10% of Patients with NSCLC Treated with Dacomitinib at a Dose of 45 mg QD 1.3.7. Study Rationale Signaling through the PI3K pathway is associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumor agents. This has been described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with varying mechanisms of action including taxanes, and DNA-damaging agents.22,23 In the clinic, activated PI3K pathway in tumors has been correlated with decreased response to therapy and worse clinical outcomes.18,19 In addition to resistance to cytotoxic agents, there is also evidence of PI3K signaling affecting sensitivity of cells to EGF receptor family signaling inhibitors. Specifically, the activation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse outcome in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents.24 In addition, pre-clinical studies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and NSCLC cells and have demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse resistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor models.20 Collectively, these findings suggest that PI3K/mTOR inhibitors may increase the efficacy of both chemotherapeutic agents which are considered standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of several solid tumors and dacomitinib which has shown clinical activity in several tumor types. 1.3.7.1. Rationale for Combinations 1.3.7.1.1. Docetaxel Docetaxel is a microtubule inhibitor which is active in a number of human solid tumors. In pre-clinical in vitro studies, the combination of docetaxel and a PI3K inhibitor resulted in additive and even synergistic activity in a variety of human cancer cell lines. In vivo experiments revealed enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with the combination.16 Non-clinical experiments in human NSCLC H1975 and H1650 xenograft models have demonstrated that the combination of PF-05212384 and docetaxel is more effective than either drug alone (Figure 4). Finally, patients with tumors with activated PI3K/Akt signaling have been shown to be less responsive to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents including docetaxel and paclitaxel.17,18 The pre-clinical findings together with the clinical observations, suggest that the addition of PF-05212384 to docetaxel may lead to enhanced antitumor effects in patients. Figure 4.

Cisplatin Cisplatin is an alkylating agent which cross-links DNA. Preclinically, the combination of PI3K inhibitor and cisplatin resulted in synergistic anti-tumor activity in human ovarian cancer cell models.15 Furthermore, the combination of PF-05212384 and cisplatin demonstrated increased anti-tumor efficacy in a breast PDX xenograft model (PJC10). Since single-agent cisplatin is active in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) the combination of PF-05212384 and cisplatin may be an extremely effective regimen in an area of great medical need.24 Cisplatin is also used in combination with gemcitabine in a number of tumor types such as urothelial transitional cell cancers (TCC), NSCLC, and biliary tract tumors and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in ovarian cancer (OC). Thus, based on the preclinical evidence of additive or synergistic activity, once the clinical safety and tolerability of the combination of PF-05212384 and cisplatin has been established, it may be possible to consider replacing gemcitabine with PF-05212384 in these regimens. 1.3.7.1.3. Dacomitinib EGFR and HER2 are important mediators of tumorogenesis in a number of tumors and PI3K is a critical EGFR-dependent effector of downstream signaling. Activation of the PI3K pathway has been shown to be associated with resistance to HER2 inhibition. This is supported by the observation that in patients with HER2+ gastric cancer, activated PI3K signaling predicts for a worse clinical outcome.25 Further evidence of cross-talk between the EGFR and PI3K pathways exists in glioblastoma and NSCLC models.20,26 In a preclinical NSCLC model, the addition of a PI3K inhibitor to gefitinib was shown to overcome resistance to gefitinib.20 Finally, in the H1975 lung xenograft model, tumor growth inhibition was observed for the combination of PF-05212384 with neratinib, a EGFR and HER2 inhibitor suggesting that the combination with the pan-HER inhibitor dacomitinib might also be beneficial (Figure 5).27 Figure 5. Tumor Growth Inhibition of PF-05212384 in Combination with HKI-272 (irreversible Her2 inhibitor) in H1975 Lung Xenograft Model These data support the evaluation of the combination of PF-05212384 and dacomitinib. 1.3.7.2. Rationale for PF-05212384 Doses In Phase 1 study B2151001, single agent PF-05212384 at doses ranging from 10 mg to 319 mg weekly (QW) were evaluated in 77 patients with advanced solid tumors. The MTD was identified as 154 mg QW. In study B1271002, PF-05212384 doses of 95, 110, and 130 mg/week were evaluated in combination with irinotecan 180 mg/m2 every 2 weeks; the MTD of PF-05212384 was 110 mg/week when dosed in combination with irinotecan. In the current trial, the PF-05212384 starting dose in all 3 treatment arms will be 90 mg/week which is 58% of the MTD for single agent PF-05212384 and slightly lower than the lowest dose evaluated in Phase 2 study B1271002 investigating PF-05212384 in combination with irinotecan. In the Phase 1 FIH trial (B2151001), PF-05212384 dose of 89 mg/week (n=4) was found to result in drug concentrations above the target concentration for approximately 70 hours. 1.3.7.3. Rationale for Docetaxel, Cisplatin and Dacomitinib Starting Doses In Arm A, the starting dose of docetaxel will be 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. This is the dose recommended in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide for breast cancer, in combination with prednisone in hormone refractory prostate cancer, and as single agent in NSCLC.28 In Arm B, the starting dose of cisplatin will be 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks which is the dose often used when it is administered as an every 3 week regimen in combination with docetaxel, gemcitabine, or pemetrexed.29,30,31 In Arm C, the starting dose of dacomitinib will be 30 mg which is 67% of the MTD for single agent dacomitinib when administered orally once daily on a continuous dosing schedule. This starting dose was selected given the potential for overlapping toxicity with PF-05212384, such as mucositis and rash. In the dacomitinib FIH trial in patients with advanced tumors, among 111 patients treated in dose-escalation, 13 were treated at the 30 mg/day dose level. One DLT (mucositis) was observed in this group. The safety profile in the specific dose levels was not reported.32 As described in the IB, the 30 mg dose has only been evaluated in a small number patients in subsequent trials however the 30 mg dose is generally better tolerated than the 45 mg dose. During the course of the trial, dose reductions for each combination will be permitted in individual patients who cannot tolerate the starting dose (Section 5.2.5). 1.4. Overall Risk Benefit Assessment Pfizer considers that the results of the nonclinical toxicity and safety pharmacology studies, together with the clinical experience obtained to date with PF-05212384 support the continued development of PF-05212384 in combination with other anti-tumor agents. The tumor types in which these combinations will likely be used, all represent areas of high medical need. 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 2.1.

STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 1b, three-arm, open-label, multi-center, multiple dose, dose escalation, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of PF-05212384 in combination with anti-tumor agents in sequential cohorts of adult patients with select advanced solid tumors. Successive cohorts of patients will receive selected doses of PF-05212384 in combination with selected doses of chemotherapeutic agents or dacomitinib in 3 independent arms on an outpatient basis. Based on the tolerability of PF-05212384 at higher doses in other (monotherapy) studies, the study will test increasing doses of PF-05212384 in combination with docetaxel, cisplatin, and/or dacomitinib in order to select the best dose to administer in the MTD expansion portion of the study. A modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment in Arms A and B.33,34 The actual dose selected for the next cohort will take into account the recommended dose by using the adjusted mTPI method as well as safety data other than DLTs. In Arm C in order to evaluate concurrent doses of dacomitinib in combination with two concurrent doses of PF-05212384, a zone-based design will be utilized, which is a modified 3+3 design that potentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time.35 In all arms, dose escalation will proceed until an MTD (or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Dose is reached. On April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decided to stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002 clinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to enter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those combinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design, patients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for Arm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in prioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory interactions. For Arm B, the study was originally designed as a dose escalation study with no expansion cohorts. However, Protocol Amendment 5 includes the rationale and description for the safety and efficacy expansion with PF-05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with metastatic or locally-recurrent/advanced triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer (TNBC). A total of 21 patients were enrolled in Arm A, 33 in Arm B and 33 patients in Arm C in the dose escalation. Approximately 124 patients are expected overall including the safety and efficacy expansion. Pharmacodynamic studies will be performed in paired tumor biopsies, when clinically feasible, to evaluate PI3K and mTOR pathway inhibition at the PF-05212384 doses used in the MTD. Paired biopsies that are obtained during dose escalation and expansion will also be evaluated for modulation of PI3K signaling. Each of the treatment arms are restricted to patients with tumor types for which the combination partner is either considered standard-of-care, or in the case of dacomitinib, are indications which have been shown to be sensitive. Figure 6. Original Overall Study Design OC CRPC: Castrate resistant prostate cancer; NSCLC: Non-small cell lung cancer; ABC: Advanced breast cancer; TCC: Transitional cell cancer; TNBC: Triple negative breast cancer; OC: ovarian cancer; HNSCC: Head and neck squamous cell cancer; BC: Breast cancer. To understand the single-dose safety and single dose PK of the study drug, a lead in period will be included. A single lead-in dose of PF-05212384 will be given either 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arms A and B) or 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arm C). The lead in period duration, subsequent doses, regimens and PK time-points may be modified based on the PK profile observed during the lead in period. Patients will then receive study treatment on an outpatient basis in 21 day cycles. Treatment with study drug will continue until progression of disease, uncontrollable toxicity, a decision by the patient or Investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study is terminated. Patients experiencing toxicity or a DLT may be managed with dose modification or discontinuation. If a patient discontinues PF-05212384 or the combination partner (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) due to toxicity which is specific to either agent, continuation of patient treatment within the study with single agent PF-05212384, cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis. The proposed doses, schedule(s) and PK timepoints may be reconsidered and amended during the study based on the emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data. 3.1. Dose Levels to Be Tested The possible dose levels for Arms A, B, and C are shown in Table 7. For Arms A and B, dose levels differ only in the dose of PF-05212384. For Arm C, dose levels differ for PF-05212384 and dacomitinib. During the dose-escalation portion, patients who have not experienced DLT at the lower doses will be treated at the next cohort which has been cleared for safety (the dose level has not been determined to exceed the MTD). The decision regarding the implementation of intra-patient dose escalation in patients treated at the MTD expansion will be considered once the MTD has been identified. Table 7. Dose Levels for Arms A, B and C # Starting dose level. * April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decided to stop enrollment in Arm A. # Starting dose level. # Starting dose level. † Dose level previously determined to exceed the MTD. * April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decided to stop enrollment in Arm C. 3.1.1. Criteria for Dose Assignment 3.1.1.1. Criteria for Dose Assignments for Arms A and B In Arms A and B, a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment. The statistical description of the method is provided in Section 9. The dose assignment recommendations of the method are provided in Figure 7. Patients are enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients. In the first cohort, the starting dose level will be assigned as noted in Table 7. For any subsequent cohort of patients, the recommended dose assignment action will be based on the total number of patients with DLTs in the current and prior cohorts treated at the same dose level. For example, if a cohort of 3 patients are treated at dose level A1 for the first time and one of them experiences a DLT, then the recommended action for the next cohort of patients will be to stay at the current dose level (S); if this recommendation is accepted, then the selected dose level for the next cohort of patients will be A1; if a cohort of 3 additional patients are treated at dose level A1 and there are no more DLTs observed, then the cumulative number of patients treated at A1 is 6, and the cumulative number of patients with DLTs at A1 is 1, thus the recommendation would be to escalate the dose for the subsequent cohort (E). Figure 7. Recommended Action Based on Cumulative DLT Data at the Current Dose Level (Arms A and B) E = Escalate to the next higher dose level S = Stay at the current dose level D = De-escalate to the next lower dose level DU = The current dose level is unacceptably toxic and should be eliminated from further testing Initially up to 3 patients will be treated in a cohort; occasionally, due to logistical reasons, more than 3 but no more than 6 patients may be enrolled in a cohort. Patients not evaluable for assessment of DLT, as described in Section 9.1 may be replaced. The actual dose level selected for the next cohort of patients will take into account the recommended dose level from Figure 7 and all available safety data other than DLTs. Dose-finding for an arm may be stopped when one of the following criteria is met: • The lowest dose level appears too toxic after at least 3 patients are dosed at that dose • The maximum sample size in dose finding of 40 evaluable patients per arm has been reached. • A minimum of 10 evaluable patients have been treated at the estimated MTD. DLTs occurring in the first cycle will be used for determining the starting dose in the subsequent cohort. All significant AEs and SAEs will be reviewed by the Sponsor and the Investigators to determine if the dose allocation schedule requires modification. 3.1.1.2. Criteria for Dose Assignment for Arm C A zone-based design will be employed for Arm C.35 It is a modified 3+3 design that potentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time. The starting dose level is C1. Dose escalation will proceed according to the sequence in Table 8 until an MTD (or two MTDs) is declared, or the Maximum Allowable Dose is reached. Table 8. Dose Escalation Sequence (Arm C) As in a classical 3+3 design, dose escalation is indicated if there is no DLT in 3 patients or ≤1 DLT in 6 patients at the current dose level. If DLT data at dose level C1 indicates dose escalation, then two separate dose escalations from C1 to C2 and from C1 to C1h may occur simultaneously (as shown in Table 8). To open dose level C2h, the DLT data from the preceding two lower dose levels C2 and C1h must both indicate dose escalation, ie, no DLT observed in 3 patients or ≤1 DLT in 6 patients for each of them. At each dose level, up to 3 patients will be enrolled initially and evaluated for DLT. Subsequent dose levels may not be opened until all patients entered at the current dose level have been treated and observed for at least one complete cycle and the number of DLTs among those patients in their first cycle has been determined. Patients not evaluable for assessment of DLT, as described in Section 9.1, may be replaced. Dose escalation will continue until the Maximum Allowable Dose level is reached or until DLTs are observed in at least 2 of the 3-6 patients treated at a dose level, leading to the conclusion that an MTD has been exceeded. The planned cohort size is 3-6 patients per dose cohort however, based upon observed toxicity or unexpected clinical findings, individual dose cohorts may be expanded beyond 6 patients after discussion and review by the Sponsor’s medical monitor and the Investigators. When a dose level exceeding an MTD has been identified, the next lower dose level is declared the MTD if 6 patients have already been treated at that dose level. Otherwise 3 additional patients are treated at the next lower dose level, and if zero or 1 patient experiences DLTs that dose level is declared the MTD. For Arm C, it is possible that more than one MTD is identified. In such case, the Sponsor in agreement with the Investigators will decide, based on all available data, the most rational dose level to enroll additional patients. 3.2. DLT Definition (All Arms) Severity of adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.03. For the purpose of dose escalation, any of the following adverse events occurring in the first cycle of treatment (starting from the lead-in dose through Cycle 2 Day 1) which are possibly attributable to the combination will be classified as DLTs: • Hematologic: • Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days. • Febrile neutropenia (defined as neutropenia ≥ Grade 3 and a single body temperature >38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C for more than one hour). • Grade ≥3 neutropenia with infection. • Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding. • Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. • Non-hematologic: • Grade ≥2 pneumonitis. • Grade ≥3 toxicities, except pneumonitis, and excluding those that have not been maximally treated (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, rash, mucositis). • Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 during the 1st cycle (including the lead-in dose). • Arm A and B: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 during the 1st cycle (including the lead-in dose). • Arm C: Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the failure to deliver at least 3 of the 4 doses of PF-05212384 and 75% of dacomitinib during the 1st cycle (including the lead-in dose(s)). • Persistent, intolerable toxicities which result in the delay of the start of the second cycle by more than 2 weeks relative to the scheduled start. • In an asymptomatic patient, Grade 3 mean QTc prolongation (QTc ≥501 msec) will first require repeat testing, re-evaluation by a qualified person, and correction of reversible causes such as electrolyte abnormalities or hypoxia for confirmation. If, after correction of any reversible causes, the Grade 3 QTc prolongation persists, then the event should be considered a DLT. 3.3. MTD Definition For Arms A and B, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression (refer to Section 9 for details) at the end of the study. Up to a maximum of 15 patients will be treated at the MTD during dose finding to define the tolerability and to evaluate clinical activity. For Arm C, upon identification of the MTD, additional patients up to a maximum of 15 will be treated at the MTD to better define the tolerability and to evaluate clinical activity. 3.4. Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with TNBC Based on the rationale provided in Section 1.3.5.1, an expansion cohort will open with implementation of Protocol Amendment 5 to assess the clinical activity and continued overall safety profile of PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin in patients with TNBC. The design is shown in the Figure 8 below. Treatment in the expansion portion of the study will continue until progression of disease, uncontrollable toxicity, a decision by the patient or Investigator to discontinue treatment, or the study is terminated. Patients experiencing toxicity may be managed with dose partner (cisplatin) due to toxicity which is specific to either agent, continuation of patient treatment within the study with single agent PF-05212384 or cisplatin will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis. Figure 8. Amendment 5 Study Design 3.4.1. Dose Rationale The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) that will be used in the safety and efficacy expansion portion of the study is 180 mg PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin. The determination of this dose was based on all information related to the overall safety profile, clinical activity, and Principal Investigator input for those patients treated at the MTD. A total of 33 patients were enrolled in Arm B at doses ranging from 90–310 mg/week in arm (B1–B8). Two DLTs were first observed at the 310 mg dose level (Grade 3 oral mucositis) leading to a dose reduction to 260 mg dose level. Rapid onset oral mucositis was then observed at the 260 mg dose level (not meeting protocol defined DLT criteria). Therefore, the 310 mg and 260 mg levels were deemed unacceptable to move forward due to rapid onset oral mucositis. Based on safety profile at 310 mg and 260 mg, the dose level selected for additional study in 10 patients was 215 mg. In the 10 patients treated at 215 mg, 6 dose reductions (to 180 mg and one patient then further reduced to 150 mg) were observed in 5 patients during Cycle 1. Five PF-05212384 Cycle 1 dosing visits were missed in 4 patients due to oral mucositis or other significant toxicities. Based upon this safety profile at the 215 mg dose level, the RP2D was selected as 180 mg IV weekly PF-05212384 in combination with cisplatin (75 mg/mg2 IV q 3wks). 4. PATIENT SELECTION This study can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate patients are enrolled. The following eligibility criteria are designed to select patients for whom protocol treatment is considered appropriate.

Life Style Guidelines Patients will be advised to report any reaction to sun exposed skin. In addition, special precautions should be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the patients’ exposure to light including high intensity UVb sources such as tanning beds, tanning booths and sunlamps. Patients should be encouraged to apply sunscreen/sunblock daily. In this study, patients of childbearing potential will receive PF-05212384, a compound for which the teratogenic risk is currently unknown. Two (2) methods of highly effective contraception must be used throughout the study and continued for 90 days after the last dose. The investigator or his/her designee, in consultation with the patient, will select two appropriate methods of contraception for the individual patient from the permitted list of contraception methods, and instruct the patient in their consistent and correct use. The investigator or his/her designee, at each study visit, will discuss with the patient the need to use highly effective contraception consistently and correctly and document such conversation in the patient chart. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the patient to call immediately if a selected birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected. Highly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and include: 1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception are allowed provided the patient remains on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an 2. Correctly placed copper containing intrauterine device (IUD). 3. Male condom or female condom used WITH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, suppository). 4. Male sterilization with appropriately confirmed absence of sperm in the post-vasectomy ejaculate. 5. Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy. 4.6. Sponsor Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the Sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the trial is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Manual. To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study number, contact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patients participation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the established communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The help desk number is not intended for use by the patient directly and if a patient calls that number they will be directed back to the investigational site. 5. STUDY TREATMENTS 5.1. Allocation to Treatment 5.1.1. Dose Escalation Portion of B2151002 Following full assessment and determination that the patient meets all eligibility criteria and has given written informed consent for study participation, arm and dose level allocation will be performed by the Sponsor. The Investigator or designee will enroll the patient according to the procedures described in the Study Manual. At the end of the enrollment process, a patient identification number will be assigned, which must be used on all Case Report Form (CRF) pages and on all trial-related documentation and correspondence referencing that patient. No patient shall receive study drug until the Investigator or designee has received the following information in writing from the Sponsor: • Confirmation of the patient’s enrolment; and • Specification of the dose level for that patient. The Sponsor or designee will notify the other sites of the inclusion of a new patient, and will inform study sites about the next possible enrollment date. Eligible patients will be enrolled to receive one of the three study drug treatment regimens in an open-label, unblinded manner. The possible dose levels are displayed in Section 3.1. In Arms A and B, a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method with adjustment based on observed DLT rate will be used to guide the dose assignment (see Section 3.1.1.1). In Arm C, a modified 3+3 design is applied that potentially allows opening of more than one dose level at the same time (see Section 3.1.1.2). Patients experiencing a DLT may be managed with dose modification or discontinuation. Laboratory values including complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry may be obtained within 72 hours of the lead-in dose and Day 1 of every subsequent cycle and reviewed to ensure appropriate values for dosing. The investigator’s knowledge of the treatment should not influence the decision to enroll a particular patient or affect the order in which patients are enrolled. 5.1.2. Safety and Efficacy Expansion in Patients with TNBC Following full assessment and determination that the patient meets all eligibility criteria and has given written informed consent for study participation, the Investigator or designee will request enrollment to a specific arm based on the patient’s prior treatment. Enrollment to a specific arm will be performed by the Sponsor. At the end of the enrollment process, a patient identification number will be assigned, which must be used on all CRF pages and on all trial-related documentation and correspondence referencing that patient. No patient shall receive study drug until the Investigator or designee has received the following information in writing from the Sponsor: • confirmation of the patient’s enrolment; and • specification of the arm for that patient; and • specification of the dose level for that patient. The Sponsor or designee will inform all sites of enrollment via regular study level communication. Patients experiencing toxicity may be managed with dose modification or discontinuation. Laboratory values including CBC and blood chemistry may be obtained within 72 hours of Day 1 of every subsequent cycle and reviewed to ensure appropriate values for dosing. 5.2. Drug Supplies PF-05212384 and dacomitinib are investigational agents and will be supplied free of charge Docetaxel and cisplatin are commercially available and will be supplied by the study center (costs will be reimbursed by Pfizer) or by Pfizer. Study centers will receive a supply of study medication upon activation. The clinical site pharmacy will prepare the study medication supply that is appropriate for the patient on that cycle. Resupplies will be made during the course of the study based on need. The study monitor should be contacted for any issues related to drug supplies. 5.2.1. Formulation and Packaging 5.2.1.1.

Preparation and Dispensing Only qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to them and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of chemotherapeutic agents. Dose adjustments or discontinuations should be managed according to the Dose Modification section below. However, per the Investigator’s discretion, other dose adjustments may be discussed with the Sponsor. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 5.2.2.1. PF-05212384 All preparations should take place under aseptic conditions. A pharmacist or pharmacy technician (under the supervision of a pharmacist) will prepare PF-05212384. Specific preparation and dispensing instructions are provided in the IP Manual. PF-05212384 is known to be incompatible with sodium chloride and care should be taken to avoid contact with saline during both preparation and IV administration. 5.2.2.2. Docetaxel Docetaxel will be stored, prepared and dispensed according to product labeling. The total docetaxel dose will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle as a 1-hour infusion. 5.2.2.3. Cisplatin Cisplatin will be stored, prepared and dispensed according to product labeling. The total cisplatin dose will be administered on Day 1 of each cycle as a 2-hour infusion. After Cycle 2, cisplatin infusion duration can be modified per institution practices. 5.2.2.4. Dacomitinib Dacomitinib tablets will be packaged in HDPE bottles, dispensed to patients with adequate supply for the visit schedule, eg, the lead-in period (7 days) or an entire treatment cycle (21 days). Dacomitinib tablets should be stored according to the product label and kept in their original containers. 5.2.3. Administration 5.2.3.1. PF-05212384 PF-05212384 should be administered weekly as described in the Schedule of Activities as an IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes and as described in the IP Manual. The use of an infusion pump is the preferred method of administration to ensure accurate delivery of the investigational product, but gravity drips are allowed. No premedication is required. In the event of allergic, infusion or hypersensitivity reactions, investigators should institute treatment measures according to best medical and nursing practice and the infusion time can be extended to a maximum of 60 minutes (See Appendix 9). DO NOT administer any sodium chloride containing solutions or medications concomitantly via the same IV line as PF-05212384. Flush IV lines with 5% Dextrose Injection both before and after PF-05212384 administration. The possible dose levels for different arms are displayed in Section 3.1. 5.2.3.1.1. Dose Escalation Portion of B2151002 Based on preclinical studies, on Day 1 for Cycles 2 and beyond, patients will receive the companion drug (docetaxel, cisplatin or dacomitinib) first followed by PF-05212384.15,16 The infusion of PF-05212384 should be initiated approximately 30 minutes following the completion of the docetaxel or cisplatin infusion (Arms A and B) or immediately following the ingestion of the dacomitinib dose (Arm C). 5.2.3.1.2. Retreatment Criteria PF-05212384 may only be administered on Day 1 of each cycle if all of the following criteria are met based on a blood sample collected within the previous 72 hours: • ANC ≥1,500/μL; • Platelets count ≥100,000/μL; • Non-hematologic toxicities (including diarrhea) have returned to baseline or Grade ≤1 severity (or, at the investigator discretion, Grade ≤2 if not considered a safety risk for the patient). 5.2.3.2. Docetaxel Docetaxel will be administered intravenously at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The total docetaxel dose will be administered as a 1-hour IV infusion. The dose of docetaxel will be calculated using body surface area (mg/m2). Docetaxel must be used in compliance with its local prescribing information which should be reviewed to ensure that appropriate patients are enrolled in the study. All patients must receive prophylactic pre-medication in order to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention and hypersensitivity reactions as per Institution’s practices. Suggested pre-medication regimen before each chemotherapy administration consists of oral dexamethasone 8 mg bid or equipotent doses of oral prednisone or prednisolone or methylprednisolone given for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administration. Low dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisone or <2 mg/day dexamethasone) are permitted at the Investigator’s discretion for patients with CRPC. 5.2.3.2.1. Retreatment Criteria Docetaxel may only be administered on Day 1 of each cycle if all the following criteria are met based on a blood sample collected within the previous 72 hours: • Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/mm3. • ALT, AST ≤1.5 x ULN and Alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5x ULN. • Bilirubin within normal limits (WNL). 5.2.3.3. Cisplatin Cisplatin will be administered intravenously at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The total dose will be administered as a 2-hour IV infusion. The dose of cisplatin will be calculated using body surface area (mg/m2). Cisplatin therapy should be immediately preceded and followed by hydration procedures according to the institution’s guidelines and administered with appropriate anti-emetics including a 5HT antagonist. 3 5.2.3.3.1. Retreatment Criteria Cisplatin may only be administered on Day 1 of each cycle if all the following criteria are met based on a blood sample collected within the previous 72 hours: • Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/mm3. • Platelets >75,000/mm3 ALT, AST ≤1.5 x ULN. • Serum creatinine ≤1 x ULN and an estimated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min. 5.2.3.4. Dacomitinib Patients will self-administer dacomitinib orally, once daily on a continuous basis. Dacominitib will be supplied as 15 mg tablets and will be taken on an empty stomach (defined as less than 500 calories within 2 hours before or after intake of study medication) and with at least 6 oz (180 mL) of water. Patients will be instructed to record daily administration of the study drugs in a patient diary. Patients will be instructed to swallow study drug tablets whole and not to chew them prior to swallowing. No tablet should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact. Patients should be instructed to take their medication at approximately the same time (±3 hours) every day. On days of PK sampling patients will be advised not to take their dose on that day, and bring their medication with them to the clinic. The dose for clinic visit days will be administered after a pre-dose PK sample is drawn. The possible dose levels of dacomitinib are displayed in Section 5.2.7.4. Patients will be instructed that if they miss a day’s dose, they must not make up the missed dose, but simply resume the dosing schedule the following day. Likewise, patients must be instructed that if they vomit at any time after taking a dose, they must not “make it up” with an extra dose the same day, but resume dosing the next day as prescribed. Similar to all administered doses, any missed or vomited doses must be indicated in the source documents and CRFs. 5.2.4. Medication Errors Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the wrong product, by the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error CRF which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page and on the serious adverse event (SAE) form when appropriate. In the event of medication error, the Sponsor should be notified immediately. Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, including: • Medication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product. • Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participating patient. Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the Investigator, the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the adverse event (AE) page and, if applicable, any associated adverse event(s) are captured on an adverse event (AE) CRF page. 5.2.5. Recommended Dose Modifications Every effort should be made to administer study treatment on the planned dose and schedule. In the event of significant toxicity, dosing may be delayed and/or reduced as described below. In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed. Patients are to be instructed to notify Investigators at the first occurrence of any adverse symptom. Dose modifications may occur in three ways: • Within a cycle: dose interruption/reduction until adequate recovery during a given treatment cycle. • Between cycles: next cycle administration may be postponed due to toxicity in the previous cycle. • In the next cycle: dose reduction based on worst toxicity in the previous cycle. 5.2.6. Dose Interruptions/Delay PF-05212384: If PF-05212384 treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld are counted as cycle days and missed doses are skipped. For Arm C, the day treatment is restarted with PF-05212384 will be counted as Day 1 of the next cycle, and the previous cycle is extended accordingly. A treatment delay or interruption of >2 consecutive weeks due to lack of toleration will result in discontinuation of the patient from the study drug, following discussion with the Sponsor. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities considered to be related only to PF-05212384 and not to the combination drug (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib), continuation of patient treatment within the study with the combination drug (cisplatin, docetaxel, or dacomitinib) as a single agent will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis. Docetaxel: If toxicities persist and docetaxel cannot be re-administered for >2 weeks after the expected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35 days from the start of docetaxel in the current cycle), the Sponsor should be contacted to discuss treatment continuation. For Arm A, the day treatment is restarted with docetaxel will be counted as Day 1 of the next cycle, and the previous cycle is extended accordingly. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities considered to be related only to docetaxel and not to PF-05212384, continuation of patient treatment within the study with PF-05212384 as a single agent will be discussed with Cisplatin: If toxicities persist and cisplatin cannot be re-administered for >2 weeks after the expected administration of the subsequent cycle (>35 days from the start of cisplatin in the current cycle), the Sponsor should be contacted to discuss treatment continuation. For Arm B, the day treatment is restarted with cisplatin will be counted as Day 1 of the next cycle, and the previous cycle is extended accordingly. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities considered to be related only to cisplatin and not to PF-05212384, continuation of patient treatment within the study with PF-05212384 as a single agent will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis. Dacomitinib: If dacomitinib treatment is interrupted, the days when treatment is withheld are counted as treatment days and missed doses are skipped. The Sponsor should be contacted to discuss study continuation of the patient. Treatment delay or interruption of >2 consecutive weeks due to lack of toleration will result in discontinuation of the patient from the study drug, following discussion with the Sponsor. If a patient experiences unacceptable toxicities considered to be related only to dacomitinib and not to PF-05212384, continuation of patient treatment within the study with PF-05212384 as a single agent will be discussed with the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis. In the event of a treatment interruption for reasons other than treatment-related toxicity (eg, elective surgery) lasting >2 weeks, treatment resumption will be decided in consultation with the Sponsor. 5.2.7. Dose Reductions Following dose interruption or cycle delay due to toxicity, the study drug dose may need to be reduced when treatment is resumed. Dose reductions may be independent for each drug in the combination as suggested by the toxicity profile and the adverse event. After the first cycle, dose reductions may be required based on the worst toxicity experienced in the previous cycle. Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles should be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reduction is required. Dose re-escalation is not allowed unless discussed with the Sponsor. In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed. Suggested dose reduction criteria are described below for each drug administered in this study. These criteria are provided as guidance only. Decisions on dose reduction and resumption of treatment will be determined according to the judgment of the Investigator. Arms A and B: Patients experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of PF-05212384, may resume dosing at the next lower dose level of PF-05212384 once adequate recovery is achieved. Chemotherapy (ie, docetaxel and cisplatin) should be maintained at the starting dose unless a chemotherapy-related toxicity mandates a dose reduction. Possible dose levels of PF-05212384 according to study arm are shown in Table 9. Recommended dose reductions for PF-05212384, docetaxel and cisplatin are shown in Table 10, Table 11 and Table 12, respectively. Arm C: Patients treated at dose level 1 of PF-05212384 experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of PF-05212384 should be withdrawn from treatment unless otherwise agreed between the Investigator and the Sponsor. Patients treated at dose level 1of dacomitinib experiencing a toxicity that requires a dose reduction of dacomitinib may resume dosing at the next lower dose level, once adequate recovery is achieved. Patients treated at subsequent dose levels of PF-05212384 or dacomitinib experiencing a toxicity that requires dose reduction of PF-05212384 or dacomitinib, will have their dose modified once they have adequately recovered from the toxicity. Possible dose levels of PF-05212384 and dacomitinib are shown in Table 9 and Table 13, respectively. Recommended dose reductions for PF-05212384 and dacomitinib are shown in Table 10 and Table 14, respectively. If a patient has a dose reduction for a drug-related toxicity, the dose will not be re-escalated. 5.2.7.1. PF-05212384 Possible dose levels of PF-05212384 according to study arm are shown in Table 9. In Arms A and B, patients treated at dose level 1 of PF-05212384 experiencing a toxicity in Cycle 1 that requires dose reduction, will receive a reduced dose of PF-05212384 to 75 mg/wk for Cycle 2 onwards. In Arm C, patients treated at dose level 1 of PF-05212384 experiencing a toxicity during Cycle 1 that requires dose reduction of PF-05212384, should be withdrawn from treatment unless otherwise agreed between the Investigator and the Sponsor. Table 9. Possible Dose Levels of PF-05212384 # starting dose Guidelines for dose modification of toxicities considered related to PF-05212384 are shown in Table 10. Table 10. PF-05212384 - Dose Modification Guidelines for Related Toxicities WPuolmrsot nTaorxyi ctiotxyi c(CityT C(pAnEeu vm.4o.n03it)i PF-05212384 5.2.7.2. Docetaxel The docetaxel dose may be reduced to 60 mg/m2 for Cycle 2 onwards depending on individual tolerability. The minimum dose acceptable for docetaxel will be 60 mg/m2. Guidelines for dose modification of docetaxel are shown in Table 11. For the management of docetaxel related toxicities and for retreatment criteria at the start of each cycle, refer to the product label. The use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia will be permitted for Cycle 1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2 onwards, according to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006 should be followed.37 Table 11. Docetaxel - Dose Modification Guidelines for Related Toxicities for a New Cycle Based on Worst Toxicity Observed in the Prior Cycle (mg/m2) 1 If symptoms persist with dosage adjusted, docetaxel should be discontinued. 2 If abnormal values recover (ie, bilirubin ≤ULN; AST or ALT ≤1.5xULN; AP ≤2.5xULN) within the duration of the cycle + a maximum of 2 weeks, re-treat at 1 dose level reduction. If abnormal values do not recover, discontinue treatment with docetaxel. 3 Severe hypersensitivity reactions consist often in severe hypotension, bronchospasm or generalized rash/erythema. 5.2.7.3. Cisplatin The cisplatin dose may be reduced to 60 mg/m2 (approximately 75% of starting dose) and 40 mg/m2 (approximately 50% of starting dose) for Cycles 2 onwards depending on individual tolerability. Guidelines for dose modification of cisplatin are shown in Table 12. For the management of cisplatin related toxicities and for retreatment criteria at the start of The use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia will be permitted for Cycle 1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2 onwards, according to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006 should be followed.37 Table 12. Cisplatin - Dose Modification Guidelines for Related Toxicities for a New Cycle Based on Worst Toxicity Observed in Prior Cycle (mg/m2) (1) If symptoms persist with dosage adjusted, cisplatin should be discontinued. (2) Use of antiemetic supportive care is mandatory, as per local practices. (3) Investigator discretion based on the type of toxicity seen and which course is medically most sound. 5.2.7.4. Dacomitinib As shown in Table 13, the dacomitinib dose may be reduced for Cycle 2 onwards depending on individual tolerability. The minimum acceptable dose for dacomitinib will be 15 mg QD. Table 13. Possible Dose Levels for Dacomitinib # starting dose Guidelines for dose modification of dacomitinib are shown in Table 14. Table 14. Dacomitinib - Dose Modifications Guidelines for Related Toxicities Based on Worst Toxicity Observed 5.2.8. Compliance 5.2.8.1. PF-05212384, Docetaxel, and Cisplatin The site will complete required dosage Preparation Record located in the study manual. The use of the Preparation Record is preferred but it does not preclude the use of an existing appropriate clinical site documentation system. The existing clinical site's documentation system should capture all pertinent/required information on the preparation and administration of the dose. This may be used in place of the Preparation Record after approval from the Pfizer monitor. 5.2.8.2. Dacomitinib Patients will maintain diaries to include missed or changed doses, or significantly delayed doses (ie, >6 hours from intended dosing time). Patients will be required to return all unused study medication at the beginning of each cycle. The number of tablets returned by the patient will be counted, documented and recorded by site personnel. All empty, partially empty and un-used bottles should be returned to the site for drug accountability purposes and held at the site until monitored. The Investigator and study team will also evaluate patient compliance with the study regimen. Potential reasons for non-compliant dosing (ie, AEs, lost medication) will be followed up by the study site personnel and strategies to improve dosing compliance will be 5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability The Investigator, or an approved representative (eg, pharmacist), will ensure that all trial drug is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions on the product labels, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under no circumstances should the Investigator or other site personnel supply trial drug to other Investigators, patients, or clinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed by this protocol without prior authorization from Pfizer. Pfizer may supply drug accountability forms that must be used or may approve use of standard institution forms (eg, NCI form). In either case, the forms must identify the investigational product, including batch numbers, and account for its disposition on a patient by patient basis, including specific dates and quantities. The forms must be signed by the individual who dispensed the drug, and copies must be provided to Pfizer. Adequate records documenting receipts, use, return, loss, or other disposition of study drugs must be kept. Study drug (vials and tablets) must be used according to the protocol directions. The reason for missed doses should be entered on the Case Report Form. To ensure adequate records, all trial drug supplies will be accounted for in the case report form and drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer. Unless otherwise authorized by Pfizer, at the end of the clinical trial all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the patients must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent (eg, CRO). If Pfizer authorizes destruction at the trial site, the Investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Pfizer. Destruction must be adequately documented. Investigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by using alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working correctly as required for proper storage of investigational products. These include thermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature excursions should be reported to the sponsor. The investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the Sponsor. Once a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until the Sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product. Storage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Investigator Brochure [IB], Core Data Sheet [CDS], United States Package Insert [USPI], Summary of Product Characteristics [SPC], or Local Product Document [LPD] may be superseded by the label storage. 5.3.1. PF-05212384 PF-05212384 should be stored as indicated in its original labeled carton, per the labeled storage conditions. The product label will supersede any instructions in the IB for PF-05212384. If the investigational product does not appear to be visually appropriate (eg, broken vial), it should not be administered and the Sponsor should be contacted immediately for further instruction. 5.3.2. Docetaxel and Cisplatin Docetaxel and cisplatin storage conditions are described in the product label for each drug. 5.3.3. Dacomitinib Dacomitinib tablets should be stored as indicated, according to the labeled storage conditions (which may supersede any instructions in the IB for dacomitinib). Patients should be instructed to keep their medication in its original container. 5.4. Concomitant Medication(s) Palliative and supportive care for disease related symptoms may be administered at the Investigator’s discretion and according to any available American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines.37 All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as interventions (eg, analgesic use, paracentesis, etc) received by patients from screening until the End of Treatment visit will be recorded on the CRF. Primary prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors is not permitted but they may be used to treat treatment-emergent neutropenia as indicated by the current ASCO guidelines. Patients currently being treated with bisphosphonates may continue treatment as long as the treatment has been initiated before the first dose of study drug. Initiation of bisphosphonate therapy after randomization will be considered progression of disease unless otherwise agreed by the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor. Patients on warfarin should be carefully monitored when study drug is initiated and patients on study drug should have frequent PT and INR monitoring should anticoagulation with warfarin be initiated. Additionally for over the counter pain or fever management, if no alternative non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are viable, acetaminophen may be used but should be discontinued 24 hours prior to administration of PF-05212384. It can be re-initiated 24 hours after the end of PF-05212384 infusion. Patients should avoid concomitant medications that are known to prolong QT/QTc interval. The docetaxel and cisplatin product labels should be consulted for any restrictions that may apply for concomitant medications. 5.4.1. Drugs Interacting with CYP3A4 In all treatment arms, patients should avoid the use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors as well as strong CYP3A4 inducers. Because inhibition of CYP3A4 isoenzymes may increase study drug exposure leading to a potential increase in toxicities, the use of known strong inhibitors (Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: grapefruit juice or grapefruit/grapefruit related citrus fruits (eg, Seville oranges, clarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, nefazodone, lopinavir, troleandomycin, mibefradil, conivaptan; Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: Erythromycin, verapamil, atazanavir, fluconazole, darunavir, diltiazem, delavirdine, imatinib, tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, cimetidine)38 are not permitted from 7-days prior to the first dose of study drug until study treatment discontinuation. Aprepitant is classified as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, although use is allowed if no suitable alternative can be identified. Study drug metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (eg, phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentin, clevidipine, St. John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Therefore co-administration of study drug in combination with these and other strong CYP3A4 inducers is not permitted from 7-days prior to the first dose of PF-05212384 until study treatment discontinuation. 5.4.2. CYP2D6 Substrates (Arm C only) Dacomitinib inhibited CYP2D6 activity in vitro with an IC50 of 0.063 μM (~30 ng/mL). Drug-drug interaction of dacomitinib with substrates of CYP2D6 could occur depending on the systemic concentrations of dacomitinib achieved in the clinical study and dependence of the CYP2D6 substrate on 2D6 for metabolism. Therefore drugs dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism with narrow therapeutic index eg, procainamide, pimozide and thioridazine are prohibited in combination with dacomitinib. The use of drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism requires consideration of both the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. Substitution within the therapeutic class is recommended if possible, otherwise the directions below should be followed. • For drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism: dose reduction should be based on substrate sensitivity to CYP2D6 metabolism. As a guidance, a starting dose reduction of 75% (25% of the dose given without co-administration with dacomitinib) should be considered and close clinical monitoring is required. • For drugs that are partly dependent on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism, there is a high likelihood of supra-therapeutic exposure in combination with dacomitinib. No dose reduction is required when starting dacomitinib, but clinical monitoring is required; based on the patient’s response, dose reductions may be necessary. • Pro-drugs, or drugs with highly active metabolites such as codeine and tramadol, should be replaced with an alternative within the therapeutic class as conversion to the pharmacologically active moiety is CYP2D6 metabolism-dependent and their exposure with the co-administration of dacomitinib may be sub-therapeutic. Opiates such as morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and oxycodone can be used as substitutes to replace codeine or tramadol for analgesia. Appendix 8 provides a comprehensive list of CYP2D6 substrates coded according to the therapeutic index and the degree of CYP2D6 metabolism. This is not an all inclusive list. If there is uncertainty whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, the Investigator should contact the Sponsor study team. 5.4.3. P-glycoprotein Substrates (Arm C only) Concurrent administration of drugs which are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and have a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin) should be monitored for exaggerated effect and/or toxicities. 5.4.4. Strong Amines (Arm C only) Lidocaine exposures may significantly increase in the presence of strong amines, such as dacomitinib. Lidocaine may be used systemically but clinical monitoring (including telemetry) is recommended.36 5.4.5. Other Anti-tumor/Anti-cancer or Experimental Drugs No additional anti-tumor therapy will be permitted while patients are receiving study therapy. Additionally, the concurrent use of herbal supplements is not permitted. Low dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisone or <2 mg/day dexamethasone) or luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for patients with CRPC on Arm A. 5.4.6. Supportive Care Palliative radiotherapy is permitted for the treatment of painful bony lesions providing the lesions were known to be present at the time of study entry and the Investigator clearly indicates that the need for palliative radiotherapy is not indicative of disease progression. In view of the current lack of data about the interaction of the investigational agents PF-05212384 and dacomitinib with radiotherapy, study drug treatment should be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy, stopping 5 days before and resuming treatment after recovery of any radiotherapy-related toxicity to baseline. Medication intended solely for supportive care (eg, analgesics, antidepressants) may be used at the Investigator’s discretion. 5.4.7. Hematopoietic Growth Factors The use of hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF) for the treatment of febrile neutropenia will be permitted for Cycle 1 onwards and to support neutrophil counts for Cycles 2 onwards, according to local guidelines. In the absence of local guidelines, the ASCO guidelines 2006 should be followed.37 Erythropoietin may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for the supportive treatment of anemia. 5.4.8. Corticosteroids Chronic, systemic high-dose treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone ≥12.5 mg/day or dexamethasone ≥2 mg/day) should be avoided with the exception of Arm A. Treatment with docetaxel requires mandatory prophylactic pre-medication with corticosteroids. Also, low dose steroids (<12.5 mg/day of oral prednisone or <2 mg/day dexamethasone) may be used at the Investigator’s discretion for patients with CRPC on Arm A. Steroids for the acute treatment of skin rash or respiratory toxicity are allowed. 5.4.9. Surgery Caution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The appropriate interval of time between surgery and study treatment required to minimize the risk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping study treatment is recommended at least 7 days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to reinitiate study treatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound healing and recovery from surgery. 5.4.10. Oral Mucositis – Prophylaxis and Management Oral mucositis was observed in 50% of patients treated in the PF-05212384/cisplatin combination. The Sponsor highly recommends one or more of the following strategies for prevention of oral mucositis. These strategies are outlined below and are recommended to begin pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and continued as clinically indicated. Patients who have not had a dental checkup within 6 months prior to start of dosing are encouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent chemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to undertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to proceed depending on presence of any ongoing oral mucosal inflammation. To decrease the rate and severity of oral mucositis, the patient should perform a steroid containing “swish-and-spit” regimen eg., dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 ml swish and expectorate, four times daily. The daily number of steroid containing mouth rinses can be reduced as clinically indicated. Topical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the Investigator and according to local clinical practices. Patients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently and use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Also, frequent sips of water during meals may assist swallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral pain. Use of chlorhexidine is to be avoided. Between scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes in appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral cavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report between visits. Consultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of adequate caloric intake. 6. STUDY PROCEDURES All patients being considered for the trial must sign an informed consent for the trial prior to any trial specific procedures. Trial procedures are described in the Section 7 and in the Schedule of Activities. Safety laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation) and tumor assessments may be done up to 72 hours prior to scheduled Day 1 visit on any cycle to facilitate availability of results to the Investigator at the time of clinic visit. Other tests and/or increased frequency of examinations or clinical follow up may be needed for patient management depending on findings emerging from the study. The results of these additional tests or examinations will be recorded on the CRF. 6.1. Screening All patients being considered for the trial and eligible for screening must sign an informed consent form prior to performing any trial related procedures that are not standard of care. The Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will explain the benefits and risks of participation in the trial to each patient, patient’s legal representative or impartial witness, and obtain written informed consent prior to the patient entering the trial (before initiation of non-routine tests and administration of trial drug). The final ICD must be agreed to by Pfizer and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) in language readily understood by the patient. The Investigator will retain each patient’s original consent form, signed and dated by the patient or by the patient’s legal representative, and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. This protocol requires clinical visits and evaluations to determine eligibility prior to trial enrollment and the first dose of study drug (See Schedule of activities and its footnotes). Required screening and baseline laboratory evaluations are summarized in Section 7.1.3. Patients will be assigned individual trial identification numbers at the time they are approved and registered for enrollment. Baseline assessments must be performed within 28 days (unless otherwise specified) prior to commencing study treatment, as outlined on the schedule of activities. Baseline tumor biopsy samples may be archival (see Schedule of Activities, Footnote 23) and if the patient has consented to a fresh tumor biopsy, this must be performed within 28 days prior to the start of study treatment. Study treatment start is considered 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arms A and B) or 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (Arm C). As part of the screening/baseline assessment, all patients will undergo a complete medical history, including ongoing concomitant medications, clinical assessments (including vital signs, height, body weight, ECOG performance status, baseline signs and symptoms, and triplicate 12-lead resting ECG), MUGA or ECHO (Arm C patients), and tumor assessments. Documentation of tumor history (Primary Diagnosis) should include histological or cytological classification, stage information, treatment history (surgery, systemic treatment and radiotherapy) as well as duration and best response to immediate prior regimen, tumor grade, histologic subtype, and relevant tumor-specific molecular markers, if available (eg, PI3K/mTOR/Akt pathway alteration [PIK3CA mutation, PTEN loss] KRAS, BRAF, HER2 or EGFR gene expression and/or mutation status). In addition, information regarding the sample type for the initial diagnostic biopsy will be collected. The required baseline laboratory tests include: blood hematology and chemistry, HbA1c, pregnancy test (serum or urine), and urinalysis. Consent will be required for all patients enrolling in this study to access archived tumor biopsies to examine variation in proteins and genes associated with PI3K, HER-family receptor and MAPK signaling; examples include PTEN and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, AKT, KRAS, and BRAF. If an archived biopsy is not available, a fresh biopsy sample at baseline will be required. Paired tumor biopsies are also required from patients treated in the MTD cohorts (see Section 7.3). Following completion of the screening assessments and confirmation of eligibility, patients may be enrolled. For screening procedures see Schedule of Activities and Section 7. 6.2. Study Period For treatment period procedures, see Schedule of Activities and Section 7. 6.3. Follow-up Visit For follow-up procedures see Schedule of Activities and Section 7. 6.4. Patient Withdrawal Patients may withdraw from treatment at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for safety or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site. Reasons for withdrawal of study treatment may include: • Objective disease progression according to RECIST; • Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation; • Adverse event; • QTc prolongation of >500 msec or 60 msec over baseline; • Pregnancy; • Medication error without associated adverse event; • Significant protocol violation; • Lost to follow-up; • Patient no longer willing to participate in study; • Study terminated by Sponsor; • Death. Reasons for withdrawal from study follow-up may include: • Completed study follow-up; • Study terminated by Sponsor; • Lost to follow-up; • Patient refusal for further follow-up; • Death. If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the patient. All attempts to contact the patient and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the patient’s medical record. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document patient outcome, if possible. The Investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the patient to return all unused investigational product(s), request the patient to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow-up with the patient regarding any unresolved adverse events. If the patient withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. If the study is prematurely terminated for reasons other than safety, the Sponsor will make reasonable efforts, in accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, to provide PF-05212384 and/or dacomitinib to patients deriving therapeutic benefit, for as long as appropriate drug supplies are available and, for patients treated in this study, until the treatment is authorized and commercially available for this use. 7. ASSESSMENTS Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are completed as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside of the control of the Investigator, that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the Investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well being of the patient. When a protocol required test cannot be performed the Investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion. 7.1. Safety Assessments Safety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination, ECG (12-lead), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measurements, and laboratory assessments including pregnancy tests. In addition, the use of concurrent medications will be determined. 7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study therapy; once at the start of Screening and once at the baseline visit, within 72 hours of study treatment start. A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive the investigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and additionally whenever one menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of a positive hCG test, the patient will be withdrawn from study medication but may remain in the study. Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required by local regulations. 7.1.2. Adverse Events Assessment of adverse events will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] version 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness. Baseline signs and symptoms will be recorded at baseline and then reported as adverse events during the study if they worsen in severity or increase in frequency. 7.1.3. Laboratory Safety Assessments Blood for hematology and chemistry will be drawn prior to the administration of study treatment at the time points described in the Schedule of Activities and analyzed at local laboratories. Investigators may have additional blood tests performed for the purpose of planning treatment administration, dose modification, or following AEs. Table 15. List of Laboratory Test Assessments 7.1.4. Vital Signs and Physical Examination Patients will have a physical exam to include an examination of major body systems and an assessment for emergent toxicities or changes from prior visits, weight, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate to be recorded in the sitting position after approximately 5 minutes of rest), assessment of ECOG performance status and height; height will be measured at baseline only. Complete physical examinations will be conducted by a physician, trained physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner, as acceptable according to local regulation. 7.1.5. (12-Lead) ECG Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be used for all ECGs. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the standard intervals automatically. At each time point (see the Schedule of Activities), three consecutive ECGs will be performed at approximately 2 minutes apart to determine the mean ECGs should be re-evaluated by a qualified person at the site for confirmation as soon as the finding is made, including verification that the machine reading is accurate. If manual reading verifies a QTc of ≥501 msec, immediate correction for reversible causes (including electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia and concomitant medications for drugs with the potential to prolong the QTc interval) should be performed. In addition, repeat ECGs should be immediately performed hourly for at least 3 hours until the QTc interval falls below 501 msec. If QTc interval reverts to less than 501 msec, and in the judgment of Investigator(s) and Sponsor is determined to be due to cause(s) other than study drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If QTc interval >500 msec or an increase of >60 msec is considered to be related to study therapy, the patient will be discontinued from the study. Prior to concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study drug, thorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in patient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and possible evaluation by specialist. If a patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures, or stroke), an ECG should be obtained at the time of the event. Also, additional triplicate ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated. When matched with PK sampling, the ECG should be collected prior to the scheduled PK draw; the timing of the PK collection over rides the timing for the ECG collection (ie, if a PK sample is scheduled at 1 hour post dose and an ECG is scheduled 1 hour post dose, then the ECGs should be collected just prior to the 1 hour PK collection, and the PK sample should be collected at the nominal time). 7.1.6. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Measurements (Arm C only) Determination of LVEF by either MUGA scan or ECHO will be measured at baseline, the end of Cycle 3, the end of Cycle 6, and then every 6 cycles for Arm C patients only. The same technique should be used throughout for an individual patient. If an absolute decrease in LVEF of >20% is noted, by either MUGA or ECHO, then the LVEF will be repeated as soon as feasible using the alternate radiologic method (if available); if the decrease is verified further, cardiac evaluation will be undertaken per the judgment of Investigator. In the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction or LVEF <40%, treatment may continue if judgment of the Investigator is that patient may benefit from ongoing therapy. Any clinically significant changes will be recorded as adverse events and further evaluated as clinically warranted at the discretion of the Investigator. For any patient discontinuing therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of left ventricular dysfunction, continued evaluation of LVEF at about 3-4 month interval to assess for resolution is recommended. 7.2. Pharmacokinetics Assessments Blood samples (3 mL whole blood per sample collection timepoint) will be collected for PK analysis of PF-05212384, docetaxel, and dacomitinib (and the desmethyl metabolite PF-05199265) as outlined in the Schedule of Activities. A blood sample of 6 mL of whole blood per sample collection timepoint, will be collected for the PK analysis of cisplatin as outlined in the Schedule of Activities. Blood samples for PK assessment will be collected up through Cycle 6. PK sampling schedule may be modified based on emerging PK data. In addition to samples collected at the scheduled times, when feasible, an additional blood sample should be collected from patients experiencing unexpected and/or serious AEs which are suspected to be related to study drug treatment and the date and time documented in the CRF. All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the scheduled nominal time relative to dosing. However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 minute sample) will be considered protocol compliant, and the exact time of the sample collection noted on the CRF. If a scheduled blood sample collection cannot be completed for any reason, the missed sample time may be re-scheduled with agreement of clinical Investigators, patient, and Sponsor. PK samples will be assayed for PF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib (and its metabolite PF-05199265) using validated analytical methods in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures. Details regarding the collection, processing, storage and shipping of the blood samples will be provided in the Study Manual. As part of understanding the pharmacokinetics of the study drugs, samples may be used for future metabolite identification and/or further evaluation of the bioanalytical methods. These data will be used for internal exploratory purposes and will not be included in the clinical report. Samples collected for this purpose will be retained in accordance to local regulations and if not processed during the course of these experiments, will be discarded. 7.2.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC Blood samples (3 mL whole blood per sample collection timepoint) will be collected for PK analysis of PF-05212384 as outlined in the Schedule of Activities. Blood samples for PK assessment will be collected up through Cycle 6. PK sampling schedule may be modified based on emerging PK data. In addition to samples collected at the scheduled times, when feasible, an additional blood sample should be collected from patients experiencing unexpected and/or serious AEs which are suspected to be related to study drug treatment and the date and time documented in the CRF. All efforts will be made to obtain the pharmacokinetic samples at the scheduled nominal time relative to dosing. However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 minute sample) will be considered protocol compliant, and the exact time completed for any reason, the missed sample time may be re-scheduled with agreement of clinical Investigators, patient, and Sponsor. PK samples will be assayed for PF-05212384 using validated analytical methods in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures. Details regarding the collection, processing, storage and shipping of the blood samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. As part of understanding the pharmacokinetics of the study drugs, samples may be used for future metabolite identification and/or further evaluation of the bioanalytical methods. These data will be used for internal exploratory purposes and will not be included in the clinical report. Samples collected for this purpose will be retained in accordance to local regulations and if not processed during the course of these experiments, will be discarded. 7.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments Biomarker assessments are described below in more detail, however additional markers may be included as pre-clinical studies or literature reports further elucidate the mechanism of action of any of the investigational products. Details on preparation and handling of all biomarker samples including processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. The source of the samples is listed below in Table 16. Please also refer to the Schedule of Activities and the Laboratory Manual for details pertaining to specific days of sample collection and sample preparation. (cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44) 7.3.1. Tumor Biopsy Acquisition of the mandatory archival FFPE tumor tissue block or unstained slides representing primary or metastatic tumor tissue are required and may be completed prior to the 28 day screening window, but it is required for patient enrollment. Note that if archival FFPE tumor tissue cannot be provided, a fresh biopsy is required. Patients may not be enrolled into the study without providing either an archived or fresh tumor sample. For the tumor sample, paraffin blocks are preferred, but freshly cut slides will be accepted. At least twenty unstained, 5-micron slides prepared from the paraffin block must be provided. Sample will be analyzed for genetic markers indicative of drug sensitivity (eg, PIK3CA, BRCA1, other). This study is designed to utilize phosphoproteomics techniques to evaluate signaling pathways that could be modified in vivo by the drugs used in this study. The biomarker studies will be used to help understand the in vivo mechanism of action of the agents, levels of pathway blockade in response to treatment, and potential mechanisms of resistance owing to the inherent plasticity in cancer cell signaling pathways. To meet this goal, biopsies obtained pre- and post-study treatment (ie, “paired” or “matched” fresh tumor biopsies) will be requested from all patients including the dose escalation and the MTD cohorts. The paired tumor core biopsy are mandatory for patients enrolled in the MTD cohorts unless the Investigator considers it to pose a safety risk to the patient; in this case, a discussion between the Investigator and Sponsor should take place before a final decision is made. Examples of safety risks may include, but are not limited to pulmonary metastases deep within the thoracic cavity with high probability of bleeding or lung injury or liver metastases located within the liver posing a high risk of bleeding if biopsied. Biopsies obtained pre- and post-study treatment will be requested from all patients in the expansion portion of the study enrolling patients with TNBC. Biopsies will be obtained at screening and after drug administration as indicated in the Schedule of Activities. A formalin fixed paraffin block will be prepared and collected from each biopsy. These paired samples will be analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein biomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug sensitivity (eg, emerging KRAS mutation). Additional markers may be included as pre-clinical studies or literature reports further elucidate the mechanisms of action of any of the study drugs. (cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44) Details on preparation handling of these samples including processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 7.3.2. Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens Whole blood biospecimens will be collected pre dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 15 post-dose, but no more than 72 hours later). Baseline biospecimens will be utilized for circulating tumor cell and germline BRCA analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or platelets from whole blood will be isolated for analysis of surrogate protein markers for drug sensitivity using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis. 7.3.3. Effect of PI3K Inhibition on Glucose Metabolism A PI3K/mTOR inhibitor should disrupt the cellular uptake and metabolism of glucose. In the Phase 1 studies, administration of PF-05212384 resulted in increased levels of circulating glucose, insulin, and c-peptide within one week of therapy, as well as increased levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after about one month of therapy. These observations suggest that gedatolisib can block the PI3K/mTOR signaling in humans and that blood based biomarkers can be utilized as pharmacodynamics biomarkers. The current studies will therefore employ metabolic biomarkers such as glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c as pharmacodynamics markers for dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition. 7.4. Tumor Response Assessments Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. Imaging must include the chest (chest x-ray or high resolution CT) at baseline and at all subsequent cycles in order to monitor for pulmonary effects of the study drug PF-05212384 and to monitor target or non-target lesions in the chest. Imaging should include abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI scans if disease is being followed in these areas. A brain CT or MRI scan for patients with known or suspected brain metastases and bone scan and/or bone x-rays for patients with known or suspected bone metastases are required. The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments. Anti-tumor activity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline, during treatment as specified in the Schedule of Events, whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the End of Treatment visit (if not done in the previous 6 weeks). Patients who have had a tumor assessment as standard of care within 28 days of the lead-in dose but prior to signing the ICD will not need to have a re-assessment solely for the purposes of the study, as long as the appropriate data is available for entry onto the study CRF. Assessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 (Appendix 2). All patients’ files and radiologic images must be available for source verification and for potential peer review. (cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44) 7.6. Patient Reported Outcomes in the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC Patient reported outcomes of health-related quality of life and breast cancer specific disease/treatment related symptoms will be assessed using European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the corresponding module for breast cancer (EORTC QLQ-BR23) (Appendix 10 and Appendix 11 respectively). Patients will complete each instrument at pre-dose on Day 1 and Day 8 of Cycle 1 and 2, on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle starting with Cycle 3 and at the end of treatment visit. Completed questionnaires are always considered source document and must be filed accordingly. Patients must complete these instruments in clinic (cannot be taken home) and prior to having any tests and to any discussion of their progress with the physician or clinic personnel at the site. Interviewer administration in clinic may be used under special circumstances (eg, patient forgot their glasses or feels too ill). The instruments will be given to the patient in the appropriate language for the site. 7.6.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3.0) and the QLQ-BR23 module (Appendix 10 and Appendix 11, respectively) were selected for inclusion in the study as they are responsive to clinical status and change over time and are also the two most commonly used patient reported measures in breast cancer clinical studies.47 Both self report measures are also widely recognized as clinically valid and reliable measures for assessing global QOL, disease symptoms, and treatment related symptoms in breast cancer patients. The EORTC QLQ-C30 (see Appendix 10) consists of 30 questions which are incorporated into five multi-item functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social domains); a global health status/ global quality of life (QOL) scale; three multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting scales); and six single items that assess additional cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea) and the perceived financial burden of treatment. The questionnaire employs 28 4-point Likert scales with responses from “not at all” to “very much” and two 7-point Likert scales for global health and overall QOL.48 For functional and global QOL scales, higher scores represent a better level of functioning and are converted to a 0 to 100 scale using standard scoring algorithm.49 For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score represents more severe symptoms. The EORTC QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the EORTC QLQ-C30 and consists of two functional scales (body image and sexuality); three symptom subscales (arm/hand, breast, and systemic side effects) and single items covering sexual enjoyment, distress at hair loss, and future perspective. Both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR-23 module require about 15 minutes to complete and are available in many languages. 8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 8.1. Adverse Events All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following sections. For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event (SAE) requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated representative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the Investigator to determine the causality of the AE. The Investigator is required to assess causality. Follow-up by the Investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non-serious adverse event that is determined by the Sponsor to be serious will be reported by the Sponsor as a SAE. To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may be requested from the Investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study. 8.2. Reporting Period For SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the Investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the Investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the Sponsor. AEs (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has taken at least one dose of investigational product through the patient’s last visit. • If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non-serious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatment. 8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to: • Abnormal test findings; • Clinically significant symptoms and signs; • Changes in physical examination findings; • Hypersensitivity; • Drug abuse; • Drug dependency. Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from: • Drug overdose; • Drug withdrawal; • Drug misuse; • Drug interactions; • Extravasation; • Exposure during pregnancy (EDP); • Exposure via breastfeeding; • Medication error; • Occupational exposure; • Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be reported as AEs. 8.4. Abnormal Test Findings The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows: • Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or • Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or • Test result leads to a change in study dosing (outside of protocol-stipulated dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or • Test result is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or Sponsor. Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 8.5. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: • Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death); • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); • Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; • Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the safety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease progression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an AE and as an SAE with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 5 (see Section on Severity Assessment). Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.5.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events There are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety database (see Section 8.13.1 SAE Reporting Requirements). 8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury Liver Function Tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure in this study. However, should an Investigator deem it necessary to run LFTs because of clinical sign/symptom presentation in a patient, such LFT results should be handled and followed up as described below. Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be considered important medical events. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug-induced liver injury depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Patients who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: • Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST or ALT values ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value ≥2 X ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value ≤2 X ULN or not available. • For patients with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the upper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned above. • For patients with pre-existing AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range, AST or ALT value ≥2 times the baseline values and ≥3 X ULN, or ≥8 X ULN (whichever is smaller). • Concurrent with • For patients with pre-existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: Total bilirubin level increased from baseline by an amount of at least one time the upper limit of normal or if the value reaches ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (whichever is smaller). The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history and physical assessment. The possibility of hepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline phosphatase. A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no other cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy’s Law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs. Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs. 8.6. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical importance. Hospitalization does not include the following: • Rehabilitation facilities; • Hospice facilities; • Respite care (eg, caregiver relief); • Skilled nursing facilities; • Nursing homes; • Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: • Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for work-up of persistent pre-treatment laboratory abnormality); • Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep); • Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination); • Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg, for a procedure required by the study protocol); • Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective cosmetic surgery); • Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE; • Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient; • Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products. Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 8.7. Severity Assessment Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the patient’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs listed above. 8.8. Causality Assessment The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the Investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if applicable. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the Investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by the Sponsor (see Section on Reporting Requirements). If the Investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational product”, this should be clearly documented on study records. In addition, if the Investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the Investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. 8.9. Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if: 1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products). 2. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy. If a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the Investigator must submit this information to the Pfizer Drug Safety Unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form and Exposure in Utero (EIU) Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the Investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EIU Form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and it’s outcome for all EIU reports with an unknown outcome. The Investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up to the initial EIU Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for the termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise or a neonatal death]), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: • Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion; • Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the Investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product. Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the Investigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the Investigator will provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigator must document in the source documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.10. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event. An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an associated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study, the information is not reported on a CRF, however a copy of the completed SAE Report form is maintained in the investigator site file. 8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also Section Patient Withdrawal) Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page. When a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below. 8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study patient. In addition, each study patient will be questioned about AEs. 8.13. Reporting Requirements Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate. 8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements If an SAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of Investigator awareness of the event. In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information. This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of exposure during pregnancy, exposure via breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases. In the rare event that the Investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his or her first awareness of the AE. For all SAEs, the Investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above. In addition, an Investigator may be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow-up information in an expedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on the AE CRF. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications, vaccines and/or illnesses must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its designated representative. 8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF. Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information. 8.13.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. 9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by Pfizer. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 9.1. Analysis Sets 1. Safety analysis set. • The safety analysis set includes all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of study medication. 2. Full analysis set. 3. Per protocol analysis set (evaluable for DLT). • The per protocol analysis set includes all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of study medication and who do not have major treatment deviations during the first cycle. Patients with major treatment deviations in Cycle 1 are not evaluable for DLT and may be replaced. Major deviations include: • Administration of less than 75% of the planned Cycle 1 dose of either treatment in the combination (provided that the reduction is not due to toxicity attributable to both agents in the combination). • Administration of more than 125% of the planned Cycle 1 dose of either treatment in the combination. 4. PK analysis sets. • The PK parameter analysis set is defined as all enrolled patients treated who have sufficient information to estimate at least 1 of the PK parameters of interest. • Patients with a change to the planned PF-05212384 30 minute infusion time (eg, increasing to 60 minutes), will not be included in the summary statistics for PK parameters and will be listed separately. 5. Biomarker Analysis sets • Molecular profiling tumor analysis set: is defined as all enrolled patients who start treatment and have a baseline archived tumor biopsy FFPE sample (or fresh FFPE if archived is not available) successfully analyzed for at least one of the selected biomarkers. • Expression tumor analysis set: is defined as all enrolled patients who start treatment and have both baseline and on-treatment optional fresh FFPE tumor biopsy samples successfully analyzed for at least one of the selected biomarkers. • Serum PD analysis set: is defined as all enrolled patients who start treatment and have a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement for at least one serum PD biomarker. 6. Response Analysis set • All enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of study medication, have the disease under study, and an adequate baseline tumor assessment. 9.2. Statistical Methods and Properties 9.2.1. Statistical Methods for Arms A and B The MTD estimation in Arms A and B employs the mTPI method with adjustment of dose assignment criteria based on observed DLT rate.28,34 The mTPI method is a Bayesian method with only one assumption about the dose-toxicity relationship, which is, toxicity increases as dose increases. The most important parameter of the mTPI design is the target DLT rate at the MTD, which is 25% for this study. An interval for DLT rate, called equivalence interval, is also required for the mTPI method. Any DLT rate in the equivalence interval is considered sufficiently close to the target DLT rate for the purpose of MTD estimation. In this study, the equivalence interval is 20%-32%. For each dose level, the uniform prior is assumed for the DLT rate. Dose assignment recommendations are based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. Specifically, the DLT rate on (0, 1) is divided into three intervals: the equivalence interval, the interval below it, and the interval above it. Unit probability mass (UPM) is calculated for each of these intervals based on the posterior distribution of the DLT rate. The mTPI method recommends a higher dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval below the equivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current dose level; and it recommends a lower dose level to the next cohort of patients if the interval above the equivalence interval has the highest UPM at the current dose level. To protect patients from highly toxic dose levels, a dose level is considered unacceptably toxic and eliminated from further testing, if the posterior probability is 95% or higher that its DLT rate is above the target DLT rate, provided that 3 or more patients have been treated at the dose level. In addition, if the total number of patients treated at the current dose level is at least 5, then the criteria for recommending dose escalation and de-escalation will be adjusted based on the observed DLT rate at the current dose level: if it is above 32%, then dose de-escalation will be recommended; if it is below 20%, then dose escalation will be recommended, subject to the feasibility of the dose so recommended. The use of observed DLT rate for dose assignment is similar to an approach used by the local optimal interval design.34 The dose assignment recommendations for cumulative number of patients in the range of 3-15 are presented in Figure 7. At the end of dose finding, the MTD will be estimated based on isotonic regression. Specifically, the MTD estimate will be selected from the dose levels whose isotonic estimates of DLT rates are less than or equal to 32%, and it will be the dose level for which the isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If two or more dose levels share the same isotonic estimate of DLT rate, the MTD estimate will be the highest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate; and the lowest dose level in the case that the isotonic estimate is greater than the target DLT rate. Simulations of multiple scenarios for the proposed MTD finding method will be described and summarized in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). If 9 or more patients have been treated cumulatively at any dose level and the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among them, then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level, 9.2.2. Statistical Method for Arm C For Arm C, a zone-based design will be employed for MTD estimation.35 This is a 3+3 design modified for 2-dimensional MTD finding. The rule of dose assignment is described in Section 3.1.1. Table 17 shows the probability of escalating to the next dose level for a range of underlying true DLT rates. For example, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs in 10% of patients, there is a greater than 90% probability of escalating. Conversely, for a dose level at which a DLT occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is 3%. It is assumed that dose escalation occurs with either 0/3 or 1/6 patients experiencing DLTs. Table 17. Probability of Escalating Dose Level If the observed DLT rate exceeds 40% among all patients treated at the MTD (including those in the dose-escalation cohorts and expansion cohort), then enrollment will be stopped for the affected dose level, pending review of the data by the Sponsor and Investigators. 9.2.3. Statistical Method for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion Arm 1 and 2 The expansions will confirm the safety and tolerability of the dose selected as the RP2D during the dose escalation while also assessing the anti-tumor activity of PF-05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with TNBC. Enrollment of patients to a specific arm may be discontinued if no or minimal anti-tumor activity in that arm is observed during the study. 9.3. Sample Size Determination On April 1, 2015, Pfizer Inc. decided to stop enrolment in Arms A and C of the B2151002 clinical trial. Patients previously identified for enrolment in Arm A and C were permitted to enter the study after notification of the decision. Due to closure, the MTD of those combinations will not be established. All references to objectives, endpoints, study design, assessments, etc. and analysis of data in Arm A and C will be limited to the number of patients treated up to the enrolment discontinuation date for each Arm (June 10, 2015 for Arm A and 06 July 2015 for Arm C). The decision is based on the company’s change in prioritization for the portfolio and is not due to any safety/efficacy concerns or regulatory interactions. There are 3 arms in the dose escalation portion of the study. For each arm, the primary objective is to estimate the MTD. For Arms A and B, the dose escalation is with respect to PF-05212384 only. A total of 21 patients were enrolled in Arm A and approximately 40 are expected to be enrolled in Arm B. The sample size for Arm B will vary depending on the number of DLTs observed. It is expected that approximately 40 patients will be needed, however, due to the number of DLTs this may vary. For Arm C, there were 2 components prior to the April 1, 2015 decision. In the first component, patients participated in a dose escalation phase aimed at estimating the MTD. The study did not proceed to the second component and a total of 33 patients were enrolled. Sample Size Determination for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC The TNBC expansion portion of the study will enroll 30 response-evaluable patients, including 15 in Arm 1 and 2, respectively, to estimate the objective response rate (complete response (CR)+partial response (PR)). • For 1st line patients (Arm 1): • Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a 60% response rate (confirmed overall response rate (ORR): CR+PR) (9 out of 15 patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 88% that the true response is not inferior to 45%. • For 2nd/3rd-line patients (Arm 2) • Posterior Bayesian probabilities will be used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activity. For example, using a non-informative Jeffrey’s prior, a 40% response rate (confirmed ORR: CR+PR) (6 out of 15 patients) would have a posterior probability equal to 91% that the true response is not inferior to 25%. The total sample size for the study is approximately 124 patients. 9.4. Efficacy Analysis 9.4.1. Efficacy Analysis for the Dose Escalation In the dose escalation portion of the study, anti-tumor activity is a secondary objective. Tumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not limited to, tumor type, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. In addition, dates of progression, death, first response and last tumor assessment will be listed. If the data permits, objective response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be provided by arm and by tumor type. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical benefit response includes PR, CR and SD (≥24 weeks from the first dose to treatment failure). 9.4.2. Efficacy Analysis for the Safety and Efficacy Expansion in TNBC In the expansion portion of the study, objective response is the primary endpoint. Objective response rate, clinical benefit response rate, duration of response (DOR), and PFS will be calculated for expansion Arm 1 and 2. Objective response includes CR and PR. Clinical benefit response (CBR) includes CR, PR and SD (≥24 weeks from first dose to treatment failure). DOR is calculated from first date of PR or CR to the date of progression or death due to any cause. In the event of no progression or death, the last tumor assessment date without progression will be used in this calculation. PFS is defined as the time from first dose to date of first documentation of progression or death due to any cause. Details of censoring for PFS will be provided in the SAP. The posterior probabilities used to assess the probabilities of anti-tumor activity will be calculated based on the final number of responders and response-evaluable patients. Tumor response will be presented in the form of patient data listings that include, but are not limited to, starting dose, tumor response at each visit, and best overall response. In addition, dates of progression, death, first response, and last tumor assessment will be listed. 9.5. Analysis of Other Endpoints 9.5.1. Analysis of Single- and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetics Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters including the maximum plasma concentration (C ), max time to maximum plasma concentration (T ), and area under the plasma concentration max versus time curve (AUC , AUC ) for PF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib last τ will be estimated using non-compartmental analysis. If data permit or if considered appropriate, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC ), inf terminal elimination half-life (t ), plasma clearance (CL), apparent volume of distribution V , ½ d accumulation ratio (R ) and linearity ratio (R ) will also be estimated. The single dose and ac ss steady-state PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by dose, cycle and day. For PF-05212384, docetaxel, cisplatin and dacomitinib concentrations will be summarized descriptively (n, mean, SD, percent coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and its associated CV) by dose, cycle, day and nominal time. Individual patient and median profiles of the concentration-time data will be plotted by dose, cycle and day (single dose and steady-state) using nominal times. Median profiles will be presented on both linear-linear and log-linear scales. The observed accumulation ratio and the linearity ratio will be summarized descriptively. Each will be analyzed after natural log transformation using a one-way analysis of variance with a single term for dose. The means and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained from the model will be back-transformed to provide means and 90% CIs for the accumulation and linearity ratios for each dose. Trough concentrations will be plotted for each dose using a box-whisker plot by cycle and day within cycle in order to assess the attainment of steady-state. 9.5.1.1. Metabolite Profiling Plasma metabolite profiling will be summarized in a separate report and not included in the clinical study report (CSR). 9.5.2. Statistical Analysis of Biomarkers For biopsy samples, summary statistics (eg, the mean and standard deviation, median, CV, and minimum/maximum levels of continuous, and frequency and percentages of categorical biomarker measures) will be determined at baseline and post-treatment for each arm. For each pair of specimens, the ratio-to-baseline of these same parameters will also be calculated. Data from biomarker assays may be analyzed using graphical methods and descriptive statistics such as Wilcoxan rank sum, linear regression, t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The statistical approach may examine correlations of biomarker results with pharmacokinetic parameters and measures of anti-tumor efficacy. Graphics may be provided as appropriate. 9.6. Safety Analysis Summaries and analyses of safety parameters will include all patients in the safety analysis set. 9.6.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is the primary endpoint of the dose escalation portion of the study. The occurrence of DLTs observed in the dosing cohorts is used to estimate the MTD as described in Section 3.3. The number of patients with DLTs will be listed by dosing cohort as well as by dose level for each arm. Adverse Events constituting DLTs will be listed per dose level by arm. 9.6.2. Analysis of Secondary Safety Endpoints 9.6.2.1. Adverse Events Adverse Events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigator according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version # 4.03 and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The focus of AE summaries, which will be by arm, will be on Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study medication. The number and percentage of patients who experienced any AE, serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE, and treatment related SAE will be summarized according to worst toxicity grades. The summaries will present AEs both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle 1 and Cycles beyond 1). 9.6.2.2. Laboratory Tests Abnormalities The number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be summarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assay by arm. The analyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle (Lead-in, Cycle 1 and Cycles beyond 1). For laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal, abnormal or not done. 9.6.2.3. Electrocardiogram Assessments The analysis of ECG results will be based on patients in the safety analysis set who have both baseline and on-treatment ECG data. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate measurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data obtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be averaged with the preceding triplicates. Interval measurements from repeated ECGs will be included in the outlier analysis (categorical analysis) as individual values obtained at unscheduled time points. QT intervals will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using standard correction factors (ie, Fredericia’s and possibly other factors). The adequacy of the correction method may be assessed graphically (plots of QT and QTc versus RR) and supplementary transformations may be considered, as appropriate. Data will be summarized and listed for QT, HR, RR, PR, QRS, and QTcF by arm, dose, and time. The most appropriate correction factor will be selected and used for the following analyses of central tendency and outliers and used for the study conclusions. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be used to summarize the baseline QTc values and changes from baseline in QTc by arm, dose, and time point. For each patient and by arm, the maximum change from baseline will be calculated as well as the maximum post-baseline value across time-points. Categorical analysis of the QTc data will be conducted on maximum change from baseline in QTc and maximum post-baseline QTc. Shift tables will be provided for baseline vs. worst on treatment QTc using the maximum CTC AE Grade. Shift tables will also be provided for ECG abnormality on treatment vs baseline (yes, no, not done: (n, %)). The effect of drug concentrations on QTc interval changes from baseline will be explored graphically. Additional concentration-QTc analyses may be performed. Data may be pooled with other study results and/or explored further with PK/PD models. 9.7. Patient Reported Outcomes The number and percentage of patients who complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 will be summarized in a table, as will the reasons for non-completion of these measures. The mean change of absolute global QOL scores from baseline (and 95% CI) will be calculated. Repeated measures mixed model analyses will also be conducted to estimate changes in scores over time. The number and proportion of patients who improved, and single items of the QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-BR23 will be summarized in a table. Analyses will be performed to determine if the change from baseline scores achieve the appropriate minimally important difference (MID) cut-off for the scale being examined. In addition to the above analyses, an examination of the time to deterioration (TTD) for global QOL will be carried out using survival analysis methods. 9.8. Data Safety Monitoring Committee An external Data Safety Monitoring Committee will not be established for the study. For the purpose of this protocol, Pfizer procedures for periodic safety review will be applied by an internal safety review team with medical and statistical capabilities to review individual and summary data collected in the safety and clinical databases. This will include surveillance for SAEs according to regulatory guidelines. Discussions between the Investigators and the Sponsor regarding AEs and laboratory test abnormalities seen at each dose level will occur in an on-going manner at regular teleconferences and/or meetings to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and determine if further patient enrollment is appropriate. 10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE During study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The Investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. The study site may be subject to review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/IEC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. It is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Records As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study. A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient. The completed original CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The CRFs must be signed by the Investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry. In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the physician’s patient chart. In these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents. In these cases, a document should be available at the Investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be retained by the Investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. If the Investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another Investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. The Investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met. 12. ETHICS 12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File. Copies of IRB/IEC approvals should The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients. In that event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation. 12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996, 2008). In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH guideline on GCP, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. 12.3. Patient Information and Consent All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names on any Sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any other disclosures, except where required by laws. Patient names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical code consisting of a numbering system provided by Pfizer in order to de-identify the trial patient. In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of patient personal data. The informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements. The informed consent document used during the informed consent process must be reviewed by the Sponsor, approved by both the IRB/IEC and available for inspection. The Investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his/her legal representative, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation. The Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each patient or the patient's legal representative before any study-specific activity is performed. The Investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed consent document. 12.4. Patient Recruitment Advertisements approved by IEC and Investigator databases may be used as recruitment procedures. 12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable Competent Authority in any area of the World, or if the Investigator is aware of any new information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. In addition, the Investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures taken by the Investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the Investigator becomes aware of. 13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL 13.1. End of Trial in a Member State End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is deemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the regulatory application (ie, Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the Member State. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) by a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal conclusion to the study in that Member State. 13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries The End of Trial in all participating countries is defined as the Last Patient Last Visit (LPLV). 14. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-05212384 at any time. If a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the Investigator. After notification, the Investigator must contact all participating patients and the hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within a 4 week time period. As directed by Pfizer, all study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible. 15. PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS 15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trial Database (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with applicable local laws/regulations. In all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and complete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in which the study was conducted. www.clinicaltrials.gov Pfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies conducted in patients that evaluate safety and/or efficacy of a Pfizer product regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted. US Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary completion date for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the primary completion date for studies in pediatric populations. Primary Completion Date is defined as the date that the final patient was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary outcome, whether the clinical study concluded according to the pre-specified protocol or was terminated. EudraCT Pfizer posts EU Basic Results on EudraCT for all Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies that are in scope of EU requirements. EU Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary completion date for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the primary completion date for studies in pediatric populations. www.pfizer.com Pfizer posts Public Disclosure Synopses (clinical study report synopses in which any data that could be used to identify individual patients has been removed) on www.pfizer.com for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies at the same time the US Basic Results document is posted to www.clinicaltrials.gov. 15.2. Publications by Investigators Pfizer has no objection to publication by Investigator of any information collected or generated by Investigator, whether or not the results are favorable to the Investigational Drug. However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of Confidential Information or unprotected Inventions, Investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity to review any proposed publication or other type of disclosure before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed. Investigator will provide manuscripts, abstracts, or the full text of any other intended disclosure (poster presentation, invited speaker or guest lecturer presentation, etc) to Pfizer at least 30 days before they are submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed. If any patent action is required to protect intellectual property rights, Investigator agrees to delay the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days. Investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed Confidential Information (other than the study results themselves) before disclosure. If the study is part of a multi-centre study, Investigator agrees that the first publication is to be a joint publication covering all centers. However, if a joint manuscript has not been submitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the study at all participating sites, Investigator is free to publish separately, subject to the other requirements of this Section. For all publications relating to the study, Institution will comply with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II - “Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.

CATEGORIZING LESIONS AT BASELINE Measurable Lesions Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension. • Lesions with longest diameter twice the slice thickness and at least 10 mm or greater when assessed by CT or MRI (slice thickness 5-8 mm). • Lesions with longest diameter at least 20 mm when assessed by Chest X-ray. • Superficial lesions with longest diameter 10 mm or greater when assessed by caliper. • Malignant lymph nodes with the short axis 15 mm or greater when assessed by CT. NOTE: The shortest axis is used as the diameter for malignant lymph nodes, longest axis for all other measurable lesions. Non-measurable disease Non-measurable disease includes lesions too small to be considered measurable (including nodes with short axis between 10 and 14.9 mm) and truly non-measurable disease such as pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, leptomeningeal disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, clinical lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers, abdominal masses identified by physical exam that are not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. • Bone disease: Bone disease is non-measurable with the exception of soft tissue components that can be evaluated by CT or MRI and meet the definition of measurability at baseline. • Previous local treatment: A previously irradiated lesion (or lesion patiented to other local treatment) is non-measurable unless it has progressed since completion of treatment. Normal sites • Cystic lesions: Simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions and should not be recorded either as target or non-target disease. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be measurable lesions, if they meet the specific definition above. If non-cystic lesions are also present, these are preferred as target • Normal nodes: Nodes with short axis <10 mm are considered normal and should not be recorded or followed either as measurable or non-measurable disease. Recording Tumor Assessments All sites of disease must be assessed at baseline. Baseline assessments should be done as close as possible prior to study start. For an adequate baseline assessment, all required scans must be done within 28 days prior to treatment and all disease must be documented appropriately. If baseline assessment is inadequate, subsequent statuses generally should be indeterminate. Target lesions All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability for accurate repeated measurements. Record the longest diameter for each lesion, except in the case of pathological lymph nodes for which the short axis should be recorded. The sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions at baseline will be the basis for comparison to assessments performed on study. • If two target lesions coalesce the measurement of the coalesced mass is used. If a large target lesion splits, the sum of the parts is used. • Measurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be recorded. If a target lesion becomes too small to measure, 0 mm should be recorded if the lesion is considered to have disappeared; otherwise a default value of 5 mm should be recorded. NOTE: When nodal lesions decrease to <10 mm (normal), the actual measurement should still be recorded. Non-target disease All non-measurable disease is non-target. All measurable lesions not identified as target lesions are also included as non-target disease. Measurements are not required but rather assessments will be expressed as ABSENT, INDETERMINATE, PRESENT/NOT INCREASED, INCREASED. Multiple non-target lesions in one organ may be recorded as a single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’). OBJECTIVE RESPONSE STATUS AT EACH EVALUATION. Disease sites must be assessed using the same technique as baseline, including consistent administration of contrast and timing of scanning. If a change needs to be made the case must be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution is possible. If not, Target disease • Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis <10 mm). All target lesions must be assessed. • Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The short diameter is used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is used in the sum for all other target lesions. All target lesions must be assessed. • Stable: Does not qualify for CR, PR or Progression. All target lesions must be assessed. Stable can follow PR only in the rare case that the sum increases by less than 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously documented 30% decrease no longer holds. • Objective Progression (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum is observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. • Indeterminate. Progression has not been documented, and • one or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed. • or assessment methods used were inconsistent with those used at baseline. • or one or more target lesions cannot be measured accurately (eg, poorly visible unless due to being too small to measure). • or one or more target lesions were excised or irradiated and have not reappeared or increased. Non-target disease • CR: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. All lymph nodes must be ‘normal’ in size (<10 mm short axis). • Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits. • PD: Unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions. Generally the overall tumor burden must increase sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. In the presence of SD or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal increase in non-target disease should be rare. • Indeterminate: Progression has not been determined and one or more non-target sites were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at baseline. New Lesions The appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesion indicates PD. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example due to its small size, continued assessment will clarify the etiology. If repeat assessments confirm the lesion, then progression should be recorded on the date of the initial assessment. A lesion identified in an area not previously scanned will be considered a new lesion. Supplemental Investigations • If CR determination depends on a residual lesion that decreased in size but did not disappear completely, it is recommended the residual lesion be investigated with biopsy or fine needle aspirate. If no disease is identified, objective status is CR. • If progression determination depends on a lesion with an increase possibly due to necrosis, the lesion may be investigated with biopsy or fine needle aspirate to clarify status. Subjective progression Patients requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression should not be reported as PD on tumor assessment CRFs. This should be indicated on the end of treatment CRF as off treatment due to Global Deterioration of Health Status. Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. If the protocol allows enrollment of patients with only non-target disease, the following table will be used: Appendix 3.

Guidelines for Management of Hyperglycemia with PF-05212384 In clinical trials, PF-05212384 has been shown to have metabolic effects including hyperglycemia. The following guidelines are provided in an attempt to briefly inform Investigators as to the potential evaluation and treatments to be considered, and to attempt to standardize approaches to therapy. These guidelines are not meant to replace institutional practices. On-study hyperglycemia management • Patients with HbA1c ≥5.7%- home monitoring at least QD. • Fasting blood glucose (FBG) assessed at every visit. • Repeat FBG in 1 week if ≥200 mg/dL. Management¥ therapy*Contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency. ¥ Discontinue oral anti-hyperglycemics and monitor for hypoglycemia when study drug is interrupted for lengthy periods or is discontinued. ** Short acting agents (eg, repaglinide). § Symptoms such as, but not limited to hypotension, severe dehydration, severe metabolic abnormalities Appendix 6. Skin Toxicity Management with PF-05212384 In clinical studies, PF-05212384 has been shown to induce skin toxicities including rash and pruritis. The following guidelines are provided in an attempt to briefly inform Investigators as to the potential evaluation and treatments to be considered, and to attempt to standardize approaches to therapy. These guidelines are not meant to replace institutional practices. The following charts may be used as a guide in determining %BSA when assessing the severity of rash.

Abbreviations: BSA: Body Surface Area ADL: Activities of Daily Living. • Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. • Self care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications and not bedridden. (Definitions per CTCAEv4). GABA: gamma-Aminobutyric Acid DIARRHEA • Patients should be encouraged to drink 8 to 10 large glasses of clear liquids per day while on study in order to maintain adequate hydration. • General dietary measures to limit impact of diarrhea could include: • Stop all lactose-containing products in patients with evidence of lactose intolerance; • Eat frequent small meals if experiencing increased frequency of stools; • Consider low fat regimen enriched with bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. Diarrhea Management Guideline DERMATOLOGIC TOXICITY Acneiform/ Papulopustular Rash: Dry Skin/ Xerosis: Prophylaxis against dry skin would include: • Initiation of skin moisturizing cream or ointment regimen upon establishment of eligibility (ie prior to first dose). (avoid skin lotions, as they may contain alcohol). • Avoidance of excessive exposure to hot water during showering/bathing. • Avoidance of household tasks involving immersion in hot water/ detergent/ solvents. • Avoidance of excessive sun exposure/tanning. Use sunscreen containing zinc oxide or titatinium dioxide with SPF at least 30: apply every two hours when exposed to sun. Paronychia: Pruritis/Itching: Prophylaxis against dry skin would include: • Initiation of skin moisturizing regimen prior to first dose. Non-scented emollient skin cream should be used; • Avoidance of excessive exposure to hot water during showering/bathing; • Avoidance of household tasks involving immersion in hot water/ detergent/ solvents; • Avoidance of excessive sun exposure/ tanning. Use sunscreen containing zinc oxide or titatinium dioxide with SPF at least 30: apply every two hours when sun exposure is anticipated. MUCOSITIS Patients who have not had a dental check up within 6 months prior to start of dosing are encouraged to do so, especially to identify any persistent issue related to recent chemotherapy. Once on treatment, patients are to consult the site health care team prior to undertaking any dental or oral surgery procedure to determine if it would be appropriate to proceed depending on presence of any ongoing mucosal inflammation/ stomatitis. Between scheduled visits, patient self-report of oral mucosal discomfort or of visible changes in appearance to oral mucosa is encouraged. Periodic systematic examination of the oral cavity is required at scheduled visits and as otherwise indicated by patient self-report between visits. Patients should practice good oral care including a soft-bristle toothbrush replaced frequently and use of bland rinses or moisturizers. Regular use of warm water non-medicated saline rinse is recommended if stomatitis develops. Frequent sips of water during meals may assist swallowing and therefore maintain caloric intake and hydration in patients experiencing oral pain Use of chlorhexidine is to be avoided. Topical anesthetics or systemic analgesics may be used as indicated in judgment of the Investigator and according to local clinical practices. Topical steroid rinses have been reported to be helpful in severe cases (eg dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 ml swish and expectorate four times daily). Consultation with nutritionist is to be considered if toxicity may compromise maintenance of adequate caloric intake. Keratoconjunctivitis Grade 3: Preservative free artificial tears, ointments, and/or other therapies as clinically indicated, with a Limiting self care ADL follow-up examination within 2 weeks to include slit-lamp and fundoscopic exam as per the Investigator judgment. Study Treatment: Drug should be withheld until recovers to≤ Grade 1 and then reduce one dose PULMONARY TOXICITY In the event of new onset of dyspnea, persistent cough, or other pulmonary symptoms, treatment with either drug should be stopped until patient can be adequately evaluated for possible development of drug related interstitial lung disease; dose modification is not appropriate in this setting. Patients should be counseled throughout treatment to alert investigator or designated team member immediately if they develop new or worsening respiratory symptoms. If following discussion between the sponsor and the investigator it is concluded that a thorough investigation has excluded treatment-induced pulmonary toxicity, and less than 2 weeks have elapsed off treatment, treatment may resume. Appendix 8. CYP2D6 Substrates For CYP2D6 substrates, prohibited drugs and drugs for which substitution, dose modification and/or monitoring is advised are listed below. This listing is not an all inclusive list, and will be monitored by Sponsor study team for required updates (addition, deletion) but in all instances Investigators should review potential for drug-drug interaction for concomitant medications and take appropriate measures of substitution or dose modification. CODE DRUG THERAPEUTIC CLASS CODE DRUG THERAPEUTIC CLASS Appendix 9. Management of Allergic Reactions or Anaphylaxis In the event of allergic, infusion or hypersensitivity reactions, investigators should institute treatment measures according to best medical and nursing practice. The following treatment guidelines should be employed: If chills and fever occur, the infusion should be interrupted. Patients may be treated symptomatically and the infusion should be restarted at 50% of the original rate. NCI-CTCAE Grade 1 allergic, infusion or hypersensitivity reaction 1. Decrease PF-05212384 infusion rate by 50% and monitor for worsening condition. If the reaction worsens, stop the infusion. Protocol treatment will be discontinued. NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 allergic, infustion or hypersensitivity reaction 1. Stop PF-05212384 infusion. 2. Administer bronchodilators, oxygen, acetaminophen, etc. as medically indicated. 3. Resume infusion at 50% of previous rate once reaction has decreased to ≤ Grade 1 in severity. Monitor closely for any worsening. If the reaction recurs, stop infusion. Protocol treatment will be discontinued. NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic, infusion or hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis 1. A Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction consists of symptomatic bronchospasm requiring parenteral medications with or without urticaria, allergy-related edema/angioedema, or asymptomatic hypotension not requiring treatment. 2. A Grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction (ie, anaphylaxis) is a life-threatening event characterized by the same symptoms as in a Grade 3 reaction but also complicated by symptomatic hypotension or oxygen saturation of 70% or less. Treatment of Grade 3 or Grade 4 allergic, infustion or hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis 1. Stop the PF-05212384 infusion immediately and disconnect infusion tubing from the patient. 2. Administer epinephrine, bronchodilators, antihistamines, glucocorticoids, intravenous fluids, vasopressor agents, oxygen, etc. as medically indicated. 3. Telephone Sponsor or designated representative to report an SAE and fax SAE worksheet. For a NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reaction, protocol treatment will be discontinued. Re-treatment following Grade 1 or Grade 2 allergic, infustion or hypersensitivity reaction 1. Once the PF-05212384 infusion rate has been decreased due to a reaction, it will remain decreased for all subsequent infusions. 2. If the patient has a second reaction at the lower infusion rate, the infusion should be stopped and the patient should receive no further PF-05212384. 3. If the patient experiences a Grade 3 or 4 allergic reactionor anaphylaxis at any time, the patient should receive no further PF-05212384. 4. If there are questions concerning whether an observed reaction is consistent with an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, the medical monitor should be contacted immediately to assist with grading the reaction. PK and PD sampling should continue as long as the sampling does not interfere with the medical treatment of the patient.  (cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:44) Appendix 11. BR23 English
