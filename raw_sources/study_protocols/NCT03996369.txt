Document Amendment Type Date Sponsor: Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Study design: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod 2 mg in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. The study consists of a 28-Day Screening Period, a 12-Week Induction Treatment Period, and a 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up Period. The target subject population will include (approximately 50% of subjects in each of the following categories): 1. Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to conventional therapy and are naïve to biologic or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy 2. Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to a biologic or JAK inhibitor (subjects in this category may have received prior conventional therapy). Subject eligibility will be determined during a 4-Week (28-Day) Screening Period. Entry criteria will be based on confirmation of moderately to severely active UC, defined by a modified Mayo score (MMS) of 4 to 9, which includes an endoscopic score (ES) ≥ 2 and rectal bleeding (RB) score ≥ 1. or matching placebo (once daily) in a double-blind fashion for 12 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by (a) naïve to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy at study entry (yes or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and (c) baseline disease activity (MMS: 4 to 6 or 7 to 9). At the end of the 12-Week Induction Treatment Period, subjects will undergo the Week 12 study assessments. Subjects will then have the option to enter an open-label extension (OLE) study (APD334-303) following completion of Week 12 study procedures provided they meet all eligibility criteria for the OLE. Subjects must complete Week 12 to be eligible for the OLE. Subjects who do not participate in the OLE study will have 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up visits after the last treatment administration. Number of subjects (planned): Approximately 330 subjects are planned to be enrolled into this study. Eligibility criteria: Inclusion criteria: Subjects must meet ALL of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study: 1. Men or women 16 to 80 years of age, inclusive, at the time of assent/consent. Enrollment of subjects < 18 years should be conducted only if acceptable according to local laws and regulations 2. Ability to provide written informed consent or assent (parent or legal guardian must provide consent for a subject < 18 years of age who has assented to participate in the study or as required per local regulations) and to be compliant with the schedule of protocol assessments Disease-specific inclusion criteria: 3. Diagnosed with UC ≥ 3 months prior to screening. The diagnosis of UC must be confirmed by endoscopic and histologic evidence. The endoscopy and histology report should be present in the source documents; however, if not available, the screening endoscopy and histology may serve as such 4. Active UC confirmed by endoscopy with ≥ 10 cm rectal involvement. Subjects with proctitis only at baseline who meet the other eligibility criteria for inclusion, including the endoscopic and rectal bleeding criteria for moderate to severe disease, will be capped at 15% of the total subjects enrolled 5. Moderately to severely active UC defined as MMS of 4 to 9, including an ES of ≥ 2 and RB score ≥ 1 6. Received a surveillance colonoscopy (performed according to local standard) within 12 months before baseline to rule out dysplasia in subjects with pancolitis > 8 years duration or subjects with left-sided colitis > 12 years duration. Subjects without a surveillance colonoscopy within the prior 12 months will have a colonoscopy at screening (ie, in place of screening proctosigmoidoscopy). Any adenomatous polyps must be removed according to routine practice prior to their first dose of study treatment. 7. Demonstrated an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to at least 1 of the following therapies as defined below: Conventional therapy a. Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds b. Corticosteroids c. Thiopurines Biologic therapy or JAK inhibitor therapy a. Antitumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) antibodies (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, or biosimilars) b. Anti-integrin antibodies (eg, vedolizumab) c. Anti-interleukin 12/23 antibodies (eg, ustekinumab) d. JAK inhibitors (eg, tofacitinib) Note: The medication used to qualify the subject for entry into this category must be approved for the treatment of UC in the country of use and the subject must have received an adequate course of therapy based on local guidelines for that therapy. Concomitant treatments: 8. Subjects are permitted to be receiving a therapeutic dose of the following drugs: • Oral 5-ASA compounds provided the dose has been stable for ≥ 2 weeks immediately prior to randomization • Oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone at a stable dose ≤ 20 mg/day, budesonide at a stable dose ≤ 9 mg/day, or equivalent steroid) provided the dose has been stable for the 4 weeks immediately prior to the screening endoscopy assessment • Immunosuppressive agents such as oral azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine must be discontinued ≥ 2 weeks prior to randomization • Probiotics (eg, Culturelle®, Saccharomyces boulardii) provided the dose has been stable for the 2 weeks immediately prior to randomization If oral 5-ASA or corticosteroids have been recently discontinued, they must have been stopped for at least 2 weeks prior to the endoscopy used for the baseline MMS.

The MMS is a composite of 3 assessments, each rated from 0 to 3: stool frequency (SF), RB, and ES. The ES • Clinical remission: SF subscore = 0 (or = 1 with a ≥ 1-point decrease from baseline), RB subscore = 0, and ES ≤ 1 (excluding friability) • Endoscopic improvement: ES ≤ 1 (excluding friability) • Mucosal healing: ES ≤ 1 (excluding friability) with histologic remission measured by a Geboes Index score < 2.0 • Symptomatic remission: SF subscore = 0 (or = 1 with a ≥ 1-point decrease from baseline) and RB subscore = 0 Primary efficacy endpoint: • The proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission at Week 12 Key secondary efficacy endpoints: • The proportion of subjects achieving endoscopic improvement at Week 12 • The proportion of subjects achieving symptomatic remission at Week 12 • The proportion of subjects with mucosal healing at Week 12 Pharmacokinetic assessments: Plasma concentrations of etrasimod, and if warranted M3 (AR503641) and other metabolite(s) of interest, will be assessed from samples collected pre-dose and 4 hours post-dose (after 12-lead ECG) on Week 0/Day 1, and pre-dose (trough) at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and at the 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up visits. A PK sample should also be drawn, if possible, at the time of any SAE or adverse event leading to study treatment discontinuation. Plasma PK samples may also be used for profiling of drug binding proteins, bioanalytical method validation purposes, stability assessments, metabolite assessments, or to assess other actions of etrasimod with plasma constituents. Other assessments: Biomarker endpoints: • Change from baseline in level of fecal calprotectin at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 • Change from baseline in level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 • Change and percentage change from baseline in lymphocyte counts at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 Health-related quality of life endpoints: • Scores and change from baseline at Week 12 for the following: − Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire total score (IBDQ) − Ulcerative Colitis Patient-Reported Outcomes Signs and Symptoms (UC-PRO/SS) − Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 2 physical and mental component and domain scores (SF-36) − Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire – Ulcerative Colitis (WPAI-UC) − Urgency numeric rating scale (NRS) • The proportion of subjects with UC-related hospitalizations • The proportion of subjects requiring UC-related surgeries, including colectomy Safety assessments: Safety will be assessed using monitoring of adverse events, clinical laboratory findings, 12-lead ECGs, physical examinations, vital signs, pulmonary function tests, ophthalmoscopy, and optical coherence tomography. Safety endpoints: • Incidence and severity of adverse events • Incidence and severity of laboratory abnormalities, and change from baseline in laboratory values (to include hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis) • Incidence of clinically significant vital sign abnormalities and changes from baseline Statistical methods: Sample size Based on a 2-group Fischer’s exact test, a 1-sided significance level of 0.025, and a 2:1 randomization ratio, at least 330 total subjects (220 etrasimod, 110 placebo) are required to achieve at least 90% power to detect a difference of 12.5% in the primary endpoint of clinical remission between the etrasimod treatment group (18.5%) and the placebo treatment group (6.0%). Efficacy analysis The primary analysis of the proportion-based efficacy endpoints will be carried out using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method, stratified by (a) naïve to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy at study entry (yes or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and (c) baseline disease activity (MMS: 4 to 6 or 7 to 9). Results will be expressed as the number of subjects in remission, remission percentages, difference in remission percentages, odds ratio, and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. Testing strategy There are multiple null hypotheses for the comparison of etrasimod and placebo in the primary and key secondary endpoints. The family-wise type-I error rate will be controlled at a fixed α level at 0.025 (1-sided) using the following testing procedure. First, the whole α will be spent on testing the primary endpoint. Only if the primary null hypothesis is rejected at the α level, can testing proceed for the 3 key secondary endpoints. The method for such testing will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), and it will control for the multiplicity of the 3 key secondary endpoints. Any key secondary endpoint that fails to be significant at the α level by this method to control multiplicity will be considered exploratory and thereby would only have nominal p-values. All other endpoints will be evaluated at α level of significance and reported with nominal p-values, without multiplicity adjustment. Pharmacokinetic analysis A descriptive summary of observed plasma concentration will be displayed by time and by treatment group. The Safety Set will be used to analyze plasma levels. All safety data will be listed and summarized by treatment group. All treatment-emergent adverse events will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and tabulated by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be summarized and presented in descending order of frequency. Associated laboratory parameters such as hepatic enzymes, renal function, and hematology values will be grouped and presented together. Individual subject values will be listed and values outside of the standard reference range will be flagged. Shift tables and analyses of changes from baseline will be produced.

Ulcerative Colitis Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) describes conditions with chronic or recurring immune response and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract There are 2 major types of IBD: Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These are chronic recurrent, remittent, or progressive inflammatory conditions that may affect the entire gastrointestinal tract (CD) and the colonic mucosa (UC), and are associated with an increased risk for colon cancer (Kaser 2010). Ulcerative colitis is characterized by diffuse mucosal inflammation limited to the colon and involves the rectum in approximately 95% of cases and may extend proximally in a symmetrical, circumferential, and uninterrupted pattern to involve parts or all of the large intestine (Kornbluth 2010). Symptoms for UC can vary, depending on the location and severity of inflammation, but some of the most common are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and rectal bleeding. The hallmark clinical symptom is bloody diarrhea often with prominent symptoms of rectal urgency and tenesmus (Kornbluth 2010). Treatment for subjects with UC is generally for symptomatic care (relief of symptoms) and mucosal healing and includes 5 major classes of medications: 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologic therapies (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors and anti-integrins) and most recently Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy. These drugs may be prescribed in a “step-up” approach, with escalation of the medical regimen until a response is achieved, or a “step-down” manner, with initiation of treatment with biologics and immunomodulators (Rowe 2020). An unmet medical need exists for the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of UC with easily administered and stable oral drugs, particularly as most patients treated with biologics experience inadequate responses. Moreover, many patients who receive biologics lose responsiveness over time, even though their initial response may have been positive (Ungar 2016). 1.2. Etrasimod Etrasimod (APD334) is an orally administered, selective, synthetic sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1, 4, 5 modulator that is being developed to treat immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, including UC. The S1P is a cell surface expressed protein that has been shown to regulate lymphocyte 1 migration out of lymphoid tissues (Brinkmann 2010). Synthetic small-molecule S1P agonists 1 have been observed to act as functional antagonists by inducing sustained receptor internalization, thus inhibiting lymphocyte migration out of lymphoid tissues and lowering the amount of peripheral blood lymphocytes available to be recruited to sites of inflammation. Modulation of the S1P/S1P receptor axis is thought to be a potential therapeutic approach to the management of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (Nielsen 2017); as such, etrasimod is expected to potentially provide therapeutic benefit to patients with UC. A Phase 2 study with etrasimod in subjects with moderately to severely active UC demonstrated consistent and clinically meaningful improvements in endpoint measures reflecting cardinal symptoms of UC relevant to the investigational product and its study in human subjects. 1.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment Considering the significant unmet need for safe and effective, orally administered treatments for UC, etrasimod may potentially provide therapeutic benefit via S1P receptor modulation. Adverse events that have been reported with S1P receptor modulators include bradycardia at the first dose or atrioventricular (AV) block, macular edema, hypertension, headache, cough, dyspnea, back pain, influenza, and diarrhea. Safety and tolerability of etrasimod has been evaluated in Phase 1 studies with healthy adult subjects at single doses up to 5 mg and repeat doses up to 4 mg once daily. Repeated doses of 2 mg have been evaluated in Phase 2 studies of subjects with moderately to severely active UC (refer to the current edition of the IB). Etrasimod was found to be safe and well tolerated in these studies, with no clinically significant safety concerns with respect to vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), pulmonary function tests (PFTs), ophthalmoscopy, or clinical laboratory tests. Etrasimod produced a dose-dependent sustained decrease in total lymphocyte count, which is expected given etrasimod’s mechanism of action. Lymphocyte counts were within normal limits by 7 days after the last dose. Detailed information regarding the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected adverse events of etrasimod can be found in the IB. Based on the mechanism of action of etrasimod and prior experience with other agents acting via a similar mechanism, monitoring for specific safety parameters are planned for this study, which include: auscultation of the lungs as part of the physical exam; PFT, exclusion of subjects with macular edema or retinopathy, with assessment of optical coherence tomography (OCT) occurring throughout the study; and exclusion of subjects with certain cardiac risks, with assessment of vital signs in the period following dosing. • Auscultation of lungs will be conducted as part of the physical examination. • Prospective subjects with a history of macular edema or retinopathy will be excluded from the study. All randomized subjects will be assessed by OCT at study entry, periodically throughout the treatment period, and as clinically indicated any time during the study. • Subjects with certain cardiac risks will also be excluded from the study. Randomized subjects will be monitored in a period following dosing, and vital signs will be assessed for determination of the subject’s health before discharge. Subjects requiring follow-up monitoring will be evaluated in the clinic until cardiac variances return to acceptable levels. Based on the preclinical and clinical data that has been generated from etrasimod studies and the precautions outlined above, the favorable benefit/risk assessment justifies the further clinical development of etrasimod in subjects with moderately to severely active UC and the current Phase 3 study. to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. At the completion of the study (completion of Week 12 assessments), subjects will have the opportunity to enroll into an open-label extension (OLE) study that will provide additional information on the long-term efficacy and safety of etrasimod. The results from this study will be used to support the regulatory approval of etrasimod for the treatment of patients with UC. 2.1. Primary Objective The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of etrasimod when administered for 12 weeks on clinical remission in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. 2.2. Secondary Objective The secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of etrasimod when administered for 12 weeks on clinical response, symptomatic response and remission, endoscopic changes, and mucosal healing in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. 2.3. Safety Objective The safety objective is to assess the safety of etrasimod after daily doses of 2 mg for 12 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. 2.4. Other Objectives Other objectives include evaluation of etrasimod pharmacokinetics (PK) and the effect of etrasimod on health-related subject-reported outcomes and biomarkers. 3.1. Summary of Study Design This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod 2 mg in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. The study consists of a 28-day Screening Period, a 12-Week Induction Treatment Period, and a 4-Week Follow-Up Period (Figure 1). Eligible subjects will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either etrasimod (2 mg once daily) or matching placebo (once daily) in a double-blind fashion for 12 weeks of induction treatment. Randomization will be stratified by (a) naïve to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy at study entry (yes or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and (c) baseline disease activity (modified Mayo score [MMS]: 4 to 6 or 7 to 9). The target subject population will include (approximately 50% of subjects in each of the following categories): 2. Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to conventional therapy and are naïve to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy. 3. Subjects who have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to a biologic or JAK inhibitor (subjects in this category may have received prior conventional therapy). Subject eligibility will be determined during a 4-Week (28-Day) Screening Period. Entry criteria will be based on confirmation of moderately to severely active UC, defined by an MMS of 4 to 9, which includes an endoscopic score (ES) ≥ 2 and rectal bleeding (RB) score ≥ 1. At the end of the 12-Week Induction Treatment Period, subjects will undergo Week 12 efficacy and safety assessments and be evaluated for clinical response/remission. Subjects will then have the option to enter an OLE study (APD334-303) following completion of Week 12 study procedures and provided they meet all eligibility criteria for the OLE. Subjects must complete Week 12 to be eligible for the OLE. Subjects who discontinue from the study and do not participate in the OLE study will have 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up visits after their last treatment administration/Early Termination (ET) visit (Table 7). JAK, Janus kinase 3.2. Rationale for Study Design This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Subjects may continue existing nonbiologic therapy for UC (eg, 5-ASA, corticosteroids) per the concomitant medication and dose stabilization criteria. As preexisting background therapy is allowed, a placebo comparator is justified. The 12-Week Induction Treatment Period is based on the safety and efficacy findings of the Phase 2 APD334-002 placebo-controlled study. The 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up visits will provide off-treatment safety information. The etrasimod dose of 2 mg once daily is based on findings of previous Phase 1 and 2 studies, and in particular data from the Phase 2 APD334-003 placebo-controlled study . In the APD334-003 study, subjects received etrasimod 1 mg, etrasimod 2 mg, or placebo. Subjects in the etrasimod 2 mg group experienced a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, the mean difference from placebo at Week 12 in the adapted Mayo score (least squares mean [standard error] difference: −0.99 [0.42]; p = 0.0091) compared with placebo. The etrasimod 2 mg group also experienced significant improvement in all secondary endpoints compared with the placebo group at Week 12 including, improvement in the total Mayo Score (estimated least squares mean [standard error] difference from placebo: −1.27 [0.55]; p = 0.0100), and higher percentage of subjects with endoscopic improvement (41.8%, difference from placebo: 24.4%, p = 0.003). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the 1 mg, 2 mg, and placebo groups were reported for 59.6%, 56.0%, and 50.0% of subjects, respectively; treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 7.7%, 10.0%, and 5.6% of subjects, respectively; serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for 5.8%, 0%, and 11.1% of subjects, respectively; and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were reported for 5.8%, 8.0%, and 0% of subjects, respectively. No subjects died during the study. Overall, the 2 mg dose demonstrated a favorable safety profile and was chosen as the dose for the current Phase 3 program. widely used, and in accordance with the nonbinding US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry, Ulcerative Colitis: Clinical Trials Endpoints (FDA 2016). Other endpoints for the study are widely used and considered reliable measures of efficacy and safety. As detailed in Section 10.2, the study is powered to the primary endpoint for demonstrating a statistically significant difference in achieving clinical remission between etrasimod therapy and placebo at Week 12. The 2:1 randomization scheme will maximize the number of subjects receiving a potentially beneficial therapy. At the end of the 12-Week Induction Treatment Period, subjects will be eligible to enter the APD334-303 OLE study provided they meet all entry criteria. 3.3. Study Duration The study consists of a 28-day Screening Period, a 12-Week Induction Treatment Period, and a 4-Week Follow-Up Period. The study duration is expected to be approximately 1.5 years. The End of Study Date is the date when the last subject completes his/her last study visit. 3.4. Independent Data Monitoring Committee An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be utilized to monitor the safety of subjects and to enhance the integrity and credibility of the study. The roles and responsibilities of the DMC are described in detail in the DMC Charter. The DMC will abide by the principles set forth in the FDA Guidance for Industry, Clinical Trial Sponsors, Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees (FDA 2006). As part of its role, the DMC will conduct reviews of accumulating safety and efficacy data at specified intervals during the conduct of the trial, according to the guidelines detailed in the DMC Charter. DMC recommendations to the study team will be communicated in a blinded fashion (ie, treatment assignment for individual subjects will not be shared). To ensure the scientific integrity of the study, members of the DMC will not be directly involved in the ongoing management of the study. In addition to members of the DMC, an independent statistician responsible for interacting with the DMC will have access to unblinded study data. This statistician will not be directly involved in the conduct of the study. The study population consists of men, women and adolescents (hereafter referred to as men and women), 16 to 80 years of age, inclusive, with moderately to severely active UC. 4.1.

Inadequate response, loss of response, and intolerance are defined as: • Inadequate response: Signs and symptoms of persistently active disease despite a history of completing a dosing regimen • Loss of response: Recurrence of symptoms of active disease during treatment following prior clinical benefit (discontinuation despite clinical benefit does not qualify as having failed or being intolerant to UC biologic therapy) • Intolerance: Including, but not limited to infusion- or injection related reaction, demyelination, congestive heart failure, infection, or any other related adverse event that led to a reduction in dose or discontinuation of the medication Note: To be considered inadequate response, loss of response, and intolerance after treatment with a biologic or tofacitinib, the subject must have received a dosing regimen consistent with the local product labeling and/or institutional standard of care. Concomitant treatments: 8. Subjects are permitted to be receiving a therapeutic dose of the following drugs: • Oral 5-ASA compounds provided the dose has been stable for ≥ 2 weeks immediately prior to randomization • Oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone at a stable dose ≤ 20 mg/day, budesonide at a stable dose ≤ 9 mg/day, or equivalent steroid) provided the dose has been stable for the 4 weeks immediately prior to the screening endoscopy assessment • Immunosuppressive agents such as oral azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) must be discontinued ≥ 2 weeks prior to randomization • Probiotics (eg, Culturelle®, Saccharomyces boulardii) provided the dose has been stable for the 2 weeks immediately prior to randomization If oral 5-ASA or corticosteroids have been recently discontinued, they must have been stopped for at least 2 weeks prior to the endoscopy used for the baseline MMS. 9.

Subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely, regardless of the reason, should be instructed to return for an Early Termination (ET) visit within 7 days of the last administration of study treatment (Table 7) and before initiation of any new treatments to complete all of the ET assessments. If a subject discontinues due to pregnancy, they are not required to complete the endoscopy. If the ET visit is within 4 weeks of the last sigmoidoscopy and biopsy, these procedures do not need to be repeated. If the ET visit is ≥ 2 weeks after the last administration of study treatment, the 2-Week Follow-Up visit is not required; however, the 4-Week Follow-Up visit should be scheduled and completed. If the ET visit is ≥ 4 weeks of the last administration of study treatment, the 4-Week Follow-Up visit is not required unless the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is not within normal limits. 5.2. Discontinuation from the Study Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time for any of the following reasons: • Withdrawal by subject or parent/guardian • Deviation/noncompliance with the study protocol that in the judgement of the Investigator and/or Medical Monitor the subject should not continue study treatment • Study termination by Sponsor • Lost to follow-up • Death • Other A subject may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution. If a subject withdraws consent, no further evaluation should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. The Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to document the specific reason why consent was withdrawn. In the event that a subject fails to attend any follow-up visits, all reasonable efforts will be made to contact the subject to ensure that he/she is in satisfactory health. All contacts and contact attempts must be documented in the subject’s file. 5.3. Subjects Lost to Follow-Up Prior to Last Scheduled Visit A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. or hybrid visit: • The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and or should continue in the study. • Before a subject is deemed lost to follow-up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last know mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s file. Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. 5.4. Premature Termination of the Study The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: • The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to subjects • Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory • Upon request of health authorities The Sponsor will notify Investigators if the study is placed on hold or if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study or development program. Health authorities and IECs/IRBs will be informed about the termination of the study in accordance with applicable regulations. The Sponsor has the right to replace a study site at any time. Reasons for replacing a study site may include, but are not limited to: • Excessively slow recruitment • Poor protocol adherence • Inaccurate or incomplete data recording • Non-compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for GCP 6.1. Treatments Administered Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (etrasimod or placebo) in a 2:1 ratio. Study treatment is outlined in Table 1. Table 1: Study Treatment 6.2. Investigational Study Treatment The active pharmaceutical ingredient in etrasimod tablets is APD334 . APD334 is manufactured, packaged, tested, and released in compliance with cGMP. The drug product is a blue, round, biconvex, plain, immediate-release, film-coated tablet. Etrasimod tablets are supplied in the dosage strength (based on etrasimod free acid content) of 2 mg. The placebo tablet formulation is composed of excipients . Placebo tablets are identical in appearance to the active-drug tablets as described above. 6.3. Dosage and Administration One tablet is to be taken each day (with water, either with or without food). Tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day, preferably in the morning. On study visit days, subjects should wait and take their dose after blood draws for PK and after all pre-dose assessments and procedures have been completed. The time of PK sample collection and last dosing prior to the PK sample should be documented in the eCRF. 6.3.1. Instructions for Missed Dose(s) Subjects should be instructed that if they forget to take a dose, they can take the dose within another tablet on the same day, but to take the next dose at the regular time on the following day. Missed doses should be recorded in the subject’s electronic diary (eDiary), as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments, Table 7. Subjects should be instructed to contact the Investigator if they miss more than 2 consecutive doses. Subjects who do not take the study treatment for ≥ 2 consecutive days within the first week of treatment or for ≥ 7 consecutive days after the first week of treatment must contact the Investigator to discuss treatment re-initiation. The subject must take the next dose of study treatment at the study site, and the in-clinic cardiac monitoring as outlined in Section 9.4.2.1 should be performed. 6.3.2. Dose Interruptions If the Investigator deems it necessary to withhold study treatment, temporary withholding is permitted for up to 6 days without obtaining prior approval from the Medical Monitor. If study treatment interruption ≥ 7 days is required for a medical reason, the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor. The first-dose monitoring as outlined in Section 9.4.2.1 should be performed any time a subject misses study treatment as follows: • ≥ 2 consecutive days within the first week of treatment, or • ≥ 7 consecutive days after the first week of treatment 6.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Subjects will be centrally assigned to randomized study treatment using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Before the study is initiated, the log in information and directions for the IWRS will be provided to each study site. Subjects will be randomized to study treatment via stratified randomization. Randomization will be stratified by (a) naïve to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy at study entry (yes or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and (c) baseline disease activity (MMS: 4 to 6 or 7 to 9). Each subject will be dispensed blinded study treatment at study visits (Table 7). 6.5. Blinding This is a double-blind study with limited access to the randomization code. The study treatment and placebo tablets and bottles are identical in physical appearance. The treatment each subject receives will not be disclosed to the Investigator, study site staff, subject, Sponsor personnel involved with the conduct of the study (with the exception of the clinical supply staff and designated safety staff), or study vendors. The IWRS will hold treatment codes and bottle numbers for study treatment. Treatment assignments should remain blinded unless that knowledge is necessary to determine subject emergency medical care. In case of an emergency, the Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment is warranted to Investigator on how to obtain treatment assignment in the event of an emergency unblinding. The Investigator is requested to contact the Medical Monitor promptly in case of any treatment unblinding. If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and electronic case report form (eCRF), as applicable. For Suspected, Unexpected, Serious Adverse Reactions, the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance designee responsible for managing SAEs, will access the IWRS to obtain the subject’s treatment assignment for the purpose of regulatory reporting. If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded for any reason, they will be discontinued from the study. 6.6. Treatment Compliance It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that subjects are correctly instructed on how to take their study treatment and that each subject is compliant with their assigned regimen. The study treatment should be dispensed by the Investigator, or by a qualified individual under the Investigator’s supervision. An up-to-date treatment inventory/dispensing record must be maintained as described in Section 8.4. Subject compliance will be based on tablet count. Tablet counts < 80% or > 120% of the expected value between visits should be documented as a protocol deviation. If there is a discrepancy between the tablet count and the subject’s compliance per the eDiary, it should be discussed with the subject and noted in the source documents. 6.7. Concomitant Therapy All over-the-counter and prescribed concomitant medications, blood products, procedures, vitamins, and holistic products, administered during the Screening Period and during the study through the safety reporting period must be recorded in the eCRF, as appropriate. 6.7.1. Required Concomitant Therapy Not applicable 6.7.2. Allowed Concomitant Therapy Concomitant medication for medical conditions other than UC are permitted as clinically indicated subject to specific protocol requirements outlined in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2. 6.7.2.1. Permitted Medications for the Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis Oral 5-ASA, AZA, 6-MP, oral corticosteroids, or medicinal probiotics are allowed at the time of screening and as per the inclusion criteria (Section 4.1); however, these products should not be started during screening or during the treatment period in subjects who are not already receiving them. Immunosuppressive agents such as oral AZA or 6-MP must be discontinued ≥ 2 weeks prior to randomization. study. Oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone at a stable dose ≤ 20 mg/day, budesonide at a stable dose ≤ 9 mg/day, or equivalent steroid) is allowed to be continued during the 12-Week Induction Treatment Period provided the dose has been stable for the 4 weeks immediately prior to the screening endoscopy assessment. 6.7.3. Prohibited Concomitant Therapy The following concomitant medications are prohibited during the study: • Treatments for UC other than those listed in Section 6.7.2.1 (either approved or investigational) • All live vaccines, during study treatment and within 8 weeks after the last dose of study treatment • Moderate/strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 (Table 2, for additional information, refer to (Flockhart 2019)) Table 2: Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors and Inducers CYP, cytochrome P450 • Start, stop, or change in dosage of any anti-arrhythmic drugs (Class I to IV) within 1 week before or after treatment re-initiation following drug interruption as specified in Section 6.3.2 • Inhibitors of UGT1A7 • Chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) use (Note: Occasional use of NSAIDs and acetaminophen [eg, headache, arthritis, myalgias, or menstrual cramps] and aspirin up to 325 mg/day is permitted) • Marketed biologic therapies • Immunosuppressive agents (eg, AZA, 6-MP, tofacitinib) • Any per rectum therapy including enemas (eg, 5-ASA, corticosteroid), other than that required for endoscopy preparation • Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, methotrexate, or MMF • Cholestyramine or other drugs interfering with enterohepatic circulation, unless the treatment has been stable for > 6 months prior to screening • Any investigational drug other than the study treatment synthesis inhibitors • Treatment with lymphocyte-trafficking inhibitors (natalizumab, fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod) • Immunosuppressive agents that deplete lymphocytes (eg, alemtuzumab, anti-CD4, cladribine, rituximab, ocrelizumab, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, daclizumab) The following concomitant procedures are prohibited during the study: • Major elective surgery. • Immunoadsorption columns • Intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis • Blood donations during the study and for 14 days after the last dose of study treatment. • Sperm or oocyte donations during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. 7. SUBJECT RESTRICTIONS Prohibited concomitant therapy is described in Section 6.7.3. Additionally, subjects are restricted from the following: • Poppy seeds: Consumption of poppy seeds within 48 hours prior to drug screening may cause a positive drug screen. Subjects who report that they have consumed poppy seeds within 48 hours of the Screening Visit should not be screened. They may return 48 hours after the last poppy seed consumption for screening. Poppy seeds should not be eaten between screening and Week 0/Day 1. • St John’s wort: Subjects should be instructed to abstain from consuming herbal remedies containing St John’s wort during the study as these may interfere with the metabolism of etrasimod. 8.1. Packaging and Labeling Study treatment will be provided in 40 cc induction-sealed, high-density polyethylene bottles with child-resistant screw caps. Each bottle will be labeled as required per country requirement. 8.2. Study Treatment Storage and Handling Bottles should be stored 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). In the case where a subject attends a virtual visit (refer to Section 9.6) and requires additional study treatment to continue on the study, study treatment may be dispensed and delivered by an approved courier where permitted by local law and regulation. Alternatively, a future supply of study medications may be dispensed to the subject at an onsite visit to cover study medications to be dispensed at the next planned virtual visit. Advanced planning and communication will be needed to dispense future supply of study medications at an earlier onsite visit. Shipping guidelines and instruction will be provided separately. 8.3. Study Treatment Preparation Not applicable. 8.4. Study Treatment Accountability At each visit, previously dispensed study treatment tablets will be collected by the Investigator or qualified individual and compliance assessed. The Investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the study treatment. To ensure adequate records, all drug supplies will be accounted for and will be monitored by counting of unused medication from individual bottles returned by the subject at each visit. 8.5. Study Treatment Retention and Disposal All study treatment will be reconciled by the clinical monitor and then returned or destroyed according to applicable country regulations. On-site destruction following all local regulations and in accordance with applicable site standard operating procedures (SOPs) is permitted. Prior to any action being taken with study treatment, the Investigator will contact the Sponsor (or contract research organization [CRO]) for approval of such action. Final reconciliation will be performed at Study Completion. 9.1. General Instructions • Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. • Results of all protocol-required procedures will be recorded in the eCRF whenever applicable. • Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Medical Monitor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discontinue study treatment. • Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7), is essential and required for study conduct. • Study visits should be scheduled in the morning, whenever possible. • All laboratory assessments required by the protocol will be performed by a central laboratory unless otherwise stated. • For onsite and offsite study visits (refer to Section 9.6 and Table 7), subjects should take their study treatment after blood draws for PK and after all pre-dose assessments and procedures have been completed. The Investigator will maintain a screening log and enrollment log to record details of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 9.2. Subject Information 9.2.1. Informed Consent The Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, parent(s), or legal guardian and the subject’s assent (for a minor subject according to local regulations) when applicable, before any study-specific activity is performed (Section 11.3 for additional details). 9.3. Screening and Eligibility Subject eligibility will be assessed based on protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm potential subjects meet all eligibility criteria. Screening procedures must be completed within 28 days prior to receiving the first dose of study treatment (Table 7). The Screening Period may be extended for subjects who require additional diagnostic testing/consults to determine status of either latent TB or C. difficile infection. If the subject is planned to be randomized > 28 days from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF), the Medical Monitor should be consulted to see if repeated testing is needed. The 28-Day Screening Period may also be extended on a case-by-case basis to accommodate reasonable delays in specific screening assessments (eg, PFTs, OCT] due to testing availability. The are considered, the ability to repeat the laboratory assessment should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and the outcome of the conversation should be documented. 9.3.1. Tuberculosis Screening and Chest X-Ray All subjects will complete TB screening to determine eligibility (refer to Appendix 2). If an Investigator feels the test for latent TB is abnormal, a retest to confirm latent TB status should be discussed and approved by the Medical Monitor. 9.3.2. Rescreening Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria can be rescreened per Investigator discretion. Additional screening attempts beyond the first should be approved by the Medical Monitor prior to rescreening. Each subject must be reconsented prior to each screening attempt. Subjects with a Screening Visit or Week 0/Day 1 prerandomization 12-lead ECG showing a second- or third-degree AV block, periods of asystole > 3 seconds, PR interval > 200 ms, or QTcF ≥ 450 ms (men) or QTcF ≥ 470 ms (women) are not eligible for rescreening. If a subject requires prophylactic therapy for latent TB, they may be rescreened as outlined in Section 4.2. If a subject is positive for C. difficile at screening, the subject may be treated and retested ≥ 4 weeks after completing treatment. 9.3.3. Demography and Other Subject Characteristics Demographics including year of birth, sex at birth, Hispanic ethnicity and race as described by the subject will be collected at screening. 9.3.4. Social History At screening, a social history including the amount and duration of tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine usage will be collected. A standard urine drug screen will be performed. Subjects who test positive will be assessed for eligibility in study participation by the Investigator. 9.3.5. Prior and Ongoing Therapies Prior therapies related to the treatment of UC will be collected during screening. In addition, documentation should also include the prior treatment response as one of the following: inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to (Section 4.1, Inclusion Criterion 7, for details). All medications taken and procedures carried out within 30 days prior to the first study treatment administration and all ongoing medications will be recorded at screening. Updates for new medications prior to dosing at the Day 1 visit should be made as needed. In order to determine the subject’s eligibility to the study, a complete medical history of each subject will be collected and documented during screening. The history should include recent blood donations (≤ 30 days prior to the Screening Period), illnesses, and participation in other investigational drug studies. In addition, a detailed history of the subject’s UC, including date of diagnosis, disease severity, hospitalizations, and extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), will be collected. 9.3.7. Vital Signs At screening, vital signs (resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic BP, body temperature, and respiratory rate) will be measured while sitting. 9.3.8. Pulmonary Function Test Pulmonary function tests including FEV and FVC measurements will be performed. In addition, 1 diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) measurements will be performed where locally available (sites where DLCO is not available should consult the Sponsor or Sponsor’s delegate). 9.3.9. Ophthalmoscopy and Optical Coherence Tomography Ophthalmoscopy and OCT will be performed. A general ophthalmologist can do the examination; although, a retinal specialist would be preferred wherever possible. Subjects with a history of macular edema or retinopathy are not eligible for the study (Section 4.2). 9.3.10. Clinical Laboratory Assessments Screening samples for complete blood count (CBC) with differential, platelet count, lymphocyte counts, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, natural killer lymphocytes (TBNK), serum chemistry, virology, thyroid panel, coagulation, urinalysis, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), TB screen, and stool sample should be obtained and results must be available and reviewed prior to randomization. In the case of new clinical laboratory abnormalities detected prior to randomization, the eligibility of the subject should be reconsidered with the guidance of the Medical Monitor. 9.3.11. Proctosigmoidoscopy/Colonoscopy and Modified Mayo Score Derivation • Proctosigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy must be performed prior to randomization to treatment to allow central reader review (may take approximately 5 to 12 days) and confirmation of eligibility. Preferably, proctosigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy should be performed after other criteria for inclusion (eg, laboratory criteria) have been met. • Determination of MMS score to qualify for randomization: − The MMS will be evaluated at Day 1. The subscores for SF and RB are derived from the subject eDiary entries using the scores from the 3 most recent consecutive days within the 7 days prior to the day of bowel preparation (excluding the day of bowel preparation), averaged and rounded to the nearest minimum of 7 days of eDiary data prior to bowel preparation are not eligible for randomization. The MMS must be 4 to 9, including an ES ≥ 2 and RB score ≥ 1, for the subject to be eligible for randomization. − For the normal SF, it is essential for the subject to be asked to identify how many stools he or she has in a 24-hour period when in remission from UC. Subjects should be instructed that a stool is defined as a trip to the toilet when the subject has either a bowel movement, or passes blood alone, blood and mucus, or mucus only. If the subject does not report that he or she has achieved remission, then the subject should be asked to identify the number of stools he or she had before initial onset of signs and symptoms of UC. 9.4. Randomization/Treatment Period 9.4.1. Week 0/Day 1: Prerandomization At the Week 0/Day 1 visit (Table 7), prior to randomization, a 12-lead ECG in the supine position and resting vital signs in the sitting position (heart rate, systolic and diastolic BP, body temperature, and respiratory rate) will be collected. Caffeine and/or nicotine are not permitted within 30 minutes prior to BP measurements. Subjects with the following must not be randomized and should be considered screen failures: • Sitting vital sign assessment: heart rate < 50 bpm OR systolic BP < 90 mm Hg OR diastolic BP < 55 mm Hg • 12-lead ECG showing a second or third-degree AV block, periods of asystole > 3 seconds, PR interval > 200 ms, or QTcF ≥ 450 ms (men) or QTcF ≥ 470 ms (women). All pre-dose 12-lead ECGs should be obtained prior to blood sample collection. Subjects who continue to meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized as outlined in Section 6.4. 9.4.2. Treatment Period After randomization, the 12-Week Treatment Period of the study will begin (Table 7). A study visit window of ± 3 days is permitted at each visit beginning with Week 2/Day 15 (PFT and OCT assessments have a window of ± 7 days). Study visits should be scheduled for the morning. The subscores for SF and RB are derived from the subject eDiary. On visits when MMS is calculated, these subscores are derived using the scores from the 3 most recent consecutive days within the 7 days prior to the day of bowel preparation (excluding the day of bowel preparation), averaged and rounded to the nearest integer. If 3 consecutive days are not available, then the average of the 2 most recent consecutive days within the 7 days will be used. On visits without endoscopy, the SF and RB subscores are derived using the scores from the 3 most recent consecutive days within the 7 days prior to the date of visit, averaged and rounded to the nearest integer. If 3 consecutive days are not available, then the average of the 2 most same time of day for each visit. Below is the recommended sequence of events: • Questionnaire administration • Adverse event review • Vital signs • 12-lead ECG (as indicated) • Physical examination • EIMs (as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments, Table 7) • PFT (as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments, Table 7) • OCT (as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments, Table 7) • Blood sample collection for laboratory tests and pre-dose PK sampling 9.4.2.1. Guidance for Cardiac Monitoring Following Treatment Initiation or Re-Initiation Prerandomization (ie, pre-dose/baseline) vital signs (resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic BP, body temperature, and respiratory rate) will be used as the Baseline measurement. The pre-dose heart rate measurement will be used for comparison to the post-dose measurement. Subjects should receive the first dose of study treatment before 12:00 PM (noon). First Dose Cardiac Monitoring In-clinic cardiac monitoring, of at least 4 hours, will occur on Day 1 and will include the following (Table 3): • Full baseline vital signs (heart rate, systolic and diastolic BP, body temperature, and respiratory rate) and a 12-lead ECG (taken with the subject in the supine position) will be assessed prerandomization. • After the first dose of study treatment on Day 1, subjects must remain under observation in the clinic for at least 4 hours. • At Hours 1, 2, and 3 (± 15 minutes) post-dose, the heart rate and systolic and diastolic BP will be assessed with the subject in the sitting position, with the time recorded. If the subject has a heart rate < 50 bpm or if cardiovascular symptoms develop, then the subject should remain closely monitored, including 12-lead ECGs as clinically indicated, until the Hour 4 discharge assessment. • At the Hour 4 (± 15 minutes) discharge assessment, heart rate and systolic and diastolic BP will be assessed with the subject in the sitting position and a 12-lead ECG (with the subject in the supine position) will be performed. Subjects may be discharged from the clinic after the 4-hour assessment if they meet the criteria described in Table 4. Subjects not meeting the discharge criteria will require extended monitoring as described below. chest pain, dizziness, palpitations, or syncope) associated with reduction of the heart rate or clinically relevant 12-lead ECG changes at any time during the 4-hour monitoring period must be discontinued from treatment (Table 5). Table 3: Procedures to be Performed During the Monitoring Period a Measurements may be taken ± 15 minutes of the scheduled time. b Heart rate is based on vital signs. Table 4: Discharge Criteria After Cardiac Monitoring AV, atrioventricular. Note: Subjects should have written instructions on when to return to the clinic and a 24-hour contact phone number to call in the event of any new or worsened cardiovascular symptoms. Extended Cardiac Monitoring Subjects who do not meet discharge criteria at 4-hours post-dose will require extended cardiac monitoring: • Vital signs will be assessed hourly and 12-lead ECG may be performed, as clinically indicated, until the subject meets the discharge criteria (Table 4). • The Medical Monitor should be contacted if the subject does not meet the discharge criteria after ≥ 4 hours of extended cardiac monitoring. • Any subject who requires extended monitoring on Day 1 must return on Day 2 for the second dose and will be re-monitored as on Day 1. These subjects will be discontinued from study treatment if they do not meet the discharge criteria at 4 hours after the second dose. Extended cardiac monitoring should be continued until the subject meets the discharge criteria (Table 4). • Subjects experiencing a symptomatic event (eg, chest pain, dizziness, palpitations, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or syncope) at any time during the 4-hour monitoring period that is not associated with either a reduction in heart rate or clinically relevant change in 12-lead ECG, may be discharged provided they meet the discharge criteria (Table 4), and as deemed appropriate by the Investigator; however, discharge criteria at 4 hours after the second dose on Day 2 and extended cardiac monitoring should be continued until the subject meets the discharge criteria (Table 4). 9.4.3. Study Treatment Discontinuation Related to Post-dose Cardiac Monitoring A complete list of reasons for study treatment discontinuation is provided in Section 5. Reasons for study treatment discontinuation specific to post-dose cardiac monitoring are provided in Table 5. The Medical Monitor should be contacted before discontinuing a subject. Table 5: Discontinuation of Study Treatment-Related to Post-Dose Cardiac Monitoring a All treatment discontinuations should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. Cardiac Monitoring Upon Treatment Re-Initiation Following Dose Interruption Subjects should undergo the same first dose cardiac monitoring procedures as the original treatment initiation when study treatment dosing is interrupted for: • ≥ 2 consecutive days within the first week of treatment • ≥ 7 consecutive days after the first week of treatment 9.5. Follow-Up Period For subjects not participating in the OLE study, a follow-up visit will be performed at 2 and 4 weeks after the last administration of study treatment as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7). If the ET or Study Completion visit is ≥ 2 weeks after the last administration of study treatment, the 2-Week Follow-Up visit is not required; however, the 4-Week Follow-Up visit should be scheduled and completed. If the ET or Study Completion visit is ≥ 4 weeks after the last administration of study treatment, the 4-Week Follow-Up visit is not required. If the absolute peripheral lymphocyte count is not within normal limits at the 4-Week Follow-Up visit, subjects should return for CBC with differential according to local standard of care (captured as subsequent Follow-Up visit or unscheduled visit). All adverse events should be recorded for 30 days after last administration of study treatment (Section 9.10.8.2.2). Study visits after Day 1 may be conducted via onsite (in person at the study site or specialty lab), offsite (home health visit by study staff or designee), virtual (eg, telephone, video conference), or hybrid (a combination of aforementioned visit types) depending on the nature of the study assessment, technological capability, and acceptability with institutional practices and in alignment with local law and regulatory requirements. These may take place on different days within the study visit window. Certain assessments and/or procedures will not be performed in the home setting (eg, endoscopies, OCT, PFT, cardiac monitoring following treatment initiation or re-initiation, and 12-lead ECG). Pregnancy testing and central laboratory assessments (eg, blood, stool, and urine samples) can be performed by either onsite visit or offsite visit. Assessments or procedures that may be conducted virtually, if allowed by local law and regulation, include for example: medical and medication history to assess eligibility criteria, review of demographic information, social history, AE query, review of concomitant medications, eDiary training, and compliance review/monitoring including study drug administration. During a virtual assessment, a subject may report an AE that requires a follow-up symptom- focused physical exam or diagnostic test, as determined by the Investigator. In this scenario, the Investigator may have the subject return to the study site for an unscheduled study visit to perform the assessment. For study drug accountability, the medication bottle and remaining tablets may be visually inspected and counted on video conferencing. Subjects must return the dispensed bottle with the remaining tablets along with any empty bottles to the study site at the next onsite visit. Refer to Section 8 for study treatment management. Regardless of how a study visit and its associated procedures are conducted, all study procedures should be performed by qualified study site staff or qualified individual as delegated by the Principal Investigator. Study visits are designated accordingly in the Schedules of Assessments (Table 7). 9.7. Pharmacokinetics Blood samples for analysis of etrasimod, and if warranted M3 (AR503641) and other metabolite(s) of interest, will be collected at the following time points from all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (etrasimod or placebo): • Pre-dose and at 4 hours (± 15 minutes) post-dose (after 12-lead ECG) on Week 0/Day 1 • Pre-dose (trough; within 60 minutes prior to dosing) at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 • At 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up visits • If possible, at the time of any SAE or adverse event leading to study treatment the time must be recorded in the eCRF. The time of administration of study treatment during the study visit must also be recorded in the source along with the time of each PK sample. Blood samples will be processed for collection of plasma fractions for determination of the concentrations of etrasimod, and if warranted M3 (AR503641) and other metabolite(s) of interest. For the placebo group, a selected number of samples will be analyzed. Plasma PK samples may also be used for profiling of drug-binding proteins, bioanalytical method validation purposes, stability assessments, metabolite assessments, or to assess other actions of etrasimod with plasma constituents. No urine samples will be collected for PK analysis. Sample collection, preparation, and shipping will be detailed in a Laboratory Manual. 9.8. Efficacy Assessments The components of the MMS are used to calculate several of the primary, secondary, endpoints. The definitions for MMS components are outlined in Section 10.5. 9.8.1. Modified Mayo Score/Mayo Clinic Score This study utilizes the MMS, which includes the ES, RB, and SF components of the Mayo Clinic score (MCS; Appendix 3), to assess UC disease activity in support of the primary and secondary endpoints. The total score range of the MMS is from 0 to 9, with each component ranging from 0 to 3 (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The MMS requires daily subject-reported RB and SF scores; therefore, the importance of daily recording of RB and SF by subjects in their daily eDiary should be stressed by the Investigators. Endoscopy will be used to visualize the mucosa to enable calculation of the ES. Endoscopic score (ES): The ES reports the worst appearance of the mucosa on flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, on a 4-point scale (Appendix 3). Consistent with regulatory advice, this study excludes friability from the definition of an ES of 1. The ES will be determined by a blinded central reader. Rectal bleeding (RB): The RB subscore is a subject-reported measure. This item reports the most severe amount of blood passed per rectum in a 24-hour period, on a 4-point scale (Appendix 3). The subject will record this in their daily eDiary. The method for calculating the RB subscore is described in Section 9.4.2. Stool frequency (SF): The SF subscore is a subject-reported measure. This item reports the number of stools in a 24-hour period, relative to the normal number of stools for that subject in the same period, on a 4-point scale (Appendix 3). A stool is defined as a trip to the toilet when the subject has either a bowel movement, passage of blood alone, passage of blood and mucus, or passage of mucus only. The total number of stools passed in a 24-hour period will be recorded by the subject in a daily eDiary. The reference “normal” SF for that subject will be recorded electronically at the Screening Visit and is the number of stools in a 24-hour period when the subject is in remission. If the subject has never achieved remission, the reported SF before initial the SF subscore is described in Section 9.4.2. Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA): The PGA is a physician-reported measure that is a component of the MCS and is used in the calculation of the total Mayo Score. The PGA summarizes the Investigator’s assessment of the subject’s UC disease activity on a 4-point scale (Appendix 3). The Investigator will record the PGA in the site tablet at the specified study visits (Table 7). Consistent with regulatory guidance, the PGA will not be used for primary or secondary efficacy assessment in this study. 9.8.1.1. Endoscopy A flexible proctosigmoidoscopy, performed with a video endoscope following cleansing preparation (oral or rectal cathartic), will be performed during screening (prior to Day 1/randomization) and at Week 12/ET visit. To ensure quality data and standardization, the same endoscopist should be used throughout the study wherever possible. Endoscopy images will be obtained during each endoscopy and will be sent for central reading and determination of the Mayo endoscopic score. A detailed image review charter from the central reading laboratory will outline the endoscopic procedures, video recordings, and equipment. For each subject, a video recording of the entire endoscopic procedure will be performed using an acceptable storage medium. The endoscopic recordings will be read centrally in a blinded manner for mucosal lesions and endoscopic severity by a qualified gastroenterologist according to the image review charter. The ES will be evaluated by the Investigator and the central reader. The central read will be used for determination of efficacy endpoints; however, treatment decisions will be made by the treating Investigator. Repeat flexible proctosigmoidoscopy may be permitted by the Sponsor when the central reader indicates that the video endoscope data were acquired incorrectly or did not meet the minimal required quality standards. Note: For subjects with pancolitis > 8 years duration or subjects with left-sided colitis > 12 years without a surveillance colonoscopy within 12 months prior to baseline (Section 4.1, Inclusion Criterion 6), a colonoscopy and biopsies taken in accordance with local standard of care at screening to rule out dysplasia (ie, in place of screening proctosigmoidoscopy) is required. Any adenomatous polyps must be removed prior to their first administration of study treatment. 9.8.1.2. Endoscopic Biopsies Per inclusion criteria (Section 4.1), a histopathology report supporting the diagnosis of UC must be available in the source documents prior to randomization. Post-randomization detected polyps or suspicious findings during endoscopy will be managed as per local standard of care. If a histopathology report is not available, the screening endoscopy may serve as such with histology evaluated at the local histology laboratory. Biopsies will be obtained at each endoscopy to support assessment of the histopathology endpoints . Up to 4 biopsy pairs (ie, total 8) will be collected from the most affected area 15 to 25 cm from the anal verge. For subjects with proctitis only at baseline, biopsies should be taken 8 to 10 cm from the anal clearly indicated. Detailed instructions for endoscopic biopsies (eg, number of biopsies, anatomic site, normal or inflamed mucosa) will be provided. Biopsy samples will be processed by a central laboratory and histopathologic scoring using the Geboes, Robarts, and Nancy histopathology indices (Appendix 4) will be performed by a blinded central histopathology reader (Geboes 2000, Marchal-Bressenot 2017, Mosli 2017). Biopsy specimen transfer, processing, slide preparation and digitization of slides for histopathologic scoring procedures will be detailed in a histopathology manual. Histopathology results will not be made available to study sites. 9.8.2. Extraintestinal Manifestations During the specified full physical examinations (Table 7) specific systems (such as eyes, liver, skin, and joints) will be examined for EIMs for UC. 9.8.3. Additional Health-Related Subject-Reported Outcomes Subject-reported quality of life instruments will be completed electronically and checked for completeness at the study site as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7) and will be used in support of the efficacy outcomes. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ): The IBDQ is a validated 32-item questionnaire used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in subjects with IBD (UC and CD). Response to each of the questions is graded from 1 to 7 with overall score ranging from 32 (very poor HRQoL) to 224 (perfect HRQoL). Ulcerative Colitis Patient-Reported Outcomes Signs and Symptoms (UC-PRO/SS): The UC-PRO/SS is used to gather data on the gastrointestinal signs and symptoms of UC directly from the subject. The UC-PRO/SS is a 9-item questionnaire containing 2 domains: bowel movement signs and symptoms (6 items) and abdominal symptoms (3 items). An average score is calculated for each domain; a higher score indicates worse symptoms. The UC-PRO/SS will be administered if and when available. Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Version 2 Physical and Mental Component and Domain Scores: The SF-36 is a 36-item, subject-reported survey of subject health. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions measuring 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, general health perceptions, mental health, social function, and vitality. The subject’s responses are solicited using Likert scales that vary in length, with 3 to 6 response options per item. The SF-36 will be scored using 2 overall summary scores: physical component summary and mental component summary scores. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire – Ulcerative Colitis (WPAI-UC): The WPAI-UC consists of 6 questions asking about the effect of UC on the subject’s ability to work and perform regular activities. Urgency Numeric Rating Scale (NRS): The urgency NRS is a single item that measures the severity for the urgency (sudden or immediate need) to have a bowel movement in the past abdominal pain in the past 24 hours” using an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as can imagine). 9.8.4. Efficacy-Related Biomarkers Samples for biomarker assessments will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7). Blood, tissue, and stool samples will be analyzed by the central or specialty laboratory. Details for collection, processing, and storage will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. Residual samples will be stored and may be used for additional analyses if the subject has granted consent where allowed by the regulatory authorities and local ethics committees. C-reactive protein (CRP): CRP is an acute phase protein expressed by hepatocytes in response to inflammatory cytokines and will be assessed using a hs-CRP assay. Investigators will be blinded to the hs-CRP results during the treatment and follow-up periods. Fecal calprotectin: Fecal calprotectin is a complex consisting of calcium-binding proteins. It is expressed by activated neutrophils (and to a lesser extent by macrophages and monocytes) and fecal levels correlate with the number of neutrophils in the gut. It is used as a biomarker of intestinal inflammation. Investigators will be blinded to the fecal calprotectin results during the treatment and follow-up periods. Lymphocyte counts: Etrasimod is believed to modulate lymphocyte trafficking resulting in a reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count and lymphocyte availability for recruitment to sites of inflammation. During the treatment period, the Investigator will be blinded to the white blood cell (WBC) and differential counts during the treatment and follow-up periods. During the treatment period, WBC differential results will be assessed by an unblinded Medical Monitor (not providing direct medical oversight of study conduct). If either of the following occur, the unblinded Medical Monitor will notify the Investigator with additional instructions. • ANC < 1000 cells/μL • ALC < 200 cells/μL If the ANC is confirmed below the 1000 cells/µL limit, the Investigator will be requested to closely monitor for serious infection and institute appropriate follow-up at his or her discretion. If the ALC is confirmed below the 200 cells/µL limit, study treatment should be interrupted and should not be reinitiated if the ALC remains below this threshold. In this situation, the unblinded Medical Monitor will notify the Investigator and provide instructions on additional actions that the Investigator may need to take. When there is at least one measurement of ALC < 200 cells/µL, blinded values may be released to treating physicians and Investigators as deemed medically necessary to monitor infection and/or aid in diagnostic work-up as clinically indicated, and/or as a tool to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions for an infection. Investigators will repeat CBC with differentials weekly until ALC > 500 cells/µL. Re-initiation of the study treatment can only be considered when ALC > 500 cells/µL. 9.9. Genetics Genetics will be evaluated in this study to assess genetic variation that may impact response to treatment, metabolism, and mechanism of action of etrasimod. DNA may be used for immunophenotyping by epigenetic profiling. A blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from subjects who have consented to participate in the genetic analysis component of the study. Participation is optional. Subjects who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study. In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement genetic blood sample may be requested from the subject. Details on the processes for collection and shipment and destruction of these samples can be found in the Laboratory Manual. 9.10. Safety The Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an adverse event or SAE (Section 9.10.8.1). Adverse events will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Full and symptom-directed physical examinations will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7). Full physical examination includes the following assessments: • General inspection • Weight/height (height at screening only) • Skin • Head/ears/eyes/nose/throat examination • Neck • Cardiac examination • Auscultation of lungs • Abdominal examination (liver, spleen, and lower abdomen) • Neurological assessment • Musculoskeletal assessment to include lower extremity edema evaluation Symptom-directed (focused) physical examinations should assess clinically significant changes from full physical examinations or any new signs or symptoms. 9.10.2. Vital Signs Resting vital signs measurements will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7) with the subject in the sitting position. Vital signs will be measured prior to any blood draws that occur at the same study visit. Blood pressure may be measured manually or by automated device. Proper technique should be utilized during the measurement of BP to include the following: • The subject’s arm should be bare and supported at heart level. • An appropriately sized cuff (cuff bladder encircling at least 80% of the arm) should be utilized. Subject’s legs should not be crossed during the evaluation. 9.10.3. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram All 12-lead ECGs will be performed according to Section 9.4.2.1 and the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7), and if clinically indicated at any time during the treatment period per Investigator discretion. All ECGs will be recorded from a 12-lead ECG machine with the subject in the supine position. Every attempt should be made to ensure the subject 12-lead ECG readings are obtained using the same machine throughout the study. Intervals to be provided on the confirmed read for each safety 12-lead ECG are: RR, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF. If an ECG shows a new onset QTc interval > 500 ms during the treatment period, a repeat ECG is warranted. If this abnormal finding is confirmed, study treatment must be interrupted. Effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be employed. should be corrected as clinically indicated. When evaluating a subject with new onset QTc interval above 500 ms, referral to a cardiologist experienced in treating cardiac conduction disorders should be considered. Re-initiation of study treatment can only be considered after all of the following have occurred: • The QTcF interval is < 450 ms (men) or < 470 ms (women) • The QTc prolongation is considered by the Investigator and confirmed by the cardiologist as not related to study treatment and likely caused by other factors • Individual risk-benefit is favorable (as determined by the Investigator, in agreement with the cardiologist), AND • After discussion with the Medical Monitor. The Investigator will be responsible for review and interpretation of 12-lead ECGs on site and determining if the 12-lead ECG is normal, abnormal clinically insignificant, or abnormal clinically significant. Findings will be documented in the eCRF. All 12-lead ECGs performed should be available for collection upon request. 9.10.4. Pulmonary Function Test Pulmonary function tests will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7) and includes FEV and FVC measurements. All subjects will have PFTs performed at Screening, 1 and Week 12, or at the ET visit. PFTs occurring at the ET visit that are within 4 weeks of the last assessment will only be required if clinically indicated. The 2-Week Follow-Up visit assessment is only required if clinically indicated. Subjects reporting respiratory adverse events such as dyspnea during the treatment period may return at an unscheduled visit for assessment per Investigator discretion; additional PFTs may be performed as clinically indicated. Subjects experiencing a decline in PFT values (FEV and/or FVC) below 50% of the predicted 1 values must be discontinued from study treatment and scheduled for a follow-up visit. When available, DLCO measurements will also be performed. When DLCO is not available, sites should consult the Sponsor or Sponsor’s delegate). These tests will be performed at a qualified pulmonary function laboratory or respiratory department. Please refer to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines for standardization of spirometry and single breath determination of carbon monoxide uptake in the lung (MacIntyre 2005, Miller 2005a, Miller 2005b). The safety of trial subjects and site staff is paramount, so it is at the Investigator’s discretion whether PFT can be safely administered to trial subjects during the treatment period. The Investigator should evaluate on a case-by-case basis how best to proceed based on the subject’s medical history, the Investigator’s clinical judgement, and in consultation with the Medical Monitor. All reasonable efforts should be made to ensure safety and adherence to the protocol. When available, spirometry may be conducted at the clinical site instead of at the pulmonary laboratory. If the decision is made that it is not appropriate to conduct PFTs due to the safety lifting of local restrictions, re-opening of local PFT labs, or improved safety conditions) the tests should be conducted as soon as possible and as close to the timepoints as outlined in the protocol. 9.10.5. Ophthalmoscopy and Optical Coherence Tomography A complete ophthalmoscopy and OCT will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7). OCTs occurring at the ET visit that are within 4 weeks of the last assessment will only be required if clinically indicated. The 2-Week Follow-Up visit assessment is only required if clinically indicated. A standard visual acuity chart should be used for the visual acuity assessment. The OCT machine used should preferably not be changed during the study to allow for comparison of central foveal thickness measurements within each subject across time points. Screening Visit: At the screening ophthalmology visit, the eye examination will include: • Ophthalmologic history • Best corrected visual acuity measurement (using Snellen chart internationally [if available]) • Ophthalmoscopy (may include contact lens biomicroscopy to examine the macula and optic disc). A dilated fundus exam should be performed in all subjects at the Screening Visit and as needed at subsequent visits in subjects with significant abnormalities identified on the screening exam. • Measurement of central foveal thickness by OCT (recorded in micrometers; required for all subjects regardless of the results of visual acuity or ophthalmoscopy) • Slit lamp examination should be performed to establish uveitis disease status (yes/no). Uveitis should be characterized and graded using the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature criteria. Subjects with active uveitis without macular edema at Screening are eligible to enroll in the study • If there is a suspicion of macular edema by ophthalmoscopy and increased central foveal thickness by OCT, then additional testing should be considered at the discretion of the ophthalmologist (for example, fluorescein angiogram may be performed). Subjects with diagnosed macular edema at Screening should be deemed a screening failure and should not be randomized. • Optional procedures in case of clinically significant abnormalities on ophthalmic exam may include but are not limited to: − Retinal photographs − Intraocular pressure At the scheduled ophthalmology visit, the eye examination will include • Best corrected visual acuity measurement • Ophthalmoscopy (may include contact lens biomicroscopy to examine the macula and optic disc) • Measurement of central foveal thickness by OCT • For subjects with uveitis findings on ophthalmic exam, additional testing should be considered (for example, fluorescein angiogram). Subjects experiencing unexpected ophthalmic symptoms without a known suspected etiology or experiencing a relevant ophthalmic AE may need to have repeated ophthalmoscopy and OCT testing performed. 9.10.6. Tuberculosis Screening and Chest X-Ray All subjects will complete TB screening to determine eligibility. A TB screening questionnaire will be completed during the Screening Period by the PI or delegated site staff for each subject and applicable information will be entered into the eCRF. For subjects residing in countries with a high burden of TB or multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB as identified by WHO, the TB screening questionnaire will be completed at every study visit (Appendix 2). For subjects who are receiving TB prophylaxis treatment, the TB questionnaire will be completed at every study visit (until TB prophylaxis treatment course is completed). 9.10.7. Clinical Laboratory Tests Refer to Table 6 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7) for timing and frequency for each test. Details regarding clinical laboratory sample collection, preparation, and shipment are provided in the Laboratory Manual by the central laboratory. Clinical safety laboratory tests should be completed pre-dose. The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the adverse event section of the eCRF (results of the total WBC and ALC will be reviewed and monitored as described in Section 9.8.4). The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those that are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the Investigator or Medical Monitor. • If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the Investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the Sponsor should be notified. Assessments (Table 7), must be conducted in accordance with the Laboratory Manual. • If laboratory values from non-protocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in subject management or are considered clinically significant by the Investigator (eg, adverse event, SAE, or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the eCRF. For guidance on monitoring subjects with notable lymphopenia, please refer to Section 9.8.4. SCREENING Only Virology HIV, HBsAg, HCV (RIBA) Stool Sample Bacterial culture, ova and parasites, C. difficile Drugs of Abuse Amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, opiate, oxycodone, phencyclidine Others Hemoglobin A1C, QuantiFERON BIOMARKERS Lymphocytesa,b hs-CRPb Fecal calprotectinb Immunophenotyping Proteomics RNA Transcriptomics Fecal microbiome a Total WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and TBNK will be available for review prior to randomization. After randomization, the total WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and TBNK cell counts will be reviewed by an unblinded Medical Monitor who will provide instructions to the site Investigator in the event of significant lymphopenia. Investigators will remain blinded to the results after randomization. Refer to Section 9.8.4 for additional details. b Investigators will remain blinded to the results after randomization. c Stool sample for bacterial culture, ova, and parasite evaluation, and C. difficile assay at any point in the study when a subject becomes symptomatic, including worsening or return of disease activity. β-hCG, human beta-human chorionic gonadotropin; HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antigen; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; hs-CRP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; IgG, immunoglobulin G; RIBA, recombinant immunoblot assay; TBNK, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and natural killer lymphocytes; WBC, white blood cells 9.10.7.1. Screening 9.10.7.1.1. Drugs of Abuse A standard urine drug screen will be performed (Table 6). Subjects who test positive will be assessed for eligibility for study participation by the Investigator. 9.10.7.1.2. Pregnancy Testing A serum pregnancy test for β-hCG will be performed on women of childbearing potential to determine eligibility. Post-screening urine pregnancy tests (β-hCG) should be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7). If at any point there is a case of a positive urine β-hCG test, the subject will have study treatment interrupted and a serum sample submitted to the central laboratory for β-hCG testing. If the serum test confirms positive, the subject will be withdrawn from the study treatment and all the necessary follow-up assessments will be conducted as per Section 9.10.9. If the serum test is negative, the subject may resume study treatment. Negative pregnancy test results must be documented for all women of childbearing potential prior to dosing at applicable study visits. Women who are surgically sterile or who are postmenopausal are not considered to be of childbearing potential. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. Screening HIV antibody, hepatitis B (ie, HBsAg), and HCV (recombinant immunoblot assay, if positive HCV RNA should be used to confirm infection). 9.10.7.1.4. Clinical Chemistry, Hematology, Coagulation, and Urinalysis Clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis parameters that will be assessed during the study are identified in Table 6. Subjects will be in a seated or supine position during blood collection. All laboratory samples should be collected prior to the administration of study treatment at applicable visits (Refer to Section 9.6 for timing of blood draws for PK). 9.10.8. Adverse Events 9.10.8.1. Definitions 9.10.8.1.1. Adverse Event An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Adverse events can be any of the following: • Unfavorable changes in general condition • Subjective or objective signs/symptoms • Concomitant disease or accidents • Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters over the course of the study • Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity, increase in frequency, or have new signs/symptoms 9.10.8.1.2. Serious Adverse Event An adverse event should be classified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria: Fatal: Adverse event resulted in death. Life-threatening: The adverse event placed the subject at immediate risk of death. This classification does not apply to an adverse event that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe. Hospitalization: The adverse event required or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization. Hospitalizations for elective medical or surgical procedures or treatments planned before the signing of informed definition. Disabling/ The adverse event resulted in a persistent or significant incapacity or incapacitating: substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions. Congenital anomaly An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject exposed to the or birth defect: molecule or study treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy. Medically significant: The adverse event did not meet any of the above criteria but could have jeopardized the subject and might have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. 9.10.8.1.3. Adverse Drug Reaction An adverse drug reaction (ADR) in the pre-approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, is any noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product related to any dose. The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility (ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out). 9.10.8.1.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest Based on the mechanism of action of etrasimod and prior experience with other agents acting via a similar mechanism, potential adverse events of special interest may be identified. In addition to appropriate reporting of these events as an adverse event or SAE, supplementary detailed information may be collected. If there are any signs of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)-related symptoms, the Investigator should withhold study treatment and perform appropriate diagnostic evaluation per local standard of care at the first signs suggestive of PML. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and may include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The Investigator must notify the Medical Monitor of such an event. Guidance for the Assessment of Potential Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy is provided in Appendix 5. 9.10.8.1.5. Severity The severity of each adverse event will be assessed at the onset by a nurse/or physician. When recording the outcome of the adverse event the maximum severity of the adverse event experienced will also be recorded. The severity of each adverse event will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0): observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling, limiting self-care ADL (eg, preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money) Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5: Death related to adverse event 9.10.8.1.6. Relationship The Investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the causal relationship of the AE to the study drug using a 4-category system according to the following guidelines: Not Related: The AE is definitely caused by the subject’s clinical state or the study procedure/conditions. Unlikely Related: The temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE. Probably Related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug and cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. Related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known or hypothesized cause-effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the drug is reintroduced. The Investigator will use clinical judgement to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment administration should be considered and investigated. The Investigator should consult the IB and the Product Information of marketed products within the drug class, when applicable. For each adverse event/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor; however, it is very important that the Investigator always make an initial assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE to the Sponsor. The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality based on subsequent receipt of information and send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the 9.10.8.2.1. Eliciting Adverse Events Subjects will be instructed that they may report adverse events at any time. An open-ended or nondirected method of questioning should be used at each study visit to elicit the reporting of adverse events. 9.10.8.2.2. Recording Adverse Events The adverse event reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject is initially included in the study (date of first signature of informed consent) and continues up to 30 days after the last administration of study treatment. If an adverse event is not resolved or stabilized by this time, the Sponsor in consultation with the Investigator will decide whether to continue to monitor the adverse event or closeout the event in the database if no further follow-up is necessary. Any SAE suspected to be related to the study treatment must be reported whenever it occurs, irrespective of the time elapsed since the last administration of study treatment. Investigators and study personnel will record all adverse events and SAEs whether received through an unsolicited report by a subject, elicited during subject questioning, discovered during physical examination, laboratory testing, and/or other means by recording them on the eCRF and/or SAE Form, as appropriate. The following information should be recorded on the adverse event eCRF: • Description including onset and resolution dates • Whether it met SAE criteria • Severity • Relationship to study treatment or other causality • Outcome For SAEs, events occurring secondary to the primary event should be described on the eCRF in the narrative description field. The following should be considered when recording SAEs: • Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be recorded and reported on the eCRF. • For hospitalizations, surgical, or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure itself. The procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken in response to the illness. 9.10.8.2.3. Diagnosis Versus Signs or Symptoms In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual symptoms. Grouping of symptoms into a diagnosis should only be done if each component sign and/or report the individual symptom as a separate adverse event. 9.10.8.3. Reporting Adverse Events All SAEs are subject to reporting requirements. 9.10.8.3.1. Serious Adverse Events Any adverse event considered serious by the Investigator or Sub-Investigator or that meets serious criteria should be reported to the designated safety contact within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event (or in India within 24 hours of event occurrence). Enter the SAE information into eCRF, and send other available pertinent information (eg, hospital records, laboratory results, etc) to the designated Sponsor Contact. IQVIA Pharmacovigilance If additional information is required or becomes available for a previously reported SAE, entry of the new information into eCRF should be completed within 24 hours of awareness. Elective hospitalization and/or surgery for clearly preexisting conditions (eg, a surgery that has been scheduled prior to the subject’s entry into the study) will not be reported as an SAE. Any SAE that is ongoing when the subject completes the study or discontinues the study will be followed by the Investigator until the event resolved, stabilized or returned to baseline status. 9.10.8.3.2. Serious, Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions All ADRs that are both serious and unexpected are subject to expedited reporting to regulatory agencies. An unexpected ADR is one for which the nature or severity is not consistent with information in the relevant source documents. Since etrasimod is an investigational medicinal product that has not yet been approved for marketing in any country, the IB in effect during the study will serve as the Reference Safety Information for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. 9.10.9. Pregnancy If at any point a serum β-hCG pregnancy test is positive, the subject will be withdrawn from the study treatment. Details of all pregnancies in female subjects and female partners of male subjects will be collected after the start of study treatment and until 30 days after the last dose. Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to study treatment) does not meet the definition of an adverse event; however, to fulfill regulatory requirements, any pregnancy and/or pregnancy outcome should be reported via the Pregnancy Report Form to the designated Sponsor Contact mother and the fetus. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and should be reported as such (following the SAE reporting process) even if outside the SAE reporting period. 9.11. Procedures for Overdose The current edition of the IB should be referenced for overdose procedures. There is no established overdose threshold for this clinical study, nor is there any recommended specific treatment for an overdose but to provide supportive care if clinically indicated. In the event of a suspected overdose, the Investigator and/or treating physician should: 1. Closely monitor the subject for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities and follow the AE reporting process, including contacting the Medical Monitor. 2. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within 7 days from the date of the last dose of study treatment, if possible, and if requested by the Medical Monitor. 3. Document the total quantity of the excess dose, taking into consideration the duration of the overdose in the eCRF and the time frame. Subjects who overdose will be counseled on correct dosing and administration of study treatment. Decisions regarding study discontinuation, dose interruptions, or dose modifications will be made by the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject. 10.1. General Considerations All individual subject data for all randomized subjects will be presented in data listings. All efficacy and safety endpoints will be summarized by treatment group. Full details of statistical considerations and the planned analyses will be described in the study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 10.2. Determination of Sample Size Based on a 2-group Fischer’s exact test, a 1-sided significance level of 0.025, and a 2:1 randomization ratio, 330 total subjects (220 etrasimod, 110 placebo) are required to achieve at least 90% power to detect a difference of 12.5% in the primary endpoint of clinical remission between the etrasimod treatment group (18.5%) and the placebo treatment group (6.0%). 10.3. Analysis Sets All analysis sets will be defined in the SAP prior to database lock. The following analysis sets may be used in the statistical analysis: Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS will consist of all randomized subjects, who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment. Under this approach, subjects will be counted in the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of the treatment received during the study. Per Protocol Set: The Per Protocol Set will consist of all subjects in the FAS who adhere to the protocol. This set will be used in sensitivity analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints to evaluate the influence of major protocol violators and protocol deviators on the primary results. Subjects may be excluded from this set if they violate the eligibility criteria or significantly deviate from the study plan. Specific reasons for warranting exclusion from this set will be documented prior to database lock and may include, but are not limited to, study treatment noncompliance, receiving incorrect study treatment, and missing a defined number of visits while still on study. The SAP, which will be finalized prior to database lock, will be the final documentation for the Per Protocol definition. Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS): The mFAS will consist of all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment and have a baseline and at least 1 post-randomization measurement. Under this approach, subjects will be counted in the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of the treatment received during the study. Note that the mFAS can vary with endpoints since some subjects may have the needed data for inclusion in the mFAS for some endpoints but others may not. Safety Set: The Safety Set will include all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment. For this set, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment received, regardless of randomization. The Safety Set will be used for all safety analyses. 10.4. Missing Data Subjects with a lack of efficacy adverse event related will be considered as having a treatment can affect the efficacy of the study treatment, such as an immunosuppressant or corticosteroid, or who have an increase in dose over baseline levels for treatment of worsening disease symptoms will be considered nonresponders for binary responder-type endpoints thereafter or be handled by Per Protocol analysis. Subjects discussed above will be considered as having a known outcome at the analysis time point (ie, a treatment failure outcome) and not as having missing data. Subjects who discontinue the double-blind study for reasons other than a lack of efficacy adverse event related to UC will be considered as having missing data and will be handled in the primary and sensitivity analyses as follows. A full description of the handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP. Primary method of handling missing data In the primary analysis of the primary endpoint and main analyses of all binary responder -type endpoints, all subjects with missing data, regardless of reason for missingness, will be considered as nonresponders. In the main analysis of continuous or score endpoints, such as changes from baseline in MMS subscores, biomarker measures, urgency NRS, abdominal pain NRS, and health-related quality of life measures, subjects with missing data will be analyzed with their observed data only, or a mixed -effect model with repeated measures. Detailed methods will be provided in the SAP. Sensitivity analyses for missing data Sensitivity analyses will be performed under several alternative assumptions regarding missing data, ie, data missing intermittently, after discontinuation from the double-blind study for reasons other than worsening diseases, or after initiation of excluded medications. • An assumption of data missing at random (MAR) within each treatment group will be investigated. Missing data, eg, component scores of MMS at the planned assessment time points, will be imputed using multiple imputation methodology (Rubin 1987) under the MAR assumption. Binary responder -type endpoints will subsequently be computed from observed and imputed data and analyzed using the same method as in the primary analysis. Continuous endpoints will be analyzed using analysis of covariance based on observed and imputed values. • A tipping point analysis will be performed for the primary and key secondary endpoints by considering all possible combinations of the number of responders and nonresponders among subjects with missing data in each treatment group. The results of analysis for all possible combinations will be summarized graphically, depicting a boundary between combinations that result in a statistically significant treatment effect versus not statistically significant. Clinical plausibility of the combinations on the boundary will be discussed in the clinical study report to evaluate robustness of study conclusions to missing data. • A mechanism of missingness not at random will be investigated for subjects with missing data. These subjects, regardless of the randomized treatment group, will be assumed to have a similar distribution of outcomes after discontinuation as subjects outcomes as if the subjects continued on their background therapy only and accounting for the study effect observed in subjects on placebo. This will be implemented using a multiple imputation approach of Copy Reference to impute missing values, eg, component scores of MMS at the planned assessment time points. Complete descriptions of the sensitivity analyses and detailed multiple imputation method and procedures will be provided in the SAP prior to database lock. 10.5. Efficacy Endpoint Definitions The following definitions will be used to assess efficacy outcomes: • Clinical response: A ≥ 2-point and ≥ 30% decrease from baseline in MMS, and a ≥ 1-point decrease from baseline in RB subscore or an absolute RB subscore ≤ 1 • Clinical remission: SF subscore = 0 (or = 1 with a ≥ 1-point decrease from baseline), RB subscore = 0, and ES ≤ 1 (excluding friability) • Endoscopic improvement: ES of ≤ 1 (excluding friability) • Endoscopic normalization: ES = 0 • Mucosal healing: ES of ≤ 1 (excluding friability) with histologic remission measured by a Geboes Index score < 2.0 • Symptomatic remission: SF subscore = 0 (or = 1 with a ≥ 1-point decrease from baseline) and RB subscore = 0 • Complete symptomatic remission: SF subscore = 0 and RB subscore = 0 • Symptomatic response: Decrease from baseline ≥ 30% in composite RB and SF subscores • Noninvasive clinical response: A ≥ 30% decrease from baseline in composite RB and SF, and a ≥ 1-point decrease from baseline in RB subscore or an absolute RB subscore ≤ 1 • Histologic improvement: Geboes Index score < 3.1 • Histologic remission: Geboes Index score < 2.0 • Clinical remission using Total Mayo Clinic score: Total Mayo Clinic Score of ≤ 2 points with no individual subscore of > 1 point • Clinical response using Total Mayo Clinic score: A ≥ 3-point and ≥ 30% decrease from baseline in Total Mayo Clinic score, and a ≥ 1-point decrease from baseline in RB subscore or an absolute RB subscore ≤ 1 10.5.1. Calculation of Modified Mayo Score Component Scores In general, the MMS symptom scores will be computed from the eDiary data within 7 days prior to the target analysis time point (ie, Week 12). Complete details of the MMS symptom score computation method are provided in Section 9.3.10 and Section 9.4.2. The primary efficacy endpoints will evaluate etrasimod versus placebo in: • The proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission at Week 12 Clinical remission is based on the MMS as defined in Section 10.5. 10.7. Secondary Endpoints Mucosal healing is based on the MMS and Geboes Index, histologic response and remission are based on the Geboes Index, and all other endpoints are based on MMS as defined in Section 10.5. 10.7.1. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The key secondary efficacy endpoints are: • The proportion of subjects achieving endoscopic improvement at Week 12 • The proportion of subjects achieving symptomatic remission at Week 12 • The proportion of subjects with mucosal healing at Week 12 10.7.2. Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The other secondary endpoints are: • The proportion of subjects achieving clinical response at Week 12 • The proportion of subjects achieving endoscopic normalization at Week 12 • The proportion of subjects achieving symptomatic remission at Weeks 2, 4, 8 • The proportion of subjects achieving complete symptomatic remission at each study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12) • The proportion of subjects achieving noninvasive clinical response at each study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12) • The proportion of subjects achieving symptomatic response at each study visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12) 10.9. Other Efficacy -Related Endpoints 10.9.1. Health-Related Quality of Life • Scores and change from baseline to Week 12 in the following: − IBDQ total score − UC-PRO/SS − SF-36, version 2, physical and mental component and domain scores − WPAI-UC − Urgency NRS − Abdominal pain NRS • The proportion of subjects with UC-related hospitalizations • The proportion of subjects requiring UC-related surgeries, including colectomy 10.9.2. Pharmacokinetics • Plasma concentrations of etrasimod, and if warranted M3 (AR503641) and other metabolite(s) of interest, will be assessed from samples collected prior to dosing and 4 hours (± 15 minutes) post-dose (after 12-lead ECG) on Week 0/Day 1 • Plasma concentrations of etrasimod, and if warranted M3 (AR503641) and other metabolite(s) of interest, will be assessed from samples collected prior to dosing (trough) at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and the 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up visits A descriptive summary of observed plasma concentration will be displayed by time and by treatment group. The Safety Set will be used to analyze plasma levels. Full details of PK analysis will be provided in the SAP. 10.9.3. Biomarkers • Change from baseline in level of fecal calprotectin at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 • Change from baseline in level of hs-CRP at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 • Change and percentage change from baseline in lymphocyte counts at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 10.10. Subgroup Analyses The following major subgroup analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints will be performed in order to explore whether the treatment effects are consistent across different subgroups. The SAP will provide a complete list and definition of the subgroups and analysis • Age: > or ≤ median age, ≥ or < 65 years • Race • Baseline oral corticosteroid usage (yes or no) • Naïve to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy at study entry (yes or no) • Baseline disease activity (MMS: 4 to 6 or 7 to 9) • Baseline fecal calprotectin > or ≤ median value • Baseline CRP > or ≤ median value • Baseline Total Mayo score ≤ 8 vs > 8 10.11. Safety Endpoints • Incidence and severity of adverse events • Incidence and severity of laboratory abnormalities, and change from baseline in laboratory values (to include hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis) • Incidence of clinically significant vital sign abnormalities and changes from baseline 10.12. Testing Strategy 10.12.1. Efficacy Analysis The primary analysis of the proportion-based efficacy endpoints will be carried out using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method, stratified by (a) naïve to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy at study entry (yes or no), (b) baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and (c) baseline disease activity (MMS: 4 to 6 or 7 to 9). Results will be expressed as the number of subjects in remission, remission percentages, difference in remission percentages, odds ratio, and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. There are multiple null hypotheses for the comparison of etrasimod and placebo in the primary and key secondary endpoints. The family-wise type-I error rate will be controlled at a fixed α level at 0.025 (1-sided) using the following testing procedure. First, the whole α will be spent on testing the primary endpoint. Only if the primary null hypothesis is rejected at the α level, can testing proceed for the 3 key secondary endpoints. The method for such testing will be specified in the SAP, and it will control for the multiplicity of the 3 key secondary endpoints. Any key secondary endpoint that fails to be significant at the α level by this method to control multiplicity will be considered exploratory and thereby would only have nominal p-values. All other endpoints will be evaluated at α level of significance and reported with nominal p-values, without multiplicity adjustment. Full details of the efficacy analysis will be documented prior to database lock in the SAP. All safety data will be listed and summarized by treatment group. All TEAEs will be coded using the latest version of MedDRA and tabulated by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Incidence of adverse events, SAEs, and adverse events leading to discontinuation will be summarized and presented in descending order of frequency. Associated laboratory parameters such as hepatic enzymes, renal function, and hematology values will be grouped and presented together. Individual subject values will be listed and values outside of the standard reference range will be flagged. Shift tables and analyses of changes from baseline will be produced. The change from baseline for each of the vital signs and 12-lead ECG parameters will be summarized. Incidence of abnormal vital signs parameters and outlier 12-lead ECG results will be tabulated. 10.13. Interim Analysis Not applicable 11.1.

Approval from the committee must be documented in a letter to the Investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, documents reviewed, and the date on which the committee met and granted the approval. All documents subject to review during the study, including any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB/IEC approval, must also be submitted to the committee for approval prior to implementation. The Investigator must also provide periodic reports as required and promptly report important safety information (ie, SAEs new information that may adversely affect the safety of study subjects or the conduct of the study, deviations from or changes in the protocol to eliminate immediate harm to study subjects) and protocol violations, as appropriate, to the IRB/IEC. As part of the Investigator’s written application to the IRB/IEC, the Investigator should provide the committee with a current copy of the etrasimod IB. If the IB is updated during the study, the Investigator should supply an updated copy to the committee. 11.3. Informed Consent and Assent The Investigator will fully inform the subject of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the approval of the study by the IRB/IEC. Before informed consent/assent (parent or legal guardian must provide consent for a subject < 18 years of age who has assented to participate in the study or as required per local regulations) may be obtained, the Investigator should provide the subject ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether to participate. Prior to a subject’s participation in the study, the IRB/IEC-approved ICF must be signed and personally dated by the subject and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. If a subject is unable to read, an impartial witness will be present during the entire informed consent discussion. The written ICF and any other written information to be provided to subjects should be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent. Any revised written ICF or study materials to be available and/or supplied to subjects should receive the IRB/IEC’s approval in advance of use. The subject will be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s be documented. During a subject’s participation in the study, the subject will receive an updated version of the IRB/IEC-approved signed and dated consent document, as applicable, and any updates to the IRB/IEC-approved written information provided to subjects. 11.4. Confidentiality All information generated in this study is considered highly confidential and must not be disclosed to any person or entity not directly involved with the study unless prior written consent is provided from the Sponsor. Prior to study participation, the Investigator shall inform the subject that the monitor(s), auditor(s), IRB/IEC, and the regulatory authorities will be granted direct access to the subject’s original medical records for verification of clinical study procedures and/or data, and that, by signing a written ICF, the subject is authorizing such access. In addition, prior to study participation, the subject must be informed that the records identifying the subject will not be made publicly available; if the results of the study are published, the subject’s identity will remain confidential. 11.5. Protocol Compliance The Investigator/institution will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol agreed to by the Sponsor and regulatory authorities (if applicable) and that was approved by the IRB/IEC. The Investigator/institution and the Sponsor should sign the protocol, or if applicable an alternative contract, to confirm agreement. The Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes to, the protocol without agreement by the Sponsor and prior review and documented approval from the IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate immediate hazard(s) to study subjects or when the change involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (eg, change in monitor, change of telephone number). When an important deviation from the protocol is deemed necessary for an individual subject, the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor for the study. Such contact must be made as soon as possible to permit a review by the Sponsor to determine the impact of the deviation on the subject’s participation and/or the assessment of safety or efficacy in the study. Any significant protocol deviations affecting subject eligibility and/or safety must be reported by Investigator or site delegate to the IRB/IEC and regulatory authorities, as applicable, prior to implementation. The Investigator should document and explain any deviation from the approved protocol. Quality assurance and quality control systems shall be implemented and maintained with written SOPs to ensure that the study is conducted, and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the study protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Quality control shall be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and have been processed correctly. An agreement must be secured from all involved parties to ensure direct access to all study-related sites, source documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor and/or designee and inspection by regulatory authorities. 12.1. Training of Study Site Personnel Prior to study activities being initiated at the study site, the Sponsor or designee will train study site personnel on the protocol and applicable procedures. Training must be documented. Note: If new study site personnel are assigned to the study after the initial training, study sites should contact the study monitor to coordinate training. Qualified study personnel may conduct training, as appropriate. Training of new study personnel must also be documented. 12.2. Monitoring Study site monitoring is conducted to ensure the study is progressing as expected, the rights and well-being of human subjects are protected, the reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol, with GCP and with applicable regulatory requirements and local laws. Protocol deviations identified will be documented. Details of study site monitoring are documented in the study Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) or similar document. The CMP describes in detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed (eg, targeted and/or risk based), and the distribution of monitoring reports. Monitoring may include a study site selection visit, which may be conducted in person or via communication media (eg, teleconference, online meeting) or may be waived in accordance with policy and procedures being followed for the study, if appropriate. Monitoring will include a study site initiation visit, interim monitoring visit(s), and a study site closeout visit. An interim monitoring visit may be combined with a closeout visit, if applicable. 12.3. Audit An audit of one or more participating study sites may be performed independently of, and separately from, routine monitoring to evaluate clinical study conduct and compliance with the protocol, SOPs, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements. 13.1. Data Management 13.1.1. Case Report Forms An eCRF must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this study. These forms will be used to transmit information collected during the study to the Sponsor and regulatory authorities, as applicable. The documentation related to the validation of the eCRFs will be maintained in the Trial Master File (TMF). The TMF will be maintained by the CRO and the Sponsor. The Investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files. These subject files will serve as source data for the study. All eCRF data required by this protocol will be recorded by study site personnel. All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by source documentation. The Investigator or an authorized member of the Investigator’s staff will make any necessary corrections to the eCRF. All changed information, including the date and person performing the corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which will be part of the electronic data capture system. For any correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided. The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for completeness and acceptability by Sponsor personnel (or their representatives). The Sponsor (or their representatives) will also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the study in order to verify eCRF entries. The Investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide his or her electronic signature and date to the eCRFs as evidence thereof. 13.1.2. Source Documents Per regulatory requirements, the Investigator or designee will maintain accurate and up-to-date study documentation, including source documentation for each study subject.

APPENDIX 1: SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS Table 7: Schedule of Assessments – Screening and Induction Treatment Period Evaluation Screening 12-Week Treatment Period Period Evaluation Screening 12-Week Treatment Period Period a All visits beyond W0/D1 may be virtual/hybrid visits (Section 9.6). Subjects discontinuing prior to Week 12 should have an Early Termination (ET) visit within 7 days of the last study treatment administration and before initiation of any new treatments. For subjects who complete Week 12 and wish to enter the APD334-303 OLE study, the Week 12 visit will be used to assess eligibility for the APD334-303 OLE study. b For subjects not participating in the APD334-303 OLE study, a follow-up visit will be performed at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the last administration of study treatment. If the ET or Study Completion visit is ≥ 2 weeks after the last dose of study treatment, the 2-Week Follow-Up visit is not required; however, the 4-Week Follow-Up visit should be scheduled and completed. If the ET or Study Completion visit is ≥ 4 weeks after the last administration of study treatment, the 4-Week Follow-Up visit is not required. If the absolute peripheral lymphocyte count is not within normal limits at the 4-Week Follow-Up visit, subjects should return for CBC with differential according to local standard of care (captured as subsequent Follow-Up visit or unscheduled visit). c Medical history, including prior and ongoing medication use, will be collected during screening and should be updated for any new conditions or medications as needed prior to dosing at the D1 visit (Section 9.3.5). d A chest X-ray taken within the previous 6 months from the Screening Visit may also be used. e All subjects will complete TB screening to determine eligibility (refer to Appendix 2). The QuantiFERON TB Gold and tuberculin skin test should not be performed in subjects previously diagnosed with TB infection. The TB questionnaire will be completed for all subjects during the Screening Period and at every study visit for subjects residing in countries with a high TB burden or MDR TB as identified by the WHO. For subjects who are receiving TB prophylaxis treatment, the TB questionnaire will be completed at every study visit (until TB prophylaxis treatment course is completed). f Subjects will be tested for HIV antibodies as well as HBV and HCV infection at screening (Section 9.10.7.1.3). g Subjects will begin eDiary entries beginning the first day of screening after eDiary training is completed. The eDiary should be completed daily to capture data including daily SF and RB (the 2 subject-reported outcome measures contributing to the calculation of the MMS), and study treatment administration. The subject eDiary will be reviewed by study site staff at each treatment visit. h The MMS will be calculated electronically at the Day 1 and Week 12/Early termination visits. The subscores for SF and RB are derived from the subject eDiary entries using the scores from the 3 most recent consecutive days within the 7 days prior to the day of bowel preparation (excluding the day of bowel preparation), averaged and rounded to the nearest integer (Section 9.3.10). i Stool frequency and RB subject-reported outcomes will be recorded daily using electronic subject eDiaries. The RB and SF subscores will be calculated as indicated in Section 9.4.2. j Safety vital signs (resting heart rate and systolic and diastolic BP, body temperature, and respiratory rate) taken with subjects in the sitting position will be performed at Screening and prior to randomization on Week 0/Day 1 (baseline). If the subject’s heart rate is < 50 bpm, or systolic BP < 90 mm Hg, or diastolic BP < 55 mm Hg, or has symptoms of low HR or low BP, the subject must not be randomized and should be considered a Screen Failure. k On Day 1, vital sign assessments will be conducted as described in Section 9.4.2.1. l Safety 12-lead ECGs with the subject in the supine position will be obtained prior to blood sample collection at Screening and prior to randomization on Week 0/Day 1 (baseline). Subjects with a 12-lead ECG showing a second or third-degree AV block, periods of asystole > 3 seconds, PR interval > 200 ms, QTcF ≥ 450 ms (men) or QTcF ≥ 470 ms (women) must not be randomized and should be considered screen failures. m After dosing on Day 1, a 12-lead ECG with the subject in the supine position will be performed 4 hours (± 15 minutes) post-dose as described in Section 9.4.2.1. n Complete physical examination (including assessments of the skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, body weight, and height [height collected at Screening Visit only]) should be performed at screening and the Week 12/ET visit. All other visits during the 12-Week Treatment Period should have a focused (complaints, signs, and symptoms) physical examination. o During the specified full physical examinations (screening and Week 12/ET visits), specific systems (eyes, liver, skin and joints) will be examined for EIMs. p A PFT will include FEV1 and FVC measurements. When available, DLCO measurements will also be performed (when DLCO is not available, sites should consult the Sponsor or Sponsor’s delegate). q The Screening pulmonary function test (PFT) should be done within the 28-day Screening Period. PFTs should be performed ± 7 days in the study treatment period and posttreatment period (ie, 2-Week Follow-Up visit). PFTs occurring at the ET visit that are within 4 weeks of the last assessment will only be required if clinically indicated. The 2-Week Follow-Up visit assessment is only required if clinically indicated. Details regarding additional PFTs are provided in Section 9.10.4. r The Screening OCT should be performed within the 28-day Screening Period. Subsequent ophthalmoscopy with OCT should be performed ± 7 days in the study treatment period and posttreatment period (ie, 2-Week Follow-Up visit). OCTs occurring at the ET visit that are within 4 weeks of the last assessment will only be required if clinically indicated. The 2-Week Follow-Up visit assessment is only required if clinically indicated. Details regarding ophthalmoscopy and OCT assessments are provided in Section 9.10.5. s Urine drug screen according to Table 6. t Only for women of childbearing potential. Serum β-hCG test required at screening; urine pregnancy test at all other visits. If at any point there is a positive urine β-hCG test, the subject will have study treatment interrupted and a serum sample submitted to the central laboratory for β-hCG testing (Section 9.10.7.1.2). u Clinical laboratory tests will include serum chemistry, hematology (including coagulation), urinalysis, and hs-CRP. Screening samples should be obtained and results must be available and reviewed prior to the first dose of study treatment. On other study visits, samples should be obtained prior to the daily dosing. v Stool sample is for fecal calprotectin (Screening, Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) and bacterial culture, ova and parasite evaluation, and C. difficile assay at screening and at any point in the study when a subject becomes symptomatic, including worsening or return of disease activity. w To be read by a blinded central reader. Proctosigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy should be performed prior to randomization to allow central reader review (may take approximately 5 to 12 days) and confirmation of eligibility (Section 9.8.1.1). If the ET visit is within 4 weeks of the last sigmoidoscopy and biopsy, these procedures do not need to be repeated. x Pharmacokinetic blood samples are to be collected pre-dose, 4 hours (± 15 minutes) post-dose on Week 0/Day 1 (PK sample to be collected after 12-lead ECG), and pre-dose (for trough level, within the 60-minute period prior to dosing) on all other indicated days. A PK sample should be taken, if possible, at the time of any SAE or adverse event leading to study treatment discontinuation. In addition, for subjects not enrolling into the APD334-303 study, a blood sample for PK should be drawn at the 2-Week and 4-Week Follow-Up visits. For all PK blood draws, the time of the last dose should be documented. y Blood samples for biomarkers should be collected on the indicated days prior to the daily dosing as applicable. Biomarker sample collection is not required at ET visit. z All concomitant medications and procedures should be collected from Day 1 (pre-dose) through the safety reporting period (Section 6.7). aa Study treatment should be dispensed at Week 12 if the subject continues treatment in the 40-Week Treatment Period. Additionally, subjects who consent and are eligible for the APD334-303 OLE study but do not enter the OLE on the same day as the Week 12 visit may also be dispensed study treatment. bb On days with scheduled study visits, subjects should not take their dose of study treatment at home in order to complete pre-dose study procedures. The dose will be taken at the study site after blood draws for PK and after all pre-dose assessments and procedures have been completed.

Their medical history review must include specific questions about a history of TB or known occupational or other personal exposure to individuals with active TB. Subjects should be asked about past testing for TB, including chest radiograph results and results of interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA, eg, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, T-SPOT TB) or response to tuberculin skin test (TST) and history of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination. a. Subjects without a history of latent or active TB who have a negative IGRA or TST result at screening are eligible to enroll in the study. b. A TB questionnaire will be completed for all subjects (refer to questionnaire below) during the Screening Period. c. For subjects residing in countries with a high burden of TB or MDR TB as identified by WHO, the TB screening questionnaire will be completed at every study visit (per protocol Schedule of Assessments). For subjects who are receiving TB prophylaxis treatment the TB questionnaire will be completed at every study visit (until TB prophylaxis treatment course is completed). This questionnaire will monitor for any emergent symptoms of active TB and compliance with any TB prophylaxis treatment. − For a complete list of TB high burden and MDR TB high burden countries during the period 2016 to 2020, visit: − http://www.stoptb.org/countries/tbdata.asp − https://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/high_tb_burdencountrylists 2016-2020.pdf?ua=1 d. The IGRA or TST is NOT required at screening (or annually) for subjects with a history of active/latent TB infection. − Subjects with past or current history of active TB, regardless of treatment history, are excluded from enrollment. − Subjects with a history of latent TB infection diagnosed prior to screening must have documentation of treatment with at least four weeks of an acceptable TB prophylaxis treatment regimen to qualify for enrollment. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to verify the adequacy of previous TB treatment and provide appropriate documentation (Direct Observation Therapy report where available). e. Acceptable TB prophylaxis treatment regimens for latent TB is defined according to local country guidelines. If no local country guidelines for the treatment of latent TB exist, WHO guidelines must be followed. f. Subjects with a newly identified positive IGRA (one retest is allowed with approval from the Medical Monitor per Section 9.3.1) or TST result at Screening must be considered a Screen Failure, however they are eligible for rescreening once they undergo an evaluation to rule out active TB (chest x-ray to rule out pulmonary TB) and initiate an acceptable TB prophylaxis treatment regimen for latent TB at least 4 weeks prior to rescreening (with a plan to complete the TB treatment course during MDR TB: A chest CT scan should be performed to rule out current/past pulmonary TB in the event the chest x-ray is equivocal. g. An assessment of adequacy of the TB prophylaxis treatment regimen and duration of treatment must be performed by an infectious disease consultant or physician TB expert. h. IGRA and TST interpretation − Subjects will be considered to have a negative diagnostic test for TB if at least one of the following circumstances applies: − Negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. − Combination of a negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and negative purified protein derivative (PPD) TST (in countries where IGRA is not considered a validated test). − A combination of two indeterminant QuantiFERON-TB Gold tests and a negative PPD TST (in countries where IGRA is not considered a validated test). An indeterminant IGRA test result should be repeated. In the event that the second IGRA test result is also indeterminate, the subject may be enrolled without treatment for latent TB if his/her chest radiograph shows no abnormality suggestive of TB (active or old, inactive TB) and the subject has no additional risk factors for TB as determined by a physician TB expert physician. − If the IGRA is not considered a validated test or is not registered for use in the subject’s country, a negative TST result is required to rule out latent TB infection. − A positive TST reaction is ≥ 10 mm of induration, or ≥ 5 mm of induration for subjects receiving equivalent of prednisone > 15 mg/day for any medical conditions and subjects residing in countries identified by WHO as a high TB burden country or high MDR TB burden country. i.

Geboes Grading System The Geboes Grading System is a stepwise grading system used for the evaluation of microscopic inflammation and histopathologic disease activity in UC. The microscopic appearance of the mucosa is categorized into 6 grades. A decrease of the Geboes Score grading system to Grade zero (0) or one (1) indicates mucosal healing (Geboes 2000). Nancy Histological Index The Nancy Histological Index is a validated index for assessing histological disease activity in UC. It is composed of three histological items defining five grades of disease activity: absence of significant histological disease (Grade 0), chronic inflammatory infiltrate with no acute inflammatory infiltrate (Grade 1), mildly active disease (Grade 2), moderately active disease (Grade 3), and severely active disease (Grade 4). The presence of ulceration on the biopsy specimen corresponds to severely active disease (Grade 4). If there is no ulceration, acute inflammatory cells infiltrate (presence of neutrophils) is assessed. Moderate or severe acute inflammatory cells infiltrate corresponds to moderately active disease (Grade 3), while mild acute inflammatory cells infiltrate correspond to mildly active disease (Grade 2). If there is no acute inflammatory cells infiltrate, assessment of chronic inflammatory infiltrate (lymphocytes and plasmacytes) is made. A biopsy specimen showing moderate or marked chronic inflammatory infiltrate corresponds to moderate or marked chronic acute inflammatory infiltrate (Grade 1). A biopsy specimen showing mild or no chronic inflammatory infiltrate corresponds to absence of significant histological disease (Grade 0) (Marchal-Bressenot 2017). Robarts Histopathology Index The Robarts Histopathology Index (RHI) is an evaluative index, derived from the Geboes score, that is designed to be reproducible and responsive to clinically meaningful change in disease activity over time. The total RHI score ranges from 0 (no disease activity) to 33 (severe disease activity) and is calculated as follows: RHI = 1 × Chronic inflammatory infiltrate + 2 × Lamina propria neutrophils + 3 × Neutrophilis in epithelium + 5 × Erosion or ulceration (Mosli 2017). PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY If a subject exhibits signs and symptoms suspicious for PML, the Investigator must interrupt study treatment and perform a targeted neurologic examination to assess for signs of PML, which are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and may include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs or difficulty with walking or writing or fine motor skills, disturbance of vision, changes in thinking, memory and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes, paresthesia/anesthesia (of any domain: peripheral to central), dysarthria (expressive aphasia), and/or agnosia (receptive aphasia). Consultation with a local neurologist may be warranted, as presented in the PML case evaluation algorithm in Figure 2. The Medical Monitor should be informed of any suspected cases of PML and, if needed, will facilitate Investigator/local neurologist consultation with PML medical experts on the independent adjudication committee. Figure 2: Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Case Evaluation Algorithm CE, contrast-enhanced; CSF, cerebral spinal fluid; IAC, independent adjudication committee; IP, investigational product; JCV, John Cunningham Virus; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PML, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; r/o, rule out. Note: IP dosing may resume, and no further evaluation is needed if the Investigator assessment reveals no objective signs of PML, the local neurologist confirms that the patient does not have PML, or the IAC’s review of the evidence concludes that PML is ruled out.
