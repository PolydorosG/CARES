Document History Amendment 1 21 October 2014 Figures 1 and 3: Study Schematic updated to include the 2 additional safety analyses during the Randomized Phase 2 component. Added in all appropriate sections that patients with >30% BM blasts OR a rapidly progressive increase in the proportion of BM blasts at any point during the trial, must discontinue the study drug combination and enter follow-up. Added in all appropriate sections that two safety analyses will be performed following commencement of the randomized Phase 2 component of the study in order to carry out an early assessment of the safety profile of the study treatment combination in addition to the one performed at the end of the lead-in phase. One analysis will be carried out after 12 patients have completed 2 cycles of treatment, and one after 24 patients have completed 2 cycles of treatment. The EDMC will review the results of both analyses. Deleted all references to allowing the continuation of single agent PF-04449913/placebo in the event that azacitidine is permanently discontinued for reasons other than objective disease progression, patient refusal, or consent withdrawal. Updated in all appropriate sections that the Patient Dosing Diary for PF-04449913/placebo will now be required for all treatment cycles. Previously the Patient Dosing Diary was optional after Cycle 6. End of Treatment Visit added to Table 4. Document Version Date Summary of Changes The following Exclusion Criteria was added: “Patients with AML who are candidates for standard induction chemotherapy”. The following clarification of the definition of a missed dose was added to Section 5.5.1 General Guidelines in reference to PF-04449913: “If a patient forgets to take their dose at the regularly scheduled time, and if less than 10 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, that dose should be taken as soon as possible. If more than 10 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, the dose should be skipped and the patient should continue on their normal dosing schedule.” For clarification the following sentence was added to Section 5.5.2.3.2: PF-04449913 or Placebo: “PF-04449913/placebo treatment should be interrupted for ANC <100/mm3 and /or platelets < 10,000/mm3 regardless of when it occurs.” In Section 5.5.2.3.2.

This multi-center open-label Phase 1b study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of glasdegib when combined with azacitidine in patients with previously untreated Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML). This clinical study includes two components: (a) a safety lead-in cohort (LIC) and (b) an expansion phase with two cohorts. Indication Safety Lead-In Cohort (LIC) Previously untreated adult patients with Intermediate-2 or High-Risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), AML with 20%-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification, and CMML. Expansion (a) Previously untreated adult patients with Intermediate, High, or Very High risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R) and (b) AML patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (according to WHO 2016 classification). Background and Rationale Disease Overview MDS is a heterogeneous group of myeloid disorders defined by a common set of features, of which the most prominent is morphologic bone marrow and peripheral blood dysplasia associated with inefficient hematopoiesis, the development of peripheral cytopenias and an increased risk of transformation to AML. The incidence of MDS is around 4–5 per 100,000 individuals annually worldwide, with the prevalence increasing with age. The French-American-British (FAB) classification system established in 1982 was the first approach allowing for a reliable diagnosis of a disease group that had previously been termed pre-leukemia. In 2001 the WHO classification of hematopoietic neoplasms was introduced, subsequently updated in 2008, and most recently in 2016. The principal modifications with respect to the FAB classification were to consider patients with 20% or more bone marrow or peripheral blood blasts as having AML, and to remove the CMML subtype and place it in a newly created category termed Myelodysplastic/ Myeloproliferative Neoplasms The standard of care treatment of higher risk (Intermediate-2 and High-Risk) MDS and AML with 20-30% bone marrow (BM) blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, has previously been focused on intensive chemotherapy using anthracycline and cytarabine (Ara-C) combinations but this approach has led to lower complete response rates and a shorter response duration as compared to treatment outcomes in patients with de-novo AML ≥30% BM blasts. In response to this unmet medical need, several multi-center randomized studies comparing hypomethylating agent (HMA) treatment to supportive care have been conducted and demonstrated delayed progression to AML, with prolongation of median progression-free survival (PFS) of between 3 to 8 months as compared with best supportive therapy. Azacitidine was approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for the treatment of all MDS subtypes according to the FAB classification. This approval was based on the overall response rate defined as Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) observed in the randomized CALGB-9221 study. The overall response rate (CR + PR) was 15.7% in the azacitidine treatment group, and there were no responders in the control group. In 2009, results from the international AZA-001 trial, phase 3 randomized trial comparing azacitidine to conventional care regimens (CCR) in patients with Intermediate-2 or High Risk MDS, showed that the median overall survival (OS) was significantly prolonged in the azacitidine arm as compared with the CCR arm (24.5 months for azacitidine vs. 15.0 months for CCR; hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43–0.77) despite a low CR rate (17% in the azacitidine arm vs 8% in the CCR arm). Based on this observed survival benefit, azacitidine was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adults who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and have Intermediate-2 or High-Risk MDS, CMML with 10-29% marrow blasts and lacking a myeloproliferative component, and AML with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia according to WHO 2008. AML is a genetically heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterized by multiple mutations and epigenetic dysregulation at the time of diagnosis that evolves with treatment, resulting in treatment resistance, disease relapse, and reduced survival. It is estimated that there will be 21,380 new cases and 10,500 deaths from AML in the United States in 2017. Existing standards of care such as cytarabine + anthracycline (7+3), or hypomethylating agents like decitabine and azacitidine, can induce CR in 5-70% of patients; however, remissions are not durable and disease relapse occurs in up to 60% of patients. For AML patients unable to receive intensive chemotherapy, existing standard treatments like Low Dose Cytarabine (LDAC) are associated with response rates <20% and median OS times of 5-6.5 months. Hypomethylating agents, azacitidine and decitabine, although not approved in the US specifically for AML, have shown improved OS vs LDAC in AML patients who were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy. Reducing the incidence of disease progression to prolong survival remains the highest unmet medical need in the treatment of AML patients. In 2015, results from the international randomized phase 3 AZA-AML trial comparing azacitidine to CCRs in patients aged ≥65 years with newly diagnosed or secondary AML overall survival (mOS) in the azacitidine arm of 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.0-12.7) versus (vs) 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.6) in the CCR arm (HR=0.85; 95% CI, 0.69-1.03; stratified log-rank p=0.1009), although the primary endpoint was not met. The CR rate in the azacitidine arm was lower than the CCR arm (19.5% vs 21.9%). The 1-year survival rate with azacitidine was 46.5% compared with 34.2% with conventional therapy (95% CI, 3.5%-21.0%). Based on the observed survival benefit, the EU expanded the approval of azacitidine in AML to adult patients aged 65 years or older who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with >30% myeloblasts according to the WHO classification; previously, the indication covered AML patients with <30% blasts. Despite the modest increase in mOS and low CR rate, azacitidine is currently the standard of care for AML patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy. New treatments are needed to improve outcomes in this older AML population. Rationale for Glasdegib/Azacitidine Combination Therapy Glasdegib was initially evaluated as a single-agent therapy in patients with select myeloid malignancies, and had a manageable safety profile at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 100 mg once a day (QD) per os with early signs of efficacy observed in AML, MDS, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and Myelofibrosis (MF). In the safety LIC of the current study, 12 patients with previously untreated high risk MDS (n=7), AML with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia (n=3), erythroleukemia (n=1), and CMML (n=1) were treated at the glasdegib, 100 mg QD per os, in combination with azacitidine 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days subcutaneously (SC) every 28 days. An internal safety review team reviewed the data from this component of the study and determined that the safety profile of the combination treatment appeared to be consistent with what was expected for glasdegib or azacitidine alone, with no unexpected toxicities identified, and deemed acceptable to proceed to the next phase of development. Preliminary efficacy data from the LIC showed 5 patients responded: 3 patients with CR, 2 patients with marrow complete remission (mCR): of note, after the data cutoff date, the complete blood count of 1 of the patients with mCR had normalized, consistent with CR. Of the 5 patients who responded, 4 responses occurred on or before Day 100. Of the 4 patients with CR (including the mCR patient who achieved a CR after the data cutoff date), 3 patients had AML (75% CR rate vs the historical control for azacitidine alone, 19.5%) and 1 patient had MDS (14% CR rate vs the historical control for azacitidine alone, 17%). A further 4 patients had stable disease (SD). No evidence of drug-drug interaction (DDI) was noted. As of September 2016, mOS had not been reached. In the Phase 1b part of Study B1371003, 52 patients with AML or higher risk MDS were treated with glasdegib 100 mg or 200 mg by mouth daily (PO Qday) in combination with low dose cytarabine (LDAC) (n=23), decitabine (n=7), or 7 + 3 (n=22). Median OS in the combined AML and MDS patients were 4.4 months (80% CI: 2.5, 6.6), 11.5 months (80% CI: 4.5, 17.4) (vs historical mOS of 7.7 months with decitabine alone), and 34.7 months (80% CI: 14.5, not reached), respectively, in the 3 treatment arms. Of the AML patients treated in combination with decitabine, 2/5 (40%) responded (1 CR and 1 complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)). Of the high-risk MDS patients treated in combination with chemotherapy was consistent with what was seen in an earlier monotherapy study in patients with selected myeloid malignancies. A similar population of newly diagnosed elderly AML patients was enrolled into a Phase 3 study of decitabine vs supportive care vs low dose cytarabine where the CR+ CRi rate was 25.6% in the decitabine only arm. In the Phase 2 portion of Study B1371003, a prospective, randomized (2:1), open-label clinical trial in 132 previously untreated AML patients who were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy based on age or other risk factors and higher risk MDS, the addition of glasdegib 100 mg orally PO Qday to LDAC vs LDAC alone resulted in a significant improvement in OS (mOS 8.8 months (80% CI: 6.9, 9.9) vs 4.9 months (80% CI: 3.5, 6.0); hazard ratio [HR] 0.513 [80 % CI: 0.394-0.666]; 1-sided p-value=0.0004). The CR/CRi rate for AML patients in the glasdegib + LDAC arm was 25% (80% CI: 19.1, 30.9) vs 4.5% (80% CI: 0.5, 8.6) in the LDAC alone arm. The safety/tolerability profile was consistent with that in elderly AML patients receiving chemotherapy. Glasdegib, which targets the Hh pathway component Smoothened (SMO), is an oral inhibitor of the Hh pathway currently in clinical development for patients with myeloid malignancies. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway regulates cell differentiation and self-renewal in the developing embryo, and is typically silenced in adult tissues. Aberrant Hh signaling in the post-embryonic stage may result from mutations in key pathway genes, non-mutational mechanisms related to the secretion of Hh ligands, or signals from cells in the tumor microenvironment. Aberrant Hh signaling has been identified in a variety of human myeloid malignancies, and specifically in leukemia stem cells (LSCs). In a preclinical MDS model, blocking the Hh pathway with SMO inhibitors in combination with the hypomethylating agent (HMA) azacitidine generated synergy in vitro with growth inhibition in primary malignant myeloid cells ex vivo. Upregulation of Hh pathway components has been observed in chemoresistant AML cell lines in vitro, and pharmacological inhibition of the Hh pathway resulted in decreased multi-drug resistance 1(MDR-1) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression in these cells. In nonclinical models SMO, acting via its effector GLI2, has been implicated in the maintenance of LSC dormancy and associated resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy, while inhibition of SMO via glasdegib can cause LSCs to re-enter the cell cycle. Recrudescence of LSCs is prevented in preclinical hosts pre-treated with Hh pathway inhibitors, including glasdegib. Consistent with these effects, glasdegib sensitized AML cells to cytosine arabinoside, and abrogated resistance to cytosine arabinoside in AML cells co-cultured with stromal cells. The clinical safety database of glasdegib contains over 300 patients with hematologic malignancies who received the recommended dose of at least 100 mg daily. The safety profile observed so far appears consistent with what has been reported for other marketed smoothened (SMO) inhibitors and the underlying chemotherapy backbones when administered in combination. Glasdegib has shown clinical activity in patients with higher risk MDS and AML patients who were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy when combined with other treatments, such as azacitidine and decitabine and demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS when combined with     Expansion An open-label expansion consisting of approximately 60 patients with previously untreated Intermediate, High, or Very High risk MDS per IPSS-R (n=30) and AML patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (n=30). Patients will receive glasdegib at a starting dose of 100 mg QD given orally in combination with azacitidine per local label or per the Investigational Product Manual (or Summary of Product Characteristics [SPC]). Azacitidine may be administered by SC injection or intravenous (IV) infusion at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days every 28 days. Alternate dosing schedules to administer the 7 azacitidine doses to accommodate subject and treatment center availability are allowed. The primary objective of the expansion component of the study is to demonstrate that the CR rate of the combination treatment in each patient population is reasonably better than the historical CR rate for azacitidine alone using a Bayesian decision criterion allowing early stopping for futility. Analysis of specific safety criteria will also be performed to evaluate stopping enrollment for a specifc cohort when the rate of pre-defined safety events of interest surpasses a pre-defined threshold. Figure 1. Schematic of Study Design *MDS patients enrolled in the safety lead-in component must have Intermediate-2 or High-Risk disease according to IPSS. MDS patients enrolled in the expansion component must have Intermediate, High, or Very High risk disease according to IPSS-R. Study Assessments Patients will be followed for efficacy throughout the study by means of bone marrow aspirates. Following study entry, bone marrow biopsies will only be required if adequate bone marrow aspirates are not obtained. A CR or PR needs to be confirmed at least 4 weeks after the bone marrow (BM) evaluation by assessing the stability of improved counts on peripheral blood (PB) according to the 2006 IWG criteria; an additional marrow confirmatory specimen is not required (applies to all patients in the safety LIC and only MDS patients in the expansion component). Blood counts will be monitored for signs of hematologic improvement (HI) (applies to all patients in the safety LIC and only MDS patients in the expansion component). Transfusional support (packed red blood cells and platelets) will also be recorded. Timely and complete disease assessments (BM evaluation and peripheral blood (PB) counts) at screening and during the study, whenever clinically indicated, are essential. Failure to perform any of the required disease assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status for that time point and may weaken the study conclusions. Safety assessments (laboratory, instrumental and clinical) and PK assessments will be performed regularly during the active treatment period in both components of the study. DDI assessments were performed in the safety LIC component of the study. PROs of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) will be assessed in the expansion component of the study. Please refer to the Schedule of Activities for the Safety Lead-in and the Schedule of Activities for the Expansion: MDS and AML Patients for a complete list of assessments to be performed on patients in the study. STUDY TREATMENTS Treatment will be administered in 28-day cycles. Glasdegib will be administered at the starting dose of 100 mg QD given orally and continuously in combination with azacitidine. Safety Lead-in Cohort The safety lead-in cohort has been completed.  All patients will be administered glasdegib 100 mg QD orally and continuously.  Azacitidine will be administered SC at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day on a continuous schedule from Day 1 to Day 7 of each cycle. Expansion  All patients will be administered glasdegib, 100 mg QD orally and continuously.  Azacitidine will be administered per local label or per the Investigational Product Manual (or SPC). Azacitidine may be administered by SC injection or IV infusion at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days every 28 days. Alternate dosing schedules to administer the 7 doses to accommodate patient and treatment center availability are allowed. Since responses to azacitidine may require 4-6 cycles of administration to emerge, treatment with the study drug combination should be continued for at least 6 cycles, or until unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal, or death, whichever occurs first. If documentation of disease progression occurs within the first 6 cycles of study treatment, the patient SHOULD NOT be withdrawn from study treatment if, in the Investigator’s judgment, the patient is still likely to receive clinical benefit. Treatment with the study drug combination should be continued beyond 6 cycles of treatment until objective disease progression or relapse, unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal, or death, whichever occurs first. Treatment should also be continued beyond 6 cycles if patients demonstrate reasonable evidence of clinical benefit, defined as HI or better in patients enrolled into the safety LIC. During the expansion component, clinical benefit will be defined as SD + HI or better in MDS patients, and not meeting the criteria for disease progression for AML patients. If glasdegib is permanently discontinued for reasons other than objective disease progression, patient refusal, or consent withdrawal, single-agent treatment with azacitidine may be continued if, in the Investigator’s judgment, a clinical benefit has been observed and following discussion between the Investigator and Sponsor. In cases of unacceptable toxicity or pregnancy, the patient must be withdrawn from study drug combination and entered into the follow-up phase of the study. When study treatment with both drugs (azacitidine and glasdegib) is permanently discontinued, all patients will enter into the follow-up phase. STATISTICAL METHODS Approximately 10 patients will be included in the LIC. This sample size provides at least 80% probability to observe at least one adverse event (AE) if the true incidence of the AE in the population is at least 15%. In the expansion phase of the study, two cohorts of patients (MDS and AML respectively) approximately 30 patients each will be enrolled. Based on Bayesian decision rule, we will need 10 to 30 patients for each cohort. For the MDS cohort, with 30 patients the maximum width of the exact 2-sided 95% confidence interval for CR will be ≤0.374. For the AML cohort, with a maximum of 30 patients the maximum width of the exact 2-sided 95% CI for    Footnote for Schedule of Activities 1.

Treatment can be administered as a SC injection or IV infusion on Days 1-7 (3 days). Visit time window added to accommodate varying azacitidine dosing schedules to accommodate patient and treatment center availability. The start of subsequent cycles can be delayed to allow for toxicity resolution. 15. Drug Compliance: All glasdegib bottles including any unused tablets and patient dosing diaries will be returned to the clinic for compliance assessment and drug accountability. 16. Bone Marrow Assessments for Disease Evaluation.  Type of Bone Marrow Sample: For all patients, a bone marrow aspirate sample is required at every disease evaluation, and will be used for both local clinical staging and centralized biomarker assessments. Bone marrow biopsies are optional unless required for clinical staging (eg, dry tap). Samples taken prior to consent but within the 28-day window may be used for disease evaluation and need not be repeated. Bone marrow samples required for other study assessments (eg, MRD assessment) must be collected after consent is signed. We recommend, but do not require, patients sign an informed consent prior to a diagnostic bone marrow aspiration to avoid an additional procedure to collect bone marrow aspirate for the biomarker assessments required during screening  Timepoints for Bone Marrow Sampling: Bone marrow assessment must be completed at screening (within 28 days prior to first dose), C7D1 (-3/+14 days) (unless done earlier due to suspected CR), C13D1 and every 12 cycles thereafter (C25D1, C37D1, C49D1, etc), and at any time as per investigators discretion if CR is suspected. No bone marrow assessment is necessary if non-response or progressive disease can be diagnosed from peripheral blood evaluation or radiological/clinical assessment. 17. Bone Marrow Genetics: Genetics analysis (local), including karyotyping, will be conducted on all patients using any scheduled or unscheduled bone marrow samples collected during study participation. Genetics to be analyzed are specified in Appendix 3 for MDS patients and Appendix 16 for AML patients. Baseline genetics classification must be completed on a sample collected within 28 days prior to first dose. 18. Adverse Event (AE)/Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Monitoring: Adverse events should be documented and recorded at each visit using the NCI CTCAE version 4.03. Recording of AEs/SAEs on the CRF commences with informed consent. Patients must be followed for AEs for 28 days after the last treatment administration or until all drug related toxicities have resolved, whichever is later; or earlier than 28 days should the patient commence another anticancer therapy in the meantime. For serious adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, (ie, prior to undergoing any study related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product, even if another anticancer therapy has been started. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug are to be reported to the sponsor. 19. Concomitant Medications and Treatments: All concomitant medications and treatments should be recorded in the CRF. 20. Red Blood Cells and Platelets Transfusion Recording: Transfusion history up to 8 weeks prior to screening should be recorded. All red blood cell and platelet transfusions, including date of each transfusion and number of red blood cell and platelet units transfused will be recorded while on treatment. Note that number of units not number of bags must be recorded.  Table 4. Pharmacokinetics & ECG Schedule for the Expansion: MDS and AML Patients 13 1. Glasdegib PK Sample Collection: In all instances, “0 hour” represents a pre-dose collection. The PK sample should be collected within 30 minutes prior to dose administration. All post-dose samples are to be collected within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6 minutes of a 60 minute sample). Patients should be reminded not to take their study drug prior to arriving at the clinic on protocol scheduled visits. All PK timepoints are in reference to dosing of glasdegib. 2. Triplicate 12-Lead ECGs: At each time point, 3 consecutive supine 12-lead ECGs will be performed approximately 2 minutes apart to determine mean QTc interval. ECGs will be collected: prior to blood sample collection, such that the blood sample is collected at the appropriate time. All ECG timepoints are in reference to dosing of glasdegib). A 15 min window for each ECG collection is allowed around the nominal ECG time point. 3. PK samples to be collected only on Cycle 2 Day 1.

INTRODUCTION Glasdegib (PF-04449913) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of the Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) pathway which is currently under development for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. This multi-center open-label Phase 1b study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of glasdegib when combined with azacitidine in patients with previously untreated Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML). This Phase 1b study includes two components: (a) a safety lead-in cohort (LIC) and (b) an expansion phase with two cohorts. 1.1. Indication Safety Lead-In Cohort Previously untreated adult patients with Intermediate-2 or High-Risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), AML with 20%-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, (according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification), and CMML. Expansion  Previously untreated adult patients with Intermediate, High, or Very High risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R), and  AML patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (according to WHO 2016 classification). 1.2. Background and Rationale 1.2.1. Disease Overview MDS is comprised of a heterogeneous group of myeloid disorders defined by a set of common features, of which the most prominent is morphologic bone marrow and peripheral blood dysplasia associated with inefficient hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias, and increased risk of transformation to AML. The incidence of MDS was previously estimated to be around 4–5 per 100,000 annually worldwide, with the prevalence increasing with age.1 An older publication based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)–Medicare database, indicated that in the US the incidence of MDS in individuals aged ≥65 years might be as high as 75 per 100,000.2 A recent analysis published in 2015 estimates the true incidence of MDS to be between 5.3 and 13.1 per 100,000 using newer case capture methods. Medicare claims data in the US shows the incidence of MDS in patients aged ≥65 years to now be as high as 162 per 100,000. MDS prevalence is estimated to be 60,000 and –170,000 in the United States of America (USA) and projected to increase (Cogle et al, 2015).50 Genetic and functional studies have demonstrated that MDS results from the acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations leading to abnormal differentiation and dysregulated self-renewal. Recent data indicate that cytogenetic patterns are not stable in MDS, and that as the disease progresses a significant fraction of patients acquire additional cytogenetic changes. This phenomenon is associated with an increased risk of transformation to AML and a worse overall survival.3 The French-American-British (FAB) 1982 classification system provided the first approach allowing a reliable diagnosis of the MDS group of diseases, previously termed pre-leukemia.4 In 20015 and subsequently in an updated version in 2008,6 a group of clinicians, pathologists and cytogeneticists formulated the WHO classification of hematopoietic neoplasms. The principal modifications with respect to the FAB classification were to consider patients with 20% or more bone marrow or peripheral blood blasts as having AML, and to remove the CMML subtype and place it into a newly created category termed Myelodysplastic/ Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MDS/MPN). The WHO 2008 version was used to classify patients in the safety LIC component of the current study. The WHO classification was recently updated again in 2016, providing more evidence on the impact of genetic markers on diagnosis and disease management and will be used to classify the MDS patients in the expansion component of the current study (Arber et al, 2016).51 Independent of the classification system applied, MDS prognosis is established by assessing key features that include: morphology, percentage blasts, cytopenias and cytogenetic characteristics. According to the 4 category International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), the higher-risk MDS group (Intermediate-2 and High-Risk) is characterized by a median overall survival of less than 12 months and by a high risk of transformation to AML.8 The IPSS has been updated to the International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised (IPSS-R) via incorporation of additional elements of cytogenetics and further prognostication into 5 categories (Greenberg et al, 2012).43 Patients enrolled into the safety LIC of the study were assessed using IPSS and patients enrolled into the expansion component of the study will be assessed using the more contemporary IPSS-R (Appendix 10). The inclusion of the IPSS-R risk of intermediate, high, or very high, has a concordance greater than 80% with the old IPSS scoring system.43 AML is a genetically heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterized by increased blast counts, pancytopenias causing infections and bleeding, multiple mutations and epigenetic dysregulation at the time of diagnosis that evolves with treatment, resulting in treatment resistance, disease relapse, and reduced survival. Elderly AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy present with many more comorbidities, a greater number of chromosomal abnormalities, and higher incidence of prior hematologic diseases as compared to AML patients able to receive intensive chemotherapy resulting in fewer treatment options, lower remission rates and poor survival outcomes. It is estimated that there will be 21,380 new cases and 10,500 deaths from AML in the United States in 2017.44 There are two staging systems commonly used for AML. The original FAB 1976 system provided the first approach at the morphologic classification of acute leukemias to define specific immunotypes, which has since been revised several times. The newer WHO 2008 classification system looked at chromosome translocations and evidence of dysplasia. In 2016, the WHO classification system was revised, providing more evidence on the impact of genetic markers on diagnosis and disease management and will be used to classify the AML patients in the expansion component of the current study (Arber et al, 2016).51 AML is a disease with large differences in prognosis, age and cytogenetic abnormalities constituting the strongest prognostic factors for OS (Röllig et al, 2011).52 In 2011, the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) proposed a risk reporting system that integrated molecular and cytogenetic factors, dividing AML patients into 4 risk categories (favourable, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, adverse), demonstrating that these groups varied in terms of median survival times. Historical median OS for patients 60 years who did not receive an allogeneic stem-cell transplant by risk group are as follows: favorable (63.6 months), intermediate-1 (13.6 months), intermediate-2 (18.7 months), and adverse (6.0 months) (Röllig et al, 2011).52 Historical mOS for patients >60 years by risk group are as follows: favorable (14.6 months), intermediate-1 (9.5 months), intermediate-2 (9.2 months), and adverse (4.8 months) (Röllig et al, 2011).52 The ELN system was recently updated in 2017 to include new clinical, prognostic, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic data that emerged over the last 6 years. In the revised system, the intermediate-1 and intermediate-2 risk groups are collapsed into one since they were prognostically indistinguishable in elderly patients, resulting in 3 risk categories (favourable, intermediate, adverse) (Döhner H et al, 2017).42 In addition, the ELN group proposed new response categories (Appendix 11) for AML patients reflective of new data meant to integrate definitions across trials. The AML population proposed in the expansion component of the current study will be categorized by the 2017 ELN system and assessed by the updated response categories. 1.2.2. Hedgehog (Hh) Pathway Signaling in MDS A milestone in perceiving cancer as a disorder of differentiation and development was the identification of cancer stem cells that self-renew, initiate, and re-initiate tumor development and give rise to the bulk of the tumor. The persistence of such tumor-initiating cells may contribute to tumor resistance and impact overall survival. Standard chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies reduce tumor bulk, but are less effective at targeting tumor-initiating cells. The key challenge has been to identify the molecular mechanisms maintaining and sustaining tumor-initiating cell activity, self-renewal and survival. Hh signaling is critical in animal patterning and terminal cell differentiation during embryogenesis, and may play a key role in human malignancies when aberrantly activated. Following birth, the Hh pathway is repressed in most cells, but activated during tissue repair and in self-renewing populations. Hh signaling is initiated when the Hh ligands: Indian Hh (Ihh), Sonic Hh (Shh), and/or Desert Hh (Dhh) bind to the Patched (PTCH) transmembrane protein and inactivate its function, which in the absence of Hh is to tonically inhibit SMO ligands, the seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO), which is normally held in an inactive state by PTCH, is released and activates a signaling cascade that regulates the Gli family of transcription factors (Figure 2). The Gli family of genes encode proteins that function either as transcriptional repressors (in the absence of Hh), or as transcriptional activators (in the presence of Hh) of genes controlled by the Hh pathway. Several proteins modulate the ratio of Gli activator (GliA) to Gli repressor (GliR) activity and in so doing determine the level of active cellular Hh ligand (Figure 2).9 Since its initial description, the Hh pathway has received increasing attention as a pleiotropic oncogenic pathway, and its aberrant activity has been implicated in both hematopoietic and solid tumor malignancies through a range of different mechanisms, including a direct cell cycle and anti-angiogenic effect.10,11 Given that these cell types and mechanisms are unrelated in developmental origin, site, and function, a common dependence of tumor-initiating cells on Hh-Gli signaling for survival and self-renewal, paralleling its roles in normal development and homeostasis, may underlie its involvement in human cancers.12 An important caveat, is that the Hh signaling pathway is dispensable for adult hematopoietic stem cell function.13 Figure 2. Hh Signaling Pathway The expression of Hh-related genes has been assessed in primary human CD34+ cells, CD34+ blastic cells (from MDS and AML patients) and BM stromal cells. Both Ihh and its signal transducer SMO, were expressed in CD34+ AML and MDS-derived cells. Moreover the expression of the intrinsic Hh-signaling inhibitor, human Hh-interacting protein (HHIP) was markedly lower in AML/MDS-derived stromal cells as compared with healthy donor-derived AviMa dLe/mMeDthSy-ldaetiroivne odf s HtrHomIPa lg ceenlels a.1n4d Trehdeusec edda ttah ed elemuoknemstriact cee tlhl-es ureplpeovratnincge oafc tHivhit syi gonf aling in primary CD34+ blasts derived from AML and MDS and confirm its involvement in shaping the BM microenvironment during the development of myeloid malignancies. Furthermore, over-expression of the Hh signaling target gene BMI1 was detected in MDS patients, and inversely correlated with the apoptosis of CD34+ cells. In addition, over-expression of BMI1 was correlated with an elevated IPSS score and a shorter overall survival in MDS patients, facilitated proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis of MDS cells in vitro. This suggests that over-expression of BMI1, a target of the Hh signaling pathway, induces resistance to apoptosis and confers an adverse prognosis in MDS.15 Finally, the role of the Hh signaling pathway was investigated in total BM and in CD34+ cells from MDS patients and healthy donors. PTCH and SMO showed decreased expression in MDS CD34+ cells, whereas GLI1 overexpression was observed, indicating pathway activation in MDS progenitors.16 In nonclinical AML models, SMO, acting via its effector GLI2, has been implicated in the maintenance of LSC dormancy and associated resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy, while inhibition of SMO via glasdegib can cause LSCs to re-enter the cell cycle (Sadarangani, 2015; Tauchi, 2015; Fukushima, 2016).54,55,53 Recrudescence of LSCs is prevented in preclinical hosts pre-treated with Hh pathway inhibitors, including glasdegib (Fukushima et al, 2016). Consistent with these effects, glasdegib sensitized AML cells to cytosine arabinoside, and abrogated resistance to cytosine arabinoside in AML cells co-cultured with stromal cells (Fukushima, 2016).53 In a preclinical MDS model, blocking the Hh pathway with SMO inhibitors in combination with the hypomethylating agent (HMA) azacitidine (Aza) generated synergy in vitro with growth inhibition in primary malignant myeloid cells ex vivo (Tibes, 2015).56 Hh inhibition in combination with HMAs represents a mechanistically attractive approach for the elimination of the LSC population, while at the same time targets the deregulated gene expression in patients with higher-risk MDS. Taken together these results suggest that the Hh signaling pathway is frequently aberrantly activated in MDS patients and its inhibition represents an attractive therapeutic approach to improve disease control. 1.2.3. Rationale for Glasdegib/Azacitidine Combination Therapy in Patients with Higher-Risk MDS, AML, and CMML Treatment of higher risk (Intermediate-2 and High-Risk) MDS and AML with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, has typically been based on intensive chemotherapy using anthracycline and cytarabine (Ara-C) combinations. This has resulted in lower CR rates and shorter CR duration with respect to that observed in primary AML.2,17 In response to this unmet medical need, several multicenter randomized studies have compared treatment with a HMA treatment to supportive care in MDS patients, including the D-0007 (decitabine), AZA-001 (azacitidine), CALGB-9221 (azacitidine), and EORTC-06011 (decitabine) trials. These trials have demonstrated delayed progression to AML following HMA therapy, with an improvement in median PFS over supportive care ranging from 3 to 8 months.18-21 Indeed, MDS is characterized by frequent epigenetic abnormalities, including the hypermethylation of genes that control proliferation, adhesion, and other characteristic features of this pre- leukemic status. Aberrant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hypermethylation is associated with a poor prognosis in MDS that can be accounted for by a more rapid progression to AML.39 Azacitidine was approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004 for the treatment of all MDS subtypes according to the FAB classification. Effectiveness was demonstrated in a randomized trial comparing azacitidine with best supportive care (BSC) and in two single-arm studies. The overall response rate (complete response + partial response) observed in the randomized study CALGB-9221 was 15.7% in the azacitidine treatment arm and there were no responders in the control arm (P <0.0001). The median duration of overall survival did not significantly differ between patients receiving azacitidine and those receiving supportive care, although the results were confounded by 49 best supportive care patients (53%) that crossed over to azacitidine during the course of the trial. In a landmark analysis designed to eliminate this confounding effect, the median duration of overall survival was significantly longer in patients initially randomized to azacitidine as compared with those initially randomized to supportive care who did not cross over to azacitidine or who crossed over after 6 months had elapsed (18 versus 11 months; p = 0.03).21 Results published in 2009 from the international AZA-001 phase 3 randomized trial comparing azacitidine to conventional care regimens (CCR), including BSC, low dose cytarabine (LDAC) and intensive chemotherapy, in 358 intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS patients presented additional data to suggest an overall survival benefit. Despite a low CR rate (17%), azacitidine treatment significantly prolonged OS with respect to CCR. Median OS was 24.5 months (9.9–not reached) for the azacitidine arm versus 15.0 months (5.6–24.1) for the CCR arm (hazard ratio 0.58; 95% CI 0.43–0.77). A significantly lower risk of progression to AML (HR=0.50, 95% CI 0.35–0.70; p<0.0001) was also observed with azacitidine as compared with CCR, and transfusion independence was achieved more frequently in the azacitidine arm.18 Based on the results of this trial, azacitidine was approved in European Union for the treatment of adults who are not eligible for HSCT and have Intermediate-2 or High-Risk MDS, CMML with 10-29% marrow blasts without myeloproliferative component, and AML with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, (according to the WHO 2008). An important observation from the AZA-001 study was that the achievement of CR is not a prerequisite for increased OS. Indeed, the results of this trial demonstrated that patients who achieved hematologic improvement (HI) (based on the International Working Group (IWG) 2000 criteria for MDS) but never attained complete or partial response still obtained a survival benefit.18 Azacitidine has become the standard of care in front line higher risk MDS and AML patients with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, although it is not curative. Continued treatment with azacitidine is necessary in order to maintain clinical responses and following failure of the azacitidine treatment, life expectancy among MDS patients is short with a median survival of less than 6 months.22 As a result of these limitations, combination treatments of investigational agents with an HMA as a backbone are currently under investigation.23 AML is a genetically heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterized by multiple mutations and epigenetic dysregulation at the time of diagnosis that evolves with treatment, resulting in treatment resistance, disease relapse, and reduced survival. In 2015, results from the international randomized phase 3 AZA-AML trial comparing azacitidine to CCRs in patients aged ≥ 65 years with newly diagnosed or secondary AML with >30% bone marrow blasts demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in mOS in the azacitidine arm of 10.4 months (95% CI, 8.0-12.7) vs 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.6) in the CCR arm (HR=0.85; 95% CI, 0.69-1.03; stratified log-rank p=0.1009), although the primary endpoint was not met. The CR rate in the azacitidine arm was lower than the CCR arm (19.5% vs 21.9%). The 1-year survival rate with azacitidine was 46.5% compared with 34.2% with conventional therapy (95% CI, 3.5%-21.0%; Dombret et al, 2015).57 Based on the observed survival benefit, the EU expanded the approval of azacitidine in AML to adult patients aged 65 years or older who are not eligible for HSCT with >30% myeloblasts according to the WHO classification; previously, the indication covered AML patients with <30% blasts. Despite the modest increase in mOS and low CR rate, azacitidine is the currently the standard of care for AML patients not suitable for intensive chemotherapy. New treatments are needed to improve outcomes in this older AML population. Preliminary efficacy data from the safety LIC of the current study which enrolled patients with high risk MDS per IPSS, AML with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, and CMML, treated with glasdegib 100 mg PO Qday in combination with azacitidine, showed 5 patients responded: 3 patients with CR, 2 patients with marrow mCR. Of note, after the data cutoff date, the complete blood count of 1 of the patients with mCR had normalized, consistent with CR. Of the 5 patients who responded, 4 responses occurred on or before Day 100. Of the 4 patients with CR (including the mCR patient who achieved a CR after the data cutoff date), 3 patients had AML (75% CR rate vs the historical control for azacitidine alone, 19.5%) and 1 patient had MDS (14% CR rate vs the historical control for azacitidine alone, 17%). A further 4 patients had SD. No evidence of drug-drug interaction (DDI) was noted. As of September 2016, mOS had not been reached. In the Phase 1b part of Study B1371003, 52 patients with previously untreated AML or higher risk MDS were treated with glasdegib decitabine (n=7), or 7 + 3 (n=22). Of the AML patients treated in combination with decitabine, 2/5 (40%) responded (1 CR and 1 complete response with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi]). Of the high-risk MDS patients treated in combination with decitabine, 2/2 responded (2 mCR). Median OS in the combined AML and MDS patients were 4.4 months, 11.5 months (vs historical mOS of 7.7 months with decitabine alone), and 34.7 months respectively in the 3 treatment arms. A similar population of newly diagnosed elderly AML patients was enrolled into a Phase 3 study of decitabine vs supportive care vs LDAC where the CR+ CRi rate was 25.6% in the decitabine only arm. In the Phase 2 portion of Study B1371003, a prospective, randomized (2:1), open-label clinical trial in 132 previously untreated AML patients not suitable for intensive chemotherapy based on age or other risk factors and higher risk MDS, the addition of glasdegib 100 mg orally PO Qday to LDAC vs LDAC alone resulted in a significant improvement in OS (mOS 8.8 months (80% CI: 6.9, 9.9) vs 4.9 months (80% CI: 3.5, 6.0); hazard ratio [HR] 0.513 [80 % CI: 0.394-0.666]; 1-sided p-value=0.0004). In addition, the CR/CRi rate for AML patients in the glasdegib + LDAC arm was higher than the LDAC alone arm (25% [80% CI: 19.1, 30.9] vs 4.5% [80% CI: 0.5, 8.6]). When glasdegib was combined with treatments commonly used in patients with higher risk MDS and AML not suitable for intensive chemotherapy (azacitidine, decitabine, and LDAC), improvements in response rates and OS in the context of historical controls were observed. The target population in the safety LIC for this study was aligned with the AZA 001 trial, which addressed changes in the FAB and WHO 2008 MDS classifications systems. The population included Intermediate-2 and High-Risk MDS according to IPSS, AML 20-30% BM blasts and with multi-lineage dysplasia, (WHO 2008) considered smoldering leukemias that may remain stable for weeks or months, somewhat MDS-like, and therefore not necessarily benefiting from the intensive treatments used for classic AML patients, and lastly CMML patients without a myeloproliferative component (MDS type), defined as white blood cells (WBC) 13 x 109/L according to the FAB classification. All three hematological malignancies described above have been shown to benefit from azacitidine treatment. In the expansion component of this study, patients with Intermediate, High, or Very High risk MDS according to IPSS-R and AML patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (WHO 2016) will be enrolled. CMML patients and patients with unclassifiable MDS/MPN are eligible for enrollment into the MDS cohort. Based on the results of the AZA-AML trial, the azacitidine label was expanded in 2009, making azacitidine a standard of care treatment in elderly AML patients unable to tolerate intensive therapies. This historical data, coupled with the preliminary efficacy data from the safety LIC of the current study warrants further investigation of azacitidine’s benefit in a larger AML population. Since several prognostic and classification systems were recently updated, the following will be implemented in the expansion component of the study to make it more contemporary: IPSS-R and the WHO 2016 classification system will be applied to the MDS patients and the updated 2017 ELN risk stratification and updated response categories and the revised WHO 2016 classification system will be applied to the AML patients. Given the central role that Hh signaling plays in cellular differentiation through modulating both the leukemia stem cells (LSC) population and the surrounding stromal environment, Hh inhibition in combination with HMAs represents a mechanistically attractive approach for the elimination of the LSC population while targeting the gene expression deregulation involved in the pathway development in patients with Higher-Risk MDS, AML, and CMML. 1.2.4. Summary of Glasdegib Product Profile Glasdegib is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Hh signaling pathway through binding to its target SMO. It is currently being developed for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Complete information for glasdegib may be found in the single reference study document (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator Brochure (IB).26 Glasdegib inhibited the binding of a known comparator inhibitor of SMO (PF-03451358) with an half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC ) of 4 nM. In addition, in a Shh-induced 50 Gli-Luciferase reporter assay, glasdegib inhibited the Hh pathway activity with an IC of 50 3 nM. Using human aortic adventitial fibroblasts, Shh stimulation for 48 hours induced a 300% increase in endogenous Gli1 levels, assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR); glasdegib at 100 nM inhibited 75% of the ligand-induced Gli1 levels. Glasdegib was also evaluated in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, a cell line that forms triglycerides through a mechanism activated by insulin and antagonized by Shh. In this model, glasdegib (50 nM) reproducibly antagonized Shh, restoring 60% of lipid production relative to control cultures induced with insulin alone.26 In the PTCH/P53 medulloblastoma mouse model of Hh pathway-driven tumors, glasdegib inhibited pathway activation (Gli1 expression) and produced rapid and complete tumor regression. Preclinical PK/PD modeling using this model suggests a target human dose of 15 mg/day is projected to yield at least 50% of tumor Gli1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) inhibition from baseline levels and approximately 20% of skin Gli1 mRNA suppression.26 A series of preclinical studies show that glasdegib has significant activity in imatinib resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis disease (Abrahamsson-Schairer A. et al).38 Patient derived CD34+ imatinib resistant blast crisis CML cells xenotransplanted into immunocompromised mice treated with glasdegib alone or in combination with dasatinib reduced primary leukemic tumor burden. In addition, glasdegib treatment reduced leukemic tumor formation in secondary recipients, suggesting that glasdegib is able to inhibit the LSC population necessary for tumor propagation. Importantly, this was verified in CML T315I mutants, which have escaped tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) inhibition. 1.2.5. Glasdegib Preclinical Toxicity Data Glasdegib has been extensively characterized in nonclinical safety studies in rats, dogs and rabbits. Glasdegib was evaluated in safety pharmacology studies (cardiovascular, neurofunctional, respiratory), definitive toxicology assessments of up to 6- and 9-months duration, in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies, local irritation study and embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies. The primary target organs in rat included kidney, bone, and tooth. Additional findings were observed in rat testis and peripheral nerve, and clinical observations included alopecia and muscle tremor/twitching. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) determined from the 6 month Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) rat study was 10 mg/kg/day, corresponding to free plasma concentrations of 116 ng/mL (C ) and max 36 ng/mL (C ). The primary target organs in the dog included kidney and liver. avgss Additional observations of alopecia and skin irritation/inflammation, and QTc prolongation were identified in the dog. A NOAEL from the 9-month GLP dog study was not established. At the lowest dose tested in this study, 1 mg/kg/day, the free plasma concentrations were 16 ng/mL (C ) and 2 ng/mL (C ). Glasdegib was teratogenic at all doses tested in rats max avgss and rabbits. 1.2.5.1. Kidney Effects in Preclinical Studies The kidney was identified as a target organ in both rat and dog toxicity studies. Adverse kidney damage (tubular degeneration/necrosis, cytomegaly, inflammation, regeneration) was observed in rats at ≥50 mg/kg/day and dogs at ≥1 mg/kg/day and was ascribed as the primary cause of unscheduled euthanasia in both species. Kidney damage partially reversed in rats and fully reversed in dogs during the recovery phase in both the GLP 6-month rat and 9-month dog studies. 1.2.6. Bone Effects in Preclinical Studies Bone (epiphysis) and tooth (incisor) effects were observed in rat GLP studies with glasdegib. Bone changes in the femur and sternum were characterized by decreased/disorganized chondrocytes and partial to complete closure of epiphysis. The odontopathy were characterized by incisor tooth necrosis and/or complete loss of the tooth and in some animals was coincident with oral mucosal ulceration and inflammation. The effects on bone and teeth persisted during recovery phases and did not reverse. The changes in the epiphyseal growth plate are consistent with inhibiting the hedgehog (Hh) pathway in growing bone (Kimura et al, 2008)24 and chondrogenesis (Amano et al, 2008)25 and the generation of ameloblast progenitors from stem cells in the continuously growing rodent incisor (Seidel et al, 2010; Dassule et al, 2000)61,62 is dependent on Hh pathway activity. 1.2.7. Cardiovascular Effects in Preclinical Studies The potential for QT prolongation was identified from the in vitro human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay and in vivo cardiovascular dog study. Glasdegib produced dose related changes in the QTc interval. At 5 mg/kg, a small (5 msec) but statistically significant increase in QTc interval occurred at free plasma exposures of 420 ng/mL (C ). At 30 mg/kg, a statistically significant increase in QTc interval (24 msec) max occurred at free plasma exposures of 1848 ng/mL (C ). The QTc prolongation observed in max the dog is consistent with the hERG IC for glasdegib (3.1 uM). 50 1.2.8. Embryo-fetal Effects in Nonclinical Studies Teratogenicity was identified in rat and rabbit embryo fetal developmental toxicity studies. Glasdegib treatment was associated with increased spontaneous abortions, lower embryo-fetal survival, higher incidence of skeletal anomalies, lower fetal body weights, and developmental NOAEL could not be established in rat or rabbit due to adverse teratogenic effects at all doses. Inhibition of Hh signaling has been shown to induce teratogenicity in animals as SMO is involved in embryonic development. Accordingly, inhibition of Hh signaling by small molecules can lead to teratogenic effects (Chen et al, 2002, Cooper et al, 1998).63,64 1.2.9. Other Findings in Preclinical Studies Additional glasdegib-related findings in rats were observed in testis and peripheral nerve, and clinical observations included alopecia and muscle tremor/twitching. Microscopic changes in the nerve and clinical observations of alopecia and muscle tremors fully recovered. Testicular degeneration did not recover; however this finding was only seen in young growing rats and not in adult dogs and is consistent with inhibition of Hh signaling which plays a role in postnatal testis spermatogenesis (Mäkelä et al, 2011).65 In dog toxicity studies with glasdegib, mild liver inflammation with increased liver enzymes was observed in some dogs. However, this finding was only evidenced in dogs with adverse renal damage and is likely secondary to kidney findings. The liver findings partially recovered. Glasdegib was not genotoxic in any in vitro or in vivo assessment, did not cause local irritation when administered intravenously or perivascularly to rabbits and did not cause photo-irritancy in the eye or skin. 1.2.10. Clinical Relevance of Organ Toxicities Observed in Nonclinical studies In general, many findings in the rat and dog predict drug reactions reported in the clinic with glasdegib; these include muscle spasms, alopecia and QTc prolongation. However; not all of the organ toxicities observed in animals have been observed in humans when treated with glasdegib. Although mild axonal degeneration was observed in rat mesenteric peripheral nerve, there have been no reported clinical effects related to worsening or new onset of peripheral nerve deficits. The kidney is a target organ in rat and dog. In the clinical program, at glasdegib, 100 mg dose, acute kidney injury has been reported, primarily Grade 1-2. These events were often associated with prerenal confounders or consequent to or exacerbated by other glasdegib effects (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, and/or decreased oral intake). An imbalance in creatinine elevations was not seen in the AML unfit LDAC + glasdegib arm versus the LDAC arm alone. There have not been any liver events or significant increases in liver transaminases reported in the clinic. Findings in bone, teeth and testis are considered only a potential concern for pediatric patients as Hh signaling is important in growth and development of these tissues as cited above, thus, these effects have not manifest in adult patients and are not a risk for adults being treated with glasdegib. 1.2.11. Clinical Pharmacokinetic Summary Data following single and multiple doses of glasdegib from Study B1371001 in patients with selected hematologic malignancies are summarized for all cohorts tested (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 180, 270, 400, and 600 mg QD). The exposure [Cmax, AUCinf (single dose) and AUCtau (multiple dose)] increased in a generally dose-proportional manner over the dose range of 5 to 600 mg following glasdegib administration on the lead-in day and Cycle 1 Day 21. Following repeated daily dosing, steady-state was achieved by Day 8 based on comparison of C values across PK days in Cycle 1. Median T of glasdegib ranged from 1-2 hours trough max following a single dose and 1-4 hours following multiple dosing. The mean glasdegib volume of distribution (V /F) ranged from 185-455 L. The geometric z % coefficient of variance (CV) for AUC across all dose levels ranged from 19% to inf 109% following a single dose (safety LIC) and from 10% to 61% for AUC after multiple tau dosing (Day 21). Similarly, the geometric % CV for C ranged from 3.0% to 79% after a max single dose and 7.0% to 83% following multiple dosing. The geometric mean t for glasdegib ranged from 17.4 to 34.3 hours across the various dose ½ levels; however, at most dose levels, the half-life was ~24 hours. The geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) ranged from 5.63 to 12.7 L/hour following a single dose and 5.33 to 13.3 L/hour following multiple dosing. Glasdegib accumulated following repeated dosing with a median R ranging from 1.2 to 2.5. This was consistent with the observed t , ac ½ as the predicted R is in agreement with the estimated R . The median linearity ratio (R ) ac ac ss ranged from 0.76 to 2.1, with the ratio being close to unity for most of the tested dose levels. The geometric mean for the percentage of administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine over the dosing interval of 24 hours ranged from 5.89% to 16.8%. The geometric mean for renal clearance ranged from 0.385 L/hr to 1.36 L/hr. 1.2.12. Clinical Pharmacodynamic Summary Analysis of Hh pathway gene expression changes in surrogate tissue (skin) in samples collected from both the B1371001 (n=3) and B1371002 (n=15) studies indicated >75% down regulation of the expression of the Hh pathway gene GLI1 at doses of 80 mg or higher in all patients with evaluable samples. Evaluation of circulating cytokine modulation demonstrated a post-treatment decrease in IL-8 and IL-10 in one MF patient who responded to treatment in B1371001, although limited conclusions can be drawn due to the small number of samples available for analysis. 1.2.13. Clinical Experience in Patients with Selected Myeloid Malignancies Currently there are five clinical studies with glasdegib in patients with hematological malignancies (B1371001, B1371003, B1371005, B1371013, and Investigator Initiated Research (IIR) Studies (WS2233096 and WI171861). Study B1371001 was a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, escalating dose Phase 1 study in patients with select advanced hematologic malignancies. Study B1371003 (ongoing) is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter safety and efficacy study of glasdegib in combination with low-dose cytarabine (Ara-C), decitabine, or intensive chemotherapy, in patients with AML or high risk MDS. Study B1371005 (ongoing) is a Phase 1 dose-finding study of single-agent glasdegib in Japanese patients with select advanced hematologic malignancies, or glasdegib in combination with intensive chemotherapy (cytarabine and daunorubicin) or LDAC in patients with previously untreated AML or high-risk MDS. Study B1371013 (ongoing) is a Phase 2 study of single-agent glasdegib versus placebo in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis who have been previously treated with a Janus kinase inhibitor. An ongoing Phase 2 IIR study at the University of Colorado (WS2233096) is evaluating the effects of glasdegib monotherapy on relapse free survival, remission and OS in patients with AML, MDS, or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) at high risk for relapse post-allogeneic HSCT. Additionally, an ongoing Phase 2 IIR study at the Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (WI171861) is evaluating the glasdegib in patients with MDS. Refer to the glasdegib IB for further details.26 1.2.13.1. Study B1371001: Patients with Select Myeloid Malignancies A total of 47 patients were screened and assigned to treatment in this Phase 1 dose escalation study aimed to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and RP2D of glasdegib in patients with select myeloid malignancies. The dose levels tested in this study were: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 180, 270, 400 and 600 mg QD on a continuous regimen. The majority (28/47 patients, 59.6%) of patients were male. The median age was 69 years (range 25-89 years). The diagnoses of enrolled patients included: AML (28 patients, 59.6%), CML (5 patients, 10.6%), CMML (1 patient, 2.1%), MDS (6 patients, 12.8%), and MF (7 patients, 14.9%). The median duration of treatment with glasdegib was 64.5 days (range: 5-261 days) in AML patients, 36.0 days (range: 1-280 days) in CML patients, 54.0 days (range: 54-54 days) in CMML patients, 153.0 days (range: 36-537 days) in MDS patients, and 182.0 days (range: 44-371 days) in MF patients. Out of the 41 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluable patients, 2 patients experienced DLTs during Cycle 1. One patient in the 80 mg QD cohort experienced non hematologic DLTs of Grade 3 hypoxia and pleural effusion for which glasdegib dosing was interrupted temporarily, and the dose reduced. Additionally one patient in the 600 mg QD cohort experienced a non-hematologic DLT of Grade 3 peripheral edema for which glasdegib was stopped temporarily. The majority of treatment related AEs reported were Grades 1 to 3 in severity. The most frequently reported treatment related AEs were dysgeusia (27.7%), decreased appetite (19.1%) and alopecia (14.9%). A summary of treatment related AEs occurring in >5% of all patients is provided in Table 5 below. Grade 3 laboratory test results independent of causality included: lymphocytes decreased (n=16), platelets decreased (n=8), WBC decreased (n=8), hemoglobin decreased (n=10), neutrophils decreased (n=3), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (n=1), alkaline phosphatase increased (n=2), total bilirubin increased, hypokalemia, hyponatremia (n=4 each), hyperglycemia (n=3), hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia (n=1 each). Grade 4 laboratory test results independent of causality included: platelets decreased (n=33), neutrophils decreased (n=26), WBC decreased (n=15), lymphocytes decreased (n=6), hemoglobin decreased (n=4), bicarbonate increased (n=1). Based on electrocardiogram (ECG) results, 3 patients (1 patient in the 400 mg QD group and 2 patients in the 600 mg QD group) had a post baseline maximum Corrected QT interval using Fridericia Formula (QTcF) of 500 msec, and 6 patients (1 from the 5 mg group and 5 from the 600 mg group) had a maximum QTcF increase from baseline of 60 msec. Higher frequencies and grades of QTcF prolongation were observed at the highest dose levels (400 mg QD and 600 mg QD). All these events were asymptomatic and transient and did not result in significant clinical sequelae. The MTD was defined as 400 mg after considering the one DLT at 600 mg (Grade 3 peripheral edema) and the high frequency of QTc prolongation observed at the 600 mg QD dose level. The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for glasdegib was determined to be 200 mg, based on the following factors:  Doses of glasdegib up to 200 mg were safe and well tolerated following prolonged administration (most patients tolerated study drug for a minimum of 3 cycles in the dose range of 5-180 mg);  At doses >200 mg, 3 patients (1 patient in the 400 mg group and 2 patients in the 600 mg group) had a post baseline maximum QTcF interval of 500 msec;  An overall lower frequency of treatment related Grade 3/4 AEs was observed at doses of 200 mg or less. Over this dose range, the most commonly reported treatment related AEs were of Grade 1 or 2 severity suggesting that glasdegib is generally well tolerated in this dose range. Although evaluation of efficacy was not the primary objective of this study, patients were evaluated for disease specific efficacy endpoints. A total of 4 MDS/CMML patients (4/7 patients: 3/6 MDS patients and 1/1 CMML patient, 57.1%) achieved stable disease or better, among whom 2 patients (2/7 patients, 28.6%) showed hematologic improvement. For the 7 MF patients, 2 patients achieved clinical improvement. For patients with AML (28 patients), 1 patient (3.6%) had morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), 4 patients (14.3%) had partial remission with incomplete blood count recovery (PRI), and 4 patients (14.3%) had minor response (MR). Treatment failures occurred in 7 AML patients (25%) due to resistant disease. Clinical benefit (CR + CRI + PR + PRI + SD + MR) was shown in 16 AML patients (57.1%), including 7 patients (25%) with SD. Out of the 46 patients evaluated for efficacy, 2/7 MDS/CMML patients (28.6%), 2/7 MF patients (28.6%), and 9/28 AML patients (32.1%) had an objective response. In summary, glasdegib appears to be well tolerated with early signs of efficacy observed in all the hematologic diseases studied. Several patients with aggressive malignancies remained on trial for prolonged durations. On target AEs (eg, dysgeusia and alopecia) were observed at multiple dose levels.

Study B1371012: Safety Lead-In Cohort As of 23 September 2015, twelve patients were enrolled into the safety LIC of the current study with higher risk MDS (n=7), AML (n=4), and CMML (n=1) and treated with glasdegib 100mg QD orally in combination with azacitidine 75 mg/m2 SC daily for 7 days. As of a data cutoff date of 19 September 2015, a safety review was conducted in 11/12 patients who received at least 1 cycle of treatment. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 6. One additional patient was enrolled and treated after the data cut-off period (MDS IPSS-risk Intermediate-2). The median glasdegib treatment duration was 51 days, range 23-128 days. The median relative glasdegib dose intensity was 92.0% across all cycles. The median relative Table 6. Baseline Patient Characteristics All patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (n=11) experienced Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs). The most frequently reported TEAEs of any grade and regardless of causality, occurring in 3 or more patients, are summarized in Table 7. Electrocardiogram (EKG) QT prolonged (1 patient Grade 3; 3 patients Grade 1/2). Nine patients (81.8%) experienced ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs. The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs regardless of causality, occurring in 3 or more patients were anemia (72.7%) and neutropenia (45.5%). Table 7. Most Frequently Reported TEAEs in the Safety Lead-In Cohort (Any Grade, All Causality, in  3 Patients) Source: PHASE 1B SAFETY LEAD-IN DATA FOR STUDY B1371012 (Table 14.3.1.2.11.1) Abbreviations: MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, N/n = number of patients, QT = in electrocardiography, the time corresponding to the beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles, TEAE = Treatment Emergent Aderse Events. a. MedDRA (version 18.1) coding dictionary applied. Overall 7 patients (63.6%) experienced SAEs. Of these, the most frequently reported SAEs (reported in 2 patients each, 18.2%) were cellulitis, febrile neutropenia, and pyrexia. As of the data cut-off, 3 patients (27.3%) discontinued study treatment due to the following AEs (n=1 each): grade 4 cellulitis, sepsis, and septic shock not related to either study drug; grade 3 malignant lung neoplasm not related to either study drug; grade 3 QTc prolongation related to glasdegib. One patient died within 28 days of last dose of study medication due to a grade 5 acute myocardial infarction as a result of underlying coronary artery disease and cardiovascular risk factors of obesity and hypertension, deemed unrelated to either study drug by the Investigator. The reported AEs were consistent with the individual toxicity profiles of glasdegib, azacitidine, and complications from the underlying disease itself. The addition of glasdegib to standard of care azacitidine did not appear to adversely impact azacitidine dosing nor did it result in a significant number of discontinuations due to toxicity in the subject population. An internal Pfizer review team declared the combination of glasdegib and azacitidine in the patient population as having an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, consistent with what is expected for glasdegib or azacitidine alone, and deemed acceptable to proceed to the next phase of development. As of 23 March 2016, preliminary data showed a total of 5 patients responded: 3 patients with CR and 2 patients with mCR (of note, after the data cutoff date, the complete blood count of one of the patients with mCR had normalized, consistent with CR). Of the 4 patients with CR (including the mCR patient who became CR after the data cutoff date), 3 patients had oligoblastic AML. Of the 5 patients who responded, 4 responses occurred on or before Day 100. Of the 4 patients with CR (including the mCR patient who achieved a CR after the data cutoff date), 3 patients had AML (75% CR rate vs the historical control for azacitidine alone, 19.5%) and 1 patient had MDS (14% CR rate vs the historical control for azacitidine alone, 17%).18,57 A further 4 patients had stable disease. At the time of the cutoff, median survival had not been reached. An evaluation of the DDI potential between glasdegib and azacitidine was conducted in this component of the study and no evidence of DDI potential was observed. (Borate et al, 2016).45 As of 10 March 2017, the safety LIC is complete with no patients on active treatment, 1 patient in follow-up, 4 patients withdrew from follow up, and 7 patients have died due to the following reasons deemed unrelated to study treatment by the study Investigators: Sepsis leading to Multi-organ failure, Acute myocardial infarction, Unknown (n=1 each), and Disease progression (n=4). No deaths were reported as the reason for discontinuation of study treatment, 2 deaths occurred within 28 days after last treatment dose and, 5 deaths occurred after 28 days from last dose. Based on the acceptable safety and tolerability profile of glasdegib in combination with azacitidine and the early clinical activity seen, further investigation of this combination is warranted. 1.2.13.3. Study B1371003: Phase 1b/2 Study in Patients with AML or High-Risk MDS This is an open-label, multicenter safety and efficacy study of glasdegib in combination with LDAC, decitabine, or intensive chemotherapy in patients with AML or high-risk MDS. This study includes two portions:  Phase 1b: To evaluate the safety and RP2D determination of three first-line combination regimens of glasdegib plus: LDAC, decitabine, or ‘7+3’ induction chemotherapy (cytarabine/daunorubicin).  Phase 2: To assess the efficacy of two combination regimens:  A Phase 2 randomized (2:1) open-label component in unfit patients (P2 Unfit) enrolled to receive either LDAC in combination with glasdegib or LDAC alone;  A Phase 2 single arm component in fit patients (P2 Fit) to receive glasdegib in combination with 7+3 induction chemotherapy. Please refer to the glasdegib IB for further details on this part of the study. Phase 1b Part In the Phase 1b part of Study B1371003, 52 patients with AML or higher risk MDS were treated with glasdegib 100 mg or 200 mg PO Qday in combination with LDAC (n=23), decitabine (n=7), or 7 + 3 (n=22). In Arm A (LDAC + glasdegib), 23 unfit patients were enrolled (15 males/8 females). Seventeen (17) patients received a starting glasdegib dose of 100 mg and 6 patients of 200 mg QD. No DLTs were observed. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in patients were nausea (n = 6, 35.3%), diarrhoea and neutropenia (n = 5, 29.4% each), and muscle spasms and dysgeusia (n = 4, 23.5% each). In Arm B (Decitabine + glasdegib) 7 unfit patients were enrolled (5 male/2 female). Four (4) patients received glasdegib 100 mg and 3 patients received glasdegib 200 mg. No DLTs were reported. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs of any grade were nausea (n=3, 75%), diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia (n=2, 50% each). Of the AML patients treated in combination with decitabine, 2/5 (40%) responded (1 CR and 1 complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)), a similar population of newly diagnosed elderly AML patients was enrolled into a Phase 3 study of decitabine vs supportive care vs low dose cytarabine where the CR+ CRi rate was 25.6% in the decitabine only arm (Kantarjian et al, 2012).58 Of the high-risk MDS patients treated in combination with decitabine, 2/2 achieved a response of mCR. Median OS in the combined AML and MDS patients was 4.4 months, 11.5 months (historical mOS of 7.7 months; Kantarjian et al, 2012),58 and 34.7 months respectively in the 3 treatment arms. This arm was not evaluated in the Phase 2 component of Study B1371003. In Arm C (Cytarabine/Daunorubicin + glasdegib), 22 fit patients were enrolled (12 males/10 females). Sixteen patients received a starting glasdegib dose of 100 mg QD and 6 patients of 200 mg QD. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs in patients who received glasdegib 100 mg + cytarabine + daunorubicin of any grade were nausea (n =13, 81.3%), diarrhea, febrile neutropenia and muscle spasms (n = 7, 43.8% each), dysgeusia (n = 6, 37.5%), stomatitis, headache, fatigue and pyrexia (n = 5, 31.3% each), constipation, dyspepsia, vomiting, anaemia, neutropenia, white blood cell count decreased, hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia and alopecia (n = 4, 25% each). A DLT of Grade 4 polyneuropathy, later attributed to concomitant medication, was reported at the 100 mg dose level and treatment was permanently discontinued in that patient. Of the 45 AML patients treated in the entire Phase 1b cohort of Study B1371003, 1/20 treated patients in combination with LDAC responded (1 CR), 2/5 treated in combination with decitabine responded (1 CR, 1 complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), and 11/20 treated patients in combination with 7 + 3 responded (10 CR, 1 CRi). Median OS (in AML and MDS patients combined) were 4.4 months (80% CI: 2.5, 6.6), 11.5 months (80% CI: 4.5, 17.4), and 34.7 months (80% CI: 14.5, Not Reached), respectively. Of the 7 high-risk MDS patients treated in the entire Phase 1b cohort of Study B1371003, 2/3 treated in combination with LDAC responded (1 CR, 1 mCR), 2/2 treated in combination with decitabine responded (2 mCR), and 2/2 treated in combination with 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy responded (1 CR, 1 mCR). Phase 2 Randomized Combination Part (Phase 2 Unfit) In the Phase 2 portion of Study B1371003, a prospective, randomized (2:1), open-label clinical trial in 132 AML patients not suitable for intensive chemotherapy based on age or other risk factors, the addition of glasdegib 100 mg PO Qday to LDAC vs LDAC alone resulted in a significant improvement in OS (median 8.8 months (80% CI: 6.9, 9.9) vs 4.9 months (80% CI: 3.5, 6.0); HR 0.513 [80% CI: 0.394-0.666]; 1-sided p-value=0.0004 based on stratified log-rank test. This benefit in OS was also consistent within prespecified subgroups and supported by higher rates of complete remission in the LDAC + glasdegib arm (17% [80% CI: 11.9, 22.2] vs 2.3% [80% CI: 0.0, 5.2]). The addition of glasdegib to LDAC was well-tolerated, with 14 (16.7%) discontinuations due to adverse events. Thirteen of 84 (15%) patients were treated for at least 1 year (vs none in the LDAC alone arm). The median treatment duration was 83 days (range 3, 972 days) in the LDAC + glasdegib arm versus 47days (range 6, 239 days) in the LDAC alone arm. The safety profile was consistent with that in elderly AML patients receiving chemotherapy, namely cytopenias and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, and had the safety/tolerability profile of other marketed SMO inhibitors. In the LDAC + glasdegib arm, serious adverse events (SAEs) of febrile neutropenia, occurred more frequently (28.6%) than in the LDAC alone arm (19.5%); however, frequencies of pneumonias were similar between treatment arms (21.4% in the LDAC + glasdegib arm and 17.1% in the LDAC alone arm), and sepsis rates were lower in the LDAC + glasdegib arm (3.6% in the LDAC + glasdegib arm and 12.2% in the LDAC alone arm). The most common AEs in the LDAC + glasdegib arm were cytopenias and GI events, consistent with that in elderly AML patients receiving chemotherapy. Cytopenias were not accompanied with higher rates of infections or bleeding as compared to the LDAC alone arm. QTcF prolongation >500 msec (Grade 3) was less frequent in the LDAC + glasdegib arm (6%) than in the LDAC alone arm (11.8%). SMO inhibitor-associated AEs in the LDAC + glasdegib arm included dysgeusia (25%), muscle spasms (21.4%) and alopecia (10.7%). In the LDAC + glasdegib arm 28 (33%) patients were permanently discontinued due to AEs vs 20 (49%) patients in the LDAC alone arm, mostly for disease progression or infection. The most common cause of death was disease progression in both treatment arms. The safety profile and magnitude of improvement in OS appeared to be consistent with that in other ongoing single-arm studies of glasdegib as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapies in other MDS and AML populations. 1.2.13.4. Study B1371005: Safety and Efficacy in an Asian Population In the ongoing Phase 1 Study B1371005, 25 Japanese patients with selected hematologic malignancies were enrolled into three cohorts: 1) Thirteen (13) patients with AML, MDS, CMML, or MF enrolled into the open label, dose escalation monotherapy cohort and received glasdegib as a single agent at doses ranging from 25-100 mg PO Qday, 2) Six (6) patients with untreated AML or high risk MDS patients unsuitable to receive intensive induction chemotherapy received glasdegib 100 mg PO QD in combination with LDAC , and 3) Six (6) untreated AML or high risk MDS patients eligible for intensive chemotherapy enrolled in combination cohort #2 and received glasdegib 100 mg PO QD in combination No DLTs were observed at any dose level. The most frequently reported treatment related AEs occurring in ≥3 patients were: dysgeusia (69.2%), muscle spasms (38.5%), alopecia (30.8%), and decreased appetite (30.8%), blood creatinine phosphokinase increased (23.1%), constipation (23.1%), and diarrhea (23.1%). The safety and PK profiles in Japanese patients were consistent with what was observed in Western patients and in Study B1371001. Preliminary efficacy data showed that 1 out of 7 AML patients achieved morphologic complete remission and 1 out of 4 MDS patients achieved marrow complete remission at the 100 mg dose level and 4 achieved SD across all dose levels (Yoshimoto et al, 2016).46 1.2.14. Post Allogeneic HSCT Investigator Initiated Research Study In an ongoing IIR, single-arm study in patients with MDS, AML, or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) with evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) or other high-risk characteristics associated with a high rate of disease relapse at the time of allo HSCT, the addition of glasdegib 100 mg PO Qday post absolute neutrophil count (ANC) engraftment for up to a year resulted in 10/13 patients free of disease relapse: 12/13 patients remained alive (Gutman et al, 2015).47 Historically, patients with measureable MRD at the time of HSCT have disease relapse rates >60%, and mOS of ~1 year. (Walter et al, 2015)48 Araki et al, 2016)49 1.2.15. Summary of Azacitidine Product Profile Azacitidine (VIDAZA®) is a chemical analogue of the cytosine nucleoside whose mechanism of action involves inhibition of DNA methyltransferase at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) at high doses, resulting in cell death. Azacitidine was approved by the FDA in 2004 for the treatment of all subtypes of MDS according to the FAB classification. Azacitidine was approved in the EU in 2009 for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with intermediate-2 and High-Risk MDS (per IPSS), CMML with 10-29% bone marrow blasts without myeloproliferative disorder and AML with 20-30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia. In 2015, the EU expanded the approval of azacitidine in AML to include adult patients aged 65 years or older who are not eligible for HSCT with >30% myeloblasts according to the WHO classification. 1.2.16. Azacitidine Toxicities Per the VIDAZA® EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), the following (very common 1/10) adverse reactions associated with azacitidine treatment were obtained from clinical studies and post marketing surveillance: pneumonia, nasopharyngitis, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, anorexia, decreased appetite, hypokalemia, insomnia, dizziness, headache, dyspnea, epistaxis, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, petechiae, pruritus, rash, ecchymosis, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, pyrexia, asthenia, chest pain, injection site erythema, injection site pain, injection site reaction (unspecified), and weight decreased. 1.2.16.1. Azacitidine Dosing Schedule The dosing schedule in the safety LIC is 75 mg/m2/day SC for 7 consecutive days every 28 days. In the expansion component, azacitidine will be administered per local label or per the Investigational Product Manual (or SPC). Azacitidine may be administered by SC injection or IV infusion at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days every 28 days. Alternate dosing schedules to administer the 7 doses to accommodate patient and treatment center availability are allowed. A trial which compared 3 different azacitidine schedules36 showed 44% HI (22/50) for the 5-2-2 dosing schedule (95% CI, 31 to 60) another trial (AZA 001), showed 49% HI in the , azacitidine arm (87/177) (p <0.0001). There are no data showing that varying 7 day schedules are not equivalent, therefore, the Investigators can choose the appropriate schedule based on the standard of care at their institution. 1.2.16.2. Azacitidine Dose Modifications For azacitidine dose modification, refer to the local label or the Investigational Product Manual (or SPC). Complete information for azacitidine may be found in the SRSD, which for this study is the EU SPC for Vidaza®.27 1.2.17. Rationale for Testing Glasdegib in Combination with Azacitidine in Patients with Previously Untreated Higher-Risk MDS, AML, and CMML The combination of glasdegib with azacitidine is proposed for testing in this therapeutic setting based on:  Clinical and pre-clinical data suggesting a role for aberrant Hh pathway activation in MDS, AML and CMML (See Section 1.2.2 and 1.2.3);  Non-clinical data demonstrating that glasdegib limits LSC proliferation and evidence of glasdegib synergy with chemotherapy (See Section 1.2.2);  The acceptable safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile observed for glasdegib in clinical studies in patients with hematological malignancies both as a single agent and in combination with decitabine and azacitidine (see Section 1.2.6);  The clinical activity observed following single-agent and combination treatment with glasdegib in patients with select hematological malignancies (see Section 1.2.6);  The glasdegib pharmacodynamic data for Hh pathway inhibition obtained in surrogate tissues from a limited number of patients (n=18) with select hematological malignancies and advanced solid tumors (see Section 1.2.13.2). The above data along with the high unmet medical need for more effective therapies (higher response rates and hematologic improvement that translate into survival benefit) for patients with higher-risk MDS, AML, and CMML, support the evaluation of glasdegib in combination with azacitidine in this population. 1.2.18. Rationale for the Starting Dose of Gladegib As reported in Section 1.2.13.1, the B1371001 study identified the MTD for single-agent glasdegib continuous administration as 400 mg QD, and the RP2D as 200 mg QD in patients with select hematologic malignancies. Subsequent evaluation of potential dose levels for further studies in patients with hematologic malignancies suggested the 100 mg QD dose level (MTD -4) as the optimal starting dose of single agent glasdegib. This was supported by the following data:  Clinical benefit observed in 16 patients in the B1371001 study (including some with a diagnosis MDS and CMML) with doses of glasdegib as low as 10 mg QD, with the highest frequency of responses being observed at 80 mg QD;  GLI1 (a biomarker of Hh pathway signaling activation) expression is down regulated by 80% at doses of 50 mg QD and higher in surrogate (skin) tissue, suggesting there will be adequate target modulation at the 100 mg QD dose;  Potential for increase in glasdegib plasma exposures in the presence of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor(s) (~140% increase in AUC and a 40% increase in the C ) inf max such as azoles which are medically necessary for management of infections in AML patients.  Taking into consideration the observed clinical activity, safety and tolerability profile, modulation of hedgehog pathway activity in surrogate tissue, and information relating to the possible impact of a CYP3A4 inhibitor, a dose of 100 mg QD was chosen as the appropriate glasdegib starting dose for further clinical studies both as a single agent and in combination. In the randomized Phase 2 portion of Study B1371003 (Section 1.2.13.3), clincal benefit was demonstrated with LDAC ± glasdegib (100 mg Qday continuously in 132 first line AML patients. The mOS was 8.8 months (80% CI: 6.9, 9.9) vs. 4.9 months (80% CI: 3.5, 6.0) for LDAC alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.513 [80% CI: 0.394-0.666]. The safety profile of glasdegib + LDAC was generally tolerable and manageable.  In the single arm Phase 2 portion of Study B1371003 (Section 1.2.13.3), for older AML pts receiving intensive chemotherapy, the mOS stratified by subgroup was improved by adding glasdegib. The combination of glasdegib with ‘7+3’ was well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with that typically seen in AML patients receiving standard intensive chemotherapy. These data provides additional rationale for the 100 mg QD dose of glasdegib being a safe 1.2.19. Assessment of the Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Potential between Glasdegib and Azacitidine Glasdegib has been shown to be extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 (99.8%) using human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. For azacitidine, the exact route of elimination and metabolic fate is not known in humans. One of the pathways of elimination for azacitidine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase principally located in the liver but also in granulocytes, the intestinal epithelium, and whole blood (Vidaza® US package insert). The potential for a DDI was considered to be low for the glasdegib and azacitidine, as enzyme systems other than CYP3A may be involved in the metabolism of azacitidine. However, since this was a combination setting for dosing of glasdegib and azacitadine, a DDI assessment was conducted in twelve subjects as part of the safety LIC. Based on preliminary PK results, there was no evidence of changes in the PKs of either glasdegib or azacitadine when dosed in combination as compared to single agent dosing. 1.2.20. Summary of Benefit-Risk Assessment An evaluation of the anticipated risks and benefits of treatment with glasdegib in the defined patient population as required in Article 3(2)(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC (cf. Article 6(3)(b) of Directive 2001/20/EC) has been conducted. Based on the available clinical data, the safety profile of glasdegib as a single agent and in combination administered orally on a once daily continuous dosing regimen is characterized by manageable and potentially reversible toxicities that are generally mild to moderate in severity. The key observed toxicities are: muscle spasms, dysgeusia, decreased appetite, and alopecia. Small but significant increases in the QTc interval have been reported in non-clinical studies with glasdegib. Across the clinical program at glasdegib doses of 100 mg QD, cases of QTcF prolongation >500 msec or change in QTcF >60 msec from baseline have been reported, generally in settings of multiple confounders; causal relationship could not be determined. Specific dosing modification and additional monitoring may apply in case of prolonged QTcF (refer to Section 5.4.5.1 and Table 14). Concomitant administration of glasdegib with moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (Appendix 6 and Appendix 7) and drugs with known risk of Torsade de Pointes (TdP) (Appendix 5) is not recommended due to the potential for DDI to prolong the QTc interval. In a thorough QT (TQT) study (Study B1371023), a large effect (>20 msec, the threshold of clinical concern for cancer drugs) of glasdegib on the QTc interval was not demonstrated at therapeutic (exposure equivalent to 100 mg QD) and supratherapeutic (exposure equivalent to 200 mg QD) doses. The largest mean QTc interval change at any time point following the therapeutic dose was 8.03 msec. The upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CIs for all time-matched least squares (LS) mean differences between glasdegib and placebo was below 20 msec (the maximum 90% CI upper bound was 15.6 msec at the supratherapeutic dose). Based on PK-PD analysis in cancer patients, there was no observed relationship between glasdegib concentration and heart rate. The predicted mean change in QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) from baseline was 5.30 msec (95% CI: 4.40,     3.3. Expansion Patients with previously untreated Intermediate, High, or Very High risk MDS per IPSS-R (n=30) or patients with AML who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy (n=30) will receive glasdegib 100 mg orally once/day in combination with azacitidine per local label or per the Investigational Product Manual (or SPC). Azacitidine may be administered by SC injection or IV infusion at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days every 28 days. Alternate dosing schedules to administer the 7 doses to accommodate subject and treatment center availability are allowed. The attribution of ‘not being candidates’ for intensive chemotherapy will be determined by the Investigator based on the patient’s baseline eligibility, comorbidities and other factors according to 2017 ELN recommendations. The primary objective of the expansion component is to demonstrate that the CR rate of the combination treatment in each patient population is reasonably better than the historical CR rate for azacitidine alone in that population using a Bayesian decision criteria allowing early stopping for futility. Patients in the expansion MDS and AML cohorts will be enrolled continuously. The CR rate among the MDS and AML patients will be continuously monitored throughout the expansion component. After a certain number of patients have been enrolled in each cohort (Table 8 and Table 9, respectively) and observed for at least 28 weeks for the expansion MDS cohort and 24 weeks for the expansion AML cohort, the Sponsor will conduct a review of the CR rate within each expansion cohort to determine if the minimum number of responses are achieved to continue enrollment into that cohort. If the minimum number of CRs in any group is not achieved, then study enrollment will stop for futility. If the study is stopped for futility, patients on active treatment that are deriving clinical benefit will continue on study treatment until they meet the criteria for discontinuation (Section 3.3.1). The Bayesian prior parameter assumptions for each cohort are based on glasdegib combination study data in the respective populations, while prior assumption for control groups are based on historical control data.56 Analysis of specific safety criteria will be performed to evaluate stopping enrollment for a specifc cohort when there is at least 70% probability that the toxicity rate of any of the below pre-defined safety events of interest in that cohort is above 25% (Section 9.7.2):  Treatment-related deaths that occur during study treatment through 28 days following the last dose of any study treatment, or the beginning of another anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  Drug-induced liver injury (Hy’s Law cases), confirmed as detailed in Section 8.6.2, that occurs during study treatment through 28 days following the last dose of any study treatment, or the beginning of another anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  Grade 3 non-hematologic treatment-related AEs in the first cycle of treatment that have failed to recover to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 within 21 days from when the second cycle is due to start (corresponding to recovery before or/on Day 49 of the first cycle) and required permanent discontinuation of study treatment.  Grade 4 treatment-related neutropenia (ANC <500/mm3) lasting 42 days from the start of cycle 1 in the presence of bone marrow hypoplasia without evidence of active AML or MDS. A safety event of interest is defined as any of the above deemed related to glasdegib and /or azacitidine as assessed by the investigator. All AEs will be classified according to CTCAE version 4.03. The safety stopping criteria will be applied within a cohort (AML or MDS) starting when at least 10 patients have completed the required follow-up period (28/24 weeks for MDS/AML respectively) and applied continuously afterwards. Enrollment will continue unless the stopping boundary is crossed (Table 10). The same stopping criteria will be used for the AML and MDS cohorts; however, the two cohorts will be analyzed independently. Table 8. MDS Efficacy Decision Criteria Table 9. AML Efficacy Decision Criteria 30 Full enrollment Table 10. Safety Decision Criteria *Patients who have completed the required follow-up period (ie, 28/24 weeks for MDS/AML respectively) or patients who have experienced any pre-defined safety events of interest within the required follow-up period will be counted. **A weak prior of Beta (0.5,0.5) was used in the calculation. Figure 3. Schematic of Study Design *MDS patients enrolled in the Safety Lead-In component must have Intermediate-2 or High-Risk disease according to IPSS. MDS patients enrolled in the Expansion component must have Intermediate, High, or Very High risk disease acoording to IPSS-R. 3.3.1. Study Treatments Treatment will be administered in 28-day cycles. Glasdegib will be administered at the starting dose of 100 mg orally once/day and continuously in combination with azacitidine. Safety Lead-In Cohort The safety lead-in cohort has been completed.  All patients will be administered glasdegib, 100 mg orally once/day and continuously;  Azacitidine will be administered SC at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day on a continuous schedule from Day 1 to Day 7 of each cycle (Schedule 1). Patients with >30% BM blasts OR a rapidly progressive increase in the proportion of BM blasts at any point during the course of treatment must discontinue the study drug combination and enter follow up. Expansion  All patients will be administered glasdegib 100 mg orally once daily and continuously;  Azacitidine will be administered per local label or per the Investigational Product Manual (or SPC). Azacitidine may be administered by SC injection or IV infusion at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days every 28 days. Alternate dosing schedules to administer the 7 doses to accommodate patient and treatment center availability are allowed. Since responses to azacitidine may require 4-6 cycles of administration to emerge, treatment with the study drug combination should be continued for at least 6 cycles, or until death, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal whichever occurs first. If documentation of disease progression occurs within the first 6 cycles of study treatment the patient SHOULD NOT be withdrawn from study treatment if, in the Investigator’s judgment, the patient is still likely to receive clinical benefit. Treatment with the study drug combination should be continued beyond 6 cycles of treatment until objective disease progression or relapse, unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal or death, whichever occurs first. Treatment should also be continued beyond 6 cycles if patients demonstrate reasonable evidence of clinical benefit, defined as HI or better in patients enrolled into the safety LIC, SD + HI or better in MDS patients enrolled to the expansion, and not meeting the criteria for disease progression for AML patients enrolled into the expansion. If glasdegib is permanently discontinued for reasons other than objective disease progression, patient refusal, or consent withdrawal, single-agent treatment with azacitidine may be continued if, in the Investigator’s judgment, a clinical benefit has been observed and following discussion between the Investigator and Sponsor. In cases of unacceptable toxicity or pregnancy, the patient must be withdrawn from study drug combination and entered into the follow-up phase. When study treatment with both drugs (glasdegib and azacitidine) is permanently discontinued, patients will enter into the follow-up phase. Patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment will be followed up for survival for up to 2 years from the first visit of the last patient enrolled in the expansion component of the study, or until death, lost to follow-up, or consent withdrawal. 3.3.2. Study Assessments Summary Patients will be followed for efficacy throughout the study by means of bone marrow aspirates. Following study entry, bone marrow biopsies will only be required if adequate bone marrow aspirates are not obtained. A CR or PR response needs to be confirmed at least 4 weeks following the BM evaluation by assessing the stability of improved counts on PB, an additional bone marrow confirmatory specimen is not required (applies to all patients in the safety LIC and only MDS patients in the expansion component). CCI Transfusional support (red blood cells and platelets) will also be recorded. Timely and complete (bone marrow AND peripheral blood counts) disease assessments at screening and during the study, whenever clinically indicated, are essential. Failure to perform any of the required disease assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status for that time point and may weaken the conclusions of the study. Safety assessments (laboratory, instrumental and clinical) and PK assessments will be performed regularly during the active treatment period in both components of the study. DDI assessments were performed in the safety LIC only. CCI Please refer to the Schedule of Activities for the Safety Lead-in Cohort and the Schedule of Activities for the Expansion: MDS and AML Patients for a complete list of assessments to be performed on patients in the study. 4.

Lifestyle Guidelines In this study, male subjects who are able to father children and female subjects who are of childbearing potential will receive azacitidine, a compound that has been shown to cause congenital malformations in animals and glasdegib, a compound which has been associated with teratogenic risk. Subjects who are, in the opinion of the investigator, sexually active and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must agree to use at least 1 highly effective form of contraception throughout the study and for at least 180 days after the last dose of investigational product. Male subjects must, additionally, use a condom to prevent potential transmission of investigational product in seminal fluid. The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the subject, will confirm that the subject has selected at least 1 appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject and his/her partner(s) from the list of permitted contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has been instructed in their consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the Table 3 Schedule of Activities for the Expansion: MDS and AML Patients, the investigator or designee will inform the subject of the need to use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly and document the conversation, and the subject’s affirmation, in the subject’s chart. In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the subject or partner(s). Highly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and include the methods described in Table 11. Table 11. Methods of Birth Control 4.4. Sunlight Exposure Patients will be advised to report any reaction to sun exposed skin. In addition, special precautions will be taken to limit any potential photo irritation effect, by minimizing the patients’ exposure to light including high intensity ultraviolet b (UVb) sources such as tanning beds, tanning booths and sunlamps. Patients should be advised to apply sunscreen/sunblock daily. 4.5. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the Study Reference Manual. To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study numbers, contact information for the investigational site, and contact details for a help desk in the event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patient’s participation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should only be used in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The help desk number is not intended for use by the patient directly, and if a patient calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigational site. 5. STUDY TREATMENTS 5.1. Allocation to Treatment 5.1.1. Safety Lead-In Cohort and Expansion During both components of the study, allocation of patients to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) System [Interactive Web Response (IWR)/Interactive Voice Response (IVR)]. The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, protocol number and the date of birth of the patient. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when drug is being supplied via the IRT. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the patient number and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. There is a 24 hour a day, 365 days a year IRT helpdesk available for any questions or issues. The study-specific IRT reference manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT. Note: The IRT is the source of the patient number. The IRT system will provide the patient number at the end of the first IRT patient transaction. In the Safety LIC and expansion, allocation to treatment will occur in an open label fashion. 5.2. Patient Compliance For glasdegib, all patients will maintain patient dosing diaries throughout the study which will record the date of administration and all regular, missed, changed, or delayed doses. Patients are required to return all bottles, unused study drug and the patient dosing diary, at each cycle and at End of Treatment visit for compliance assessment and drug accountability. The number of tablets returned by the patient at the end of the cycle will be counted, documented and recorded. For azacitidine provided by the Sponsor, the site should complete the required dosage Preparation Record located in the Study Reference Manual. The use of the Preparation Record is preferred but it does not preclude the use of an existing appropriate clinical site documentation system. The existing clinical site's documentation system should capture all pertinent/required information on the preparation and administration of the dose including the methodology used to calculate the patient body surface area. This may be used in place of the Preparation Record after approval from the Sponsor. 5.3. Drug Supplies 5.3.1. Formulation and Packaging 5.3.2. Glasdegib Glasdegib will be supplied by Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development as 25 mg and 100 mg tablets for oral administration. Supplies will be labeled according to local regulatory requirements. Glasdegib will be packaged in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles and should be handled with care. Each bottle will contain enough medication for a 28-day cycle of daily dosing, plus an additional amount to cover the time between site visits. Patients should be instructed to keep their medication in the bottles provided and not transfer it to any other containers and return the bottles to the site at the next study visit. Site personnel must ensure that patients clearly understand the directions for self-medication. Investigational product should be dispensed by an appropriately qualified and experienced member of the study staff (eg, physician, nurse, physician’s assistant, practitioner, or pharmacist) as allowed by local, state, and institutional guidance. 5.3.3. Azacitidine Azacitidine 25 mg/mL powder for suspension for injection will be used in this study. Please refer to the local package insert (or SPC) or the investigational product manual for detailed formulation, preparation and IV and SC administration instructions. Only qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to them and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of chemotherapeutic agents. 5.4. Administration 5.4.1. General Guidelines Both study drugs are administered in 28-day cycles. Cycle duration maybe extended beyond 28 days to allow resolution of toxicities related to study treatments. It is suggested that sites contact the patients via phone during the first week of Cycle 1 and anytime there is a dose reduction just to confirm that the patient adequately understands the dosing instructions. Glasdegib will be self-administered by the patient at home, unless otherwise specified. Glasdegib will be administered orally with approximately 8 ounces (240 mL) of water and should be taken in the morning, at the same time each day. Tablets must not be crushed or cut; they must be swallowed whole, not manipulated or not chewed prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to self-administer their medication in the morning at approximately the same time each day and to not take more than the prescribed dose at any time. If a patient forgets to take their dose at the regularly scheduled time, and if less than 10 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, that dose should be taken as soon as possible. If more than 10 hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, the dose should be skipped and the patient should continue on their normal dosing schedule. If a patient misses a day’s dose entirely, they must be instructed not to “make it up” the next day. If a patient vomits any time after taking a dose, they must be instructed not to “make it up,” but to resume subsequent doses the next day as prescribed. If a patient inadvertently takes 1 extra dose during a day, the patient should not take the next dose of glasdegib. The patient will be reminded NOT to take their dose at home on clinic days but to bring their bottle(s) and patient dosing diary into clinic so that glasdegib may be administered there. Patients requiring glasdegib dose reduction(s) will be administered multiples of 25 mg tablets and should continue taking the glasdegib at the same time each morning at the dose prescribed by the Investigator (ie, 75 mg QD and 50 mg QD in the form of three or two 25 mg tablets respectively). In situations where clinical benefit is observed, glasdegib can be reduced below 50 mg QD upon Sponsor approval. Dose modifications are discussed in Section 5.4.5. 5.4.2. Safety Lead-In Cohort The safety lead-in cohort has been completed.  Azacitidine will be administered SC daily at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day on Days 1-7 (every 28 days). No other dosing schedule is permitted.  Glasdegib will be orally administered daily and continuously. In Cycle 1 only, administration of glasdegib will commence on Day 2 of the cycle (C1D2) to permit DDI evaluation. The starting dose will be 100 mg.  Dose modifications are discussed in Section 5.4.5. 5.4.3. Expansion  Azacitidine will be administered per local label or per the Investigational Product Manual (or SPC). Azacitidine may be administered by SC injection or IV infusion at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days every 28 days. Alternate dosing schedules to administer the 7 doses to accommodate patient and treatment center availability are allowed.  Glasdegib will be orally administered daily and continuously. The starting dose will be 100 mg daily. Dose modifications are discussed in Section 5.4.5. 5.4.4. Treatment Duration Since responses to azacitidine may require 4-6 cycles of administration to emerge, treatment with the study drug combination should be continued for at least 6 cycles, or until death, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal whichever occurs first. If documentation of disease progression occurs within the first 6 cycles of study treatment the patient SHOULD NOT be withdrawn from study treatment if, in the Investigator’s judgment, the patient is still likely to receive clinical benefit. In the safety LIC, patients with >30% BM blasts OR a rapidly progressive increase in the proportion of BM blasts at any point during the trial, must discontinue the study drug combination and enter follow-up. Treatment with the study drug combination should be continued beyond 6 cycles of treatment until objective disease progression or relapse, death, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal whichever occurs first. Treatment should also be continued beyond 6 cycles if patients demonstrate reasonable evidence of clinical benefit, defined as HI or better in patients enrolled into the safety LIC, SD + HI or better in MDS patients enrolled to the expansion, and not meeting the criteria for disease progression for AML patients enrolled into the expansion. If glasdegib is permanently discontinued for reasons other than objective disease progression, patient refusal, or consent withdrawal, single-agent treatment with azacitidine may be continued if, in the Investigator’s judgment, a clinical benefit has been observed and following discussion between the Investigator and Sponsor. In cases of unacceptable toxicity or pregnancy, the patient must be withdrawn from study drug combination and entered into the follow-up phase of the study. When study treatment with both drugs (glasdegib and azacitidine) is permanently discontinued, patients will enter into the follow-up phase. 5.4.5. Dose Modifications Every effort should be made to administer the study drug treatment according to the planned dose and schedule. In the event of significant toxicity, dosing must be interrupted, delayed and/or reduced as outlined below. In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed. Patients must be instructed to notify investigators at the first occurrence of any adverse symptom/s. Dose modifications may occur in three ways:  Within a cycle: Dosing interruption until adequate recovery followed by dose reduction (if required) of glasdegib during a given treatment cycle.  Between cycles: The next treatment cycle may be delayed if toxicity from the preceding cycle persists.  In the next cycle: Dose reduction may be required based on toxicities experienced in the previous cycle. A cycle is determined by the azacitidine administration schedule. A cycle is 28 days, but will be extended if there are dose delays or modifications for azacitidine. Azacitidine administration should not be interrupted if glasdegib dosing is interrupted for toxicity. If start of glasdegib administration in the next cycle is delayed due to toxicities potentially attributable to glasdegib, azacitidine administration should not be delayed, and the day when azacitidine administration occurs will be counted as Day 1 of the next cycle for both study drugs. 5.4.5.1. Glasdegib Glasdegib does not need to be delayed or dose reduced for hematologic toxicity deemed unrelated/unlikely related to glasdegib by the Investigator. Patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities potentially attributable to glasdegib should have their glasdegib treatment interrupted regardless of when it occurs in the cycle until the toxicity resolves or returns to baseline or <Grade 1, as described in Table 13. If these parameters have not been met following >28 consecutive days of dose interruption, glasdegib should be permanently discontinued. If glasdegib treatment is permanently discontinued, patients may continue single agent treatment with azacitidine, if according to the investigator’s judgment a clinical benefit has been observed, and following discussion between the investigator and the sponsor. Appropriate follow-up assessments should be implemented until adequate recovery (toxicity resolves or returns to baseline) occurs. Depending on when the adverse event resolved, treatment interruption may lead to the patient treatment interruption recovers within the same cycle, re-commencement of dosing in that cycle is allowed. The need for a dose reduction at the time of treatment resumption should be based on the criteria outlined in Table 13, unless specifically agreed otherwise following discussion between the Investigator and the Sponsor. If a dose reduction for glasdegib is applied in the same cycle, the patient must return to the clinic to receive a new supply of drug. Glasdegib doses omitted for toxicity will not be replaced within that cycle (eg, cycles will not be prolonged beyond the 28 days in order to make up for any missed glasdegib doses during that cycle). Glasdegib may be interrupted or permanently discontinued for any reason as per good clinical practice. In the event of glasdegib treatment interruption for reasons other than treatment-related toxicity (eg, elective surgery) for a duration >28 days, the details of treatment resumption will be determined in consultation with the Sponsor. Dose reduction of glasdegib by 1 or, if necessary, 2 dose levels (Table 12) will be allowed depending on the type and severity of toxicity encountered. NOTE: In the specific situations where clinical benefit is observed, glasdegib can be reduced below 50 mg QD upon Sponsor approval. All dose modifications/adjustments must be clearly documented in the patient's notes and case report form (CRF). Once the glasdegib dose has been reduced, all subsequent cycles should be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reduction is required. Dose re-escalation is not allowed. Deviations from any of the dose modifications must be discussed and agreed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. Table 12. Available Dose Levels * NOTE: If clinical benefit is observed, glasdegib may be reduced below 50 mg QD following Sponsor approval. Dose modifications for treatment-related non-hematologic toxicities (excluding QTc prolongation, muscle spasms, and myalgia) are outlined in Table 13.     5.5. Drug Storage The investigator, or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist will ensure that all investigational products, including any comparative agents and/or marketed products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under recommended storage conditions and in accordance with applicable site and regulatory requirements. Storage conditions stated in the SRSD (IB for glasdegib and EU SPC for Vidaza®27) will be superseded by the storage conditions stated in the labeling. Glasdegib should be stored as described on the drug label. Note that the storage conditions in any study documentation will be superseded by the storage conditions stated on the product label. Patients should be instructed to keep their medication in its original container. Returned medication should be stored at the clinical site separately from medication that needs to be dispensed. Azacitidine will be stored according to the labeled storage conditions. Investigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (ie, manually or by using alarm systems to alert of any excursions) and ensure that thermometers are working correctly as required for proper storage of investigational products. These include thermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage. Any temperature excursions should be reported to the sponsor. The investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor. Once a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product. Site systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products). This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout study. Even for continuous monitoring systems, a log or site procedure which ensures active daily evaluation for excursions should be available. The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularly inspected to ensure it is maintained in working order. Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported upon discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to labeled storage conditions, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor. Once a temperature excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product. Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site. Site staff will instruct patients on the storage requirements for take home medications 5.6. Drug Accountability The investigator’s site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the drug supplies. At each dispensing visit (Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, etc. or when there is a dose reduction), all unused or partially used bottles must be returned by patients to the Investigator. The number of tablets returned by the patient at the end of the cycle will be counted, documented and recorded. The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational product (eg, at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the study site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by sponsor or designee and all destruction must be adequately documented. 5.7. Concomitant Treatment(s) All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the CRF. Any prior treatment received within 28 days prior to study entry (including hematopoietic growth factor receptor agonists: erythropoietin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), romiplostim, eltrombopag) will be recorded in the CRF. In addition, any transfusion (red blood cells or platelets) within 8 weeks prior to screening should be recorded in the CRF. All prior immunosuppressive therapy (eg, cyclosporine) used to treat MDS, or all prior cyto-reduction therapy (eg, hydroxyurea) used to treat AML or CMML, will be recorded regardless of when they were received by the patient. Information collected will include dates of use, best treatment response and the reasons for stopping therapy. Every concomitant treatment, blood products, growth factors, as well as interventions, required by the patients during the active study treatment (and up to 28 days following last study drug administration or until initiation of another anti-cancer treatment) and the reason for its administration must be recorded on the CRF. All concomitant medications the patient is currently receiving must be reviewed by the Sponsor prior to enrollment in the safety LIC. Study entry criteria are defined in Section 4. 5.7.1. Restricted or Prohibited Concomitant Medications The following medications are not allowed during the active study treatment period:  Agents used to treat AML or MDS; for control of rapidly progressing leukemia, hydroxyurea and/or leukopheresis may be used before and for up to 1 week after the first dose of glasdegib;  Investigational agents;  CYP3A4/5 Inducers: A drug-drug interaction study in health subjects with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in a 70% decrease in plasma exposures (AUC ) inf and a 35% decrease in peak plasma concentration (C ) of a single 100-mg oral dose max of glasdegib. Therefore co-administration of glasdegib and moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inducers is not permitted. A comprehensive list of moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inducers is provided in Appendix 4. However, if you are uncertain whether a concomitant medication is contraindicated, you should contact the Sponsor study team. The following medications have use restrictions during the active study treatment period:  CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors: In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP enzymes indicated that glasdegib metabolism is primarily mediated by the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4/5. Clinically, there is likelihood that glasdegib plasma concentrations may be increased in the presence of co-administered inhibitors of the CYP3A4/5 enzymes. In a healthy volunteer study, ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, produced a 2.4-fold increase in plasma exposure and a 1.4-fold increase in peak plasma concentration of glasdegib. Therefore a potential exists for drug-drug interactions with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, and co-administration of glasdegib in combination with moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors is not recommended. Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is recommended. Moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (Appendix 6 and Appendix 7) should be used with caution and only if considered medically necessary. If a moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is to be initiated in addition to glasdegib, the guidance provided in Section 7.6 and dose modifications for QT prolongation per Table 14 must be followed.  Drugs with a known risk of Torsade de pointes (TdP): Glasdegib has been shown to have the potential to prolong the QTc interval in pre-clinical studies and at doses >200 mg (see Section 1.2.20 for summary of TQT study). While the glasdegib dose being evaluated in this study is 100 mg, the concomitant administration of glasdegib and drugs with a known risk of Torsade de pointes should be avoided whenever possible. A list of such drugs is provided in Appendix 5. Use of these drugs is not recommended unless there are no alternatives. If a TdP drug is to be initiated in addition to glasdegib, the guidance provided in Section 7.6 and dose modifications for QT prolongation per Table 14 must be followed.  QT prolonging medications (without a risk of TdP) should be avoided whenever possible.  Concomitant administration of multiple moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, TdP drugs, and/or QT prolonging medications (without a risk of TdP) is not recommended and must be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. 5.7.2. Permitted Concomitant Medications 5.7.2.1. Best Supportive Therapy Best Supportive Therapy (BST) administration is permitted according to Institutional guidelines for all patients on study. BST will be provided by the site and may vary depending on the patient’s signs and symptoms, site current practice, and country practice. It includes medications and supportive measures that may palliate disease-related symptoms, improve quality of life and treat bacterial, fungal or viral infections. BST may include:  Blood transfusions;  Platelet transfusions;  Antibiotics;  Anti-fungal agents;  Anti-viral agents. 5.7.2.2. Hematopoietic Growth Factors Hematopoietic growth factors (eg, G-CSF, GM-CSF) may be used according to local practice and guidelines. 5.7.2.3. Anti-Emetic and Anti-Diarrheal Therapy Patients should be pre-medicated with anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting before each dose of azacitidine in all cycles according to local practice and guidelines. Primary prophylaxis of diarrhea is permitted at the Investigator’s discretion. The choice of the prophylactic drug is up to the investigator assuming the drug is not contraindicated as described in Section 5.7.1. 5.7.3. Surgery Caution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The appropriate interval of time between surgery and glasdegib required to minimize the risk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping glasdegib is recommended at least 7 days prior to surgery. Post-operatively, the decision to reinitiate glasdegib treatment is up to the Investigator with Sponsor approval and should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound healing and recovery from surgery. 6. STUDY PROCEDURES 6.1. Screening Screening can be accomplished over one or multiple visits over a 4-week period (28 days), unless specifically noted otherwise (ie, bone marrow sample collection). Protocol specific tests or procedures not considered standard of care can only be done after the patient has signed the Informed Consent document. The Informed Consent document may be signed up to 60 days prior to study entry. See the Schedule of Activities for the Safety Lead-in and the Schedule of Activities for the Expansion: MDS and AML Patients for a complete list of assessments and procedures to be collected during the screening visit. 6.2. Study Period See the Schedule of Activities for the Safety Lead-in and the Schedule of Activities for the Expansion: MDS and AML Patients for a detailed list of the assessments and procedures to be collected. Study entry is defined as when the patient is enrolled into the IRT system. Patients must be enrolled into the IRT system prior to receiving first dose of study drug. All assessments on Cycle 1 Day 1 should be collected pre-dose, unless documented otherwise. 6.3. End of Treatment Visit The End of Treatment Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible once a patient has been withdrawn from study drug. For a detailed list of assessments and procedures to be completed please refer to the Schedule of Activities for the Safety Lead-in and the Schedule of Activities for the Expansion: MDS and AML Patients. 6.4. Follow-up The first follow up contact should occur at least 28 days, and no more than 35 days after the last dose of study drug to capture any potential adverse events (refer to Section 8.2) and to confirm appropriate contraception usage (refer to Section 4.3). Contact with the patient may be done via phone. For a detailed list of assessments and procedures to be completed please refer to the Schedule of Activities for the Safety Lead-in and the Schedule of Activities for the Expansion: MDS and AML Patients. In cases of unacceptable toxicity or pregnancy, the patient must be withdrawn from study drug combination and entered into the follow-up phase of the study. Patients who permanently discontinue both study drugs (azacitidine and glasdegib) for any reason (except death, or withdrawal of patient consent) will enter into the follow-up phase. Patients continuing to experience toxicity following discontinuation of treatment will continue to be followed minimally every 4 weeks until resolution or determination, in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, that no further improvement is expected.   Study terminated by Sponsor;  Death. Reasons for withdrawal from study may include:  Study terminated by Sponsor;  Lost to follow-up;  Withdrawal of patient consent for any further contact;  Death. If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the patient. All attempts to contact the patient and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the patient’s medical record. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document patient outcome, if possible. The Investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the patient return all unused investigational product(s), request that the patient return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the patient regarding any unresolved AEs. If the patient withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further study specific evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 7. ASSESSMENTS Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol-required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, which may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the patient. When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that they have taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. 7.1. Pregnancy Testing For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study therapy - once at the start of screening and once at the baseline visit, immediately before investigational product administration. Following a negative pregnancy result at screening, appropriate contraception (defined in Section 4.3) must be commenced and a further negative pregnancy result will then be required at the baseline visit before the patient may receive the investigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the patient will be withdrawn from administration of study drug combination and enter into the Follow-up phase. Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Ethic Committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations. 7.2. Adverse Events Assessment of AEs will include the type, incidence, severity (graded by the NCI CTCAE version 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness. Additional information regarding AE and Serious AE (SAE) reporting is provided in Section 8. 7.3. Laboratory Safety Assessments Hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis assessments will be drawn at the time points described in the Schedule of Activities for the Safety Lead-in and the Schedule of Activities for the Expansion: MDS and AML Patients and will be analyzed by the site/Investigator at local laboratories. Laboratory certifications and normal ranges with units must be provided to the Sponsor. If hematology [Complete blood count (CBC) with differentials] is obtained within 3 days of scheduled blood draw, the collection need not be repeated. For those patients achieving a CR or PR, a CBC should be done at least 4 weeks after the BM assessment in order to confirm response (applies to all patients in the safety LIC and only MDS patients in the expansion component). Hematology tests may be repeated also as clinically indicated. If blood chemistry or coagulations are obtained within 3 days of scheduled blood draw, the collection need not be repeated. If a urinalysis was obtained within 3 days of the scheduled collection, it should not be repeated. For urinalysis, dipstick is acceptable. Microscopic analyses should be done if abnormal results (ie, the presence of protein or blood). See Appendix 8 for list of required tests. 7.4. Transfusions All red blood cell and platelet transfusions, including the date of each transfusion and number of red blood cell or platelet units transfused must be recorded while the patient is on treatment. Transfusion histories for the 8 weeks prior to screening must also be recorded in the CRF. Note that the number of units (not the number of bags) must be recorded. 7.5. Vital Signs and Physical Examination Vital signs will include blood pressure and heart rate (to be recorded in sitting position). Patients will have a physical exam (PE) including an examination of major body systems (includes general appearance, head, neck, lungs, heart, abdomen, musculoskeletal, extremities, skin, lymph nodes, neurological), measurement by palpation of spleen and liver,        Follow-up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. If a subject begins a new anticancer therapy, the recording period for non-serious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started; however, SAEs must continue to be recorded on the CRF during the above-indicated active collection period. Death must be reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatment. 8.3. Definition of an Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  Abnormal test findings;  Clinically significant symptoms and signs;  Changes in physical examination findings;  Hypersensitivity;  Drug abuse;  Drug dependency. Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:  Drug overdose;  Drug withdrawal;  Drug misuse;  Drug interactions;  Extravasation;  Exposure during pregnancy (EDP);  Exposure via breastfeeding;  Medication error;  Occupational exposure;  Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be reported as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed by measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be reported as AEs. 8.4. Medication Errors Medication errors may result, in this study, from the administration or consumption of the wrong product, by the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error case report form (CRF) which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page, and on the SAE form when appropriate. In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately. Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, including:  Medication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product;  Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participating patient. Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the adverse event (AE) page and, if applicable, any associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page. 8.5. Abnormal Test Findings The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows:  Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or  Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or  Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or  Test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or sponsor. Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 8.6. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  Results in death;  Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death);  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions);  Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the safety reporting period. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of disease progression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the study or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an AE and as an SAE with CTCAE Grade 5 (see Section 8.8 on Severity Assessment). Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.6.1. Protocol-Specified Serious Adverse Events There are no protocol-specified SAEs in this study. All cases of Grade >2 mQTcF prolongation regardless of causality and treatment arm must be reported as an SAE for up to 28 calendar days after the last dose of study drug administered. All SAEs will be reported by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety database (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements). 8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy’s law cases) and should always be considered important medical events. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential case of drug-induced liver injury depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Patients who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:  Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST or ALT values 3 times the upper limit of normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value 2 X ULN with no evidence of hemolysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 2 X ULN or not available.  For patients with preexisting ALT OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the ULN, the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned above:  For patients with preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values 2 times the baseline values and 3 X ULN, or 8 X ULN (whichever is smaller). Concurrent with  For patients with preexisting values of total bilirubin above the normal range: Total bilirubin level increased from baseline by an amount of at least 1 X ULN or if the value reaches ≥3 X ULN (whichever is smaller). The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment. The possibility of hepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary) should be considered. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/ international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline phosphatase. A detailed history, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and supplement consumption, family history, occupational exposure, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no other cause for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities identified at the time, should be considered potential Hy’s law cases irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the abnormal LFTs. Such potential Hy’s law cases should be reported as SAEs. A potential Hy’s law case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of reasonable investigations have excluded an alternative etiology. 8.7. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit should be assessed for medical importance. Hospitalization does not include the following:  Rehabilitation facilities;  Hospice facilities;  Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);  Skilled nursing facilities;  Nursing homes;  Same-day surgeries (as outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include:  Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of persistent pre-treatment laboratory abnormality);  Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);  Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);  Protocol-specified admission during a study (eg, for a procedure required by the study protocol);  Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective cosmetic surgery);  Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;  Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;  Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products. Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 8.8. Severity Assessment AEs will be reported using concise medical terminology (verbatim) as well as the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) term for Adverse Events (Version 4.03, Publish Date: June 14, 2010, http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html)) listed in the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. The investigator may use the following definitions of Severity in accordance with CTCAE Version 4.03 to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event. Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above. 8.9. Causality Assessment The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if applicable. An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by the sponsor (see the section on Reporting Requirements). If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational product,” this should be clearly documented on study records. In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. 8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy occurs if: 1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product; An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products). 2. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy. If a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this information to the Pfizer drug safety unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form and Exposure During Pregnancy (EDP) supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Follow-up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows:  Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;  Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product. Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the investigator. Further follow-up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.11. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event. An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an associated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study, the information is not reported on a Case Report Form (CRF), however a copy of the completed SAE Report form is maintained in the investigator site file. 8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF page. When a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below. 8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study patient/legally acceptable representative. In addition, each study patient/legally acceptable representative will be questioned about AEs. 8.14. Reporting Requirements Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs. If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate. 8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements If an SAE occurs, Pfizer Safety is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the event. In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE information. This time frame also applies to additional new information (follow-up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as well as to the initial and follow-up reporting of exposure during pregnancy, exposure via breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases. In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (eg, if an outpatient study patient initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his or her first awareness of the AE. For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above. In addition, an investigator may be requested by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow up information in an expedited fashion. This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured on the AE CRF. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its designated representative. 8.14.2. Non-serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF. Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information. 8.14.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. 9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS A detailed methodology for summary and statistical analysis of the data collected in this study will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan will be maintained by the Sponsor. The document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  9.3.1. Complete Response The proportion of patients achieving CR is the primary endpoint for the expansion cohorts. The endpoint of CR will be analyzed when the endpoint is mature in the specific expansion cohort. A confirmation of response (peripheral blood only) is required 4 weeks after the first assessment per IWG 2006 for MDS patients. The final analyses for MDS cohorts will be performed after all patients in the expansion MDS cohort have been followed for at least 28 weeks (to allow for confirmation of response per IWG 2006). No confirmation is needed for the expansion AML cohort. The final anslyses for the AML cohort will be performed after all patients in this cohort have been followed for at least 24 weeks. The proportion and two-sided 95% CI of patients achieving CR will be provided separately for the two expansion cohorts. 9.3.2. Response Rate The proportion of patients achieving response (CR+PR) is a secondary endpoint for the safety LIC. A confirmation of response (Peripheral Blood only) is required 4 weeks after the first assessment per IWG 2006. The final analyses will be conducted after all patients in the safety LIC have been followed for 28 weeks (to allow for confirmation of response per IWG 2006). The proportion and two-sided 95% CI (using exact method) of patients achieving response (CR+PR) will be provided for the safety LIC. 9.3.3. Overall Survival (Expansion) Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of first study treatment to date of death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive will be censored at the date of last contact. OS will be analyzed and displayed graphically for each expansion cohort separately using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median event time for each expansion cohort and corresponding two-sided 95% CI will be provided. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival probabilities at 12, 18, and 24 months and their two-sided 95% CI (using log-log transformation and back-transformation) will be provided for each arm separately. First, OS will be analyzed when the primary endpoint of CR is analyzed in the respective expansion cohort. A follow-up analysis of updated OS will be conducted when the study concludes. OS is defined as the date of the first dose of any of the study medications to the date of death from any cause. 9.3.4. Duration of Response Duration of Response (DoR) is only defined in MDS patients or AML patients achieving a CR in the expansion component. DoR is defined as the duration from date of first achieving CR to the date of disease progression (relapse) after CR, or death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive who are free from disease progression or relapse after CR are censored at the date of the last assessment that verifies their disease status. The minimum DoR is 4 weeks for MDS patients by definition (CR must last at least 4 weeks to qualify as such per    In all summaries, emphasis will be placed on treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), namely, those with initial onset or that worsen in severity after the first dose of study drug. Adverse events will be summarized by the frequency of patients experiencing treatment emergent adverse events corresponding to body systems and MedDRA preferred term and by worst NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) grade. Summaries will also be provided of treatment related TEAEs, namely, those judged by the investigator to be related or likely related to study drug. Adverse events leading to death or discontinuation of study treatment, events classified as NCI CTCAE version 4.03 Grade 3 or higher, study drug related events, and serious adverse events will be considered with special attention. Adverse events reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. 9.4.4. Laboratory Test Abnormalities The number and percentage of patients who experienced laboratory test abnormalities will be summarized according to worst toxicity grade observed for each lab assay, graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03. The analyses will summarize laboratory tests both on the entire study period and by cycle (Cycle 1 and Cycles beyond 1). Shift tables will be provided to examine the distribution of laboratory toxicities. For laboratory tests without CTC grade definitions, results will be categorized as normal, abnormal or not done. 9.4.5. Baseline Characteristics Patient characteristics at the time of study entry will be summarized in frequency tables and descriptive statistics will be provided for quantitative variables for the full analysis set (see Section 9.2 for definitions of study populations). 9.4.6. Electrocardiogram Analysis The QT measurements corrected by heart rate (QTc) will be used for the data analysis and interpretation. QTcF is planned to be the primary analysis method for the QTc endpoint. In addition a study-specific correction method (QTcS) and QTcB may also be evaluated for the QTc evaluable patients. The most appropriate correction method that eliminates any QT vs. RR relationship may be chosen after review of the data. 9.4.7. Summary and Categorical Analysis of Electrocardiogram Findings The analysis of ECG results will be based on patients with both baseline and on-treatment ECG data. All ECGs obtained during the study will be evaluated for safety. ECG collected prior to the first day of dosing will be considered the baseline ECG. ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate measurements) will be used for the statistical analysis and all data presentations. Any data obtained from ECGs repeated for safety reasons after the nominal time-points will not be averaged along with the preceding   9.6.4. Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis or PK/PD Modeling PK and PD data from this study may be analyzed using modeling approaches and may also be pooled with data from other studies to investigate any causal relationship between glasdegib exposure and CCI significant safety endpoints. The results of these analyses, if performed, may be reported separately. 9.7. Interim Analyses 9.7.1. Futility Analyses A Bayesian decision rule (Section 3.3) will be used to continuously monitor CR rate without holding enrollment in the expansion component to allow early stopping of the study for futility. The decision rule is to stop enrollment for a specific expansion cohort if the posterior probability of the CR rate in study treatment is no more than 0.2 higher than historical azacitidine is greater than 95% in an expansion cohort, ie, Pr (glasdegib+Aza response < historical Aza reponse + 0.2) >0.95. The prior distribution assumptions for the Bayesian model are as follow: for MDS cohort, we assume a prior distribution of Beta(1,6) for the study treatment (based on data from MDS patients accumulated in the safety LIC [1 out of 7 MDS patients achieved CR]), and a prior distribution of Beta(15,75) by discounting historical CR rate by half (AZA 001 trial); for the AML cohort, a prior distribution of Beta(4,4) for the study treatment (based on pooled data on AML patients from the B1371003 study [1 out of 4 AML patients achieved CR] and the LIC [3 out of 4 AML patients achieved CR]), and a prior distribution of Beta(23.5,97) by discounting historical CR rate by half.57 The Multc Lean software (Version 2.1.0) developed by MD Anderson Cancer Center is used (https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/softwaredownload/SingleSoftware.aspx?Software_Id=12), which properly models variability in historical control that is more often than not ignored. Stopping for toxicity is not modeled. The Bayesian decision rule applies once the minimum number of patients (ie, 10) in each expansion cohort has achieved the required follow-up duration (ie, 28 weeks for the expansion MDS cohort and 24 weeks for the expansion AML cohort). The enrollment to the respective expansion cohort will be stopped if the minimum number of responders in that expansion cohort is not achieved (Table 8 for expansion MDS cohort, and Table 9 for expansion AML cohort in Section 3.3). For instance, if there are no more than 4 responders in the first 17 patients who have achieved 28 weeks follow-up, the enrollment into the expansion MDS cohort should be stopped for futility. 9.7.2. Safety Stopping Analyses Analysis of specific safety criteria will be performed to evaluate stopping enrollment for a specifc cohort when there is at least 70% probability that the toxicity rate of any of the pre-defined safety events of interest (Section 3.3) in that cohort is above 25%. The safety stopping criteria will be applied within each cohort (AML or MDS) starting when at least 10 patients have completed the required follow-up period (28/24 weeks for MDS/AML respectively) and applied continuously afterwards. Enrollment will continue unless the stopping boundary is crossed (Table 10 in Section 3.3). Patients who have completed the required follow-up period or patients who have experienced any pre-defined safety events of interest within the required follow-up period will be included in the safety decision making. The same stopping criteria will be used for the AML and MDS cohorts; however, the two cohorts will be analyzed independently. 9.8. Data Monitoring Committee This study will use an external data monitoring committee (EDMC). The EDMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety of subjects in the study according to the charter. The recommendations made by the EDMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision. Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. An EDMC will be convened to monitor safety in the study at least once per year. 10. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE During study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. The study site may be subject to review by the institutional review board (IRB)/ethics committee (EC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 11. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study. A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient. The completed original CRFs are the sole property of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete, CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry. In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the physician's patient chart. In these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearly identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent/assentdocuments, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained by the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), according to local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met. 12. ETHICS 12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent/assent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file. Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation. 12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Patients (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Practive (GCP) (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 & 2008). In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH guideline on GCP, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. 12.3. Patient Information and Consent All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names or other identifiable data in any reports, publications or other disclosures, except where required by laws. When study data is compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, patient names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical code consisting of a numbering system provided by Pfizer in order to de-identify the study patient. The study site will maintain a confidential list of patients who participated in the study linking their numerical code to the patient’s actual identity. In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of patient personal data consistent with applicable privacy laws. The informed consent/assent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements including applicable privacy laws. The informed consent/assent document(s) used during the informed consent process must be reviewed by the sponsor, approved by the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection. The investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his or her legally acceptable representative, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation. Whenever consent is obtained from a patient’s legally acceptable representative, the patient’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the capacity to provide assent, as determined by the IRB/EC. If the investigator determines that a patient’s decisional capacity is so limited he/she cannot reasonably be consulted, as permitted by the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, then the patient’s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not obtained. If the study patient does not provide his/her own consent, the source documents how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient’s legally acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study patient (eg, parent, spouse) and that the patient’s assent was obtained, or waived. If assent is obtained verbally it must be documented in the source documents. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative before any study-specific activity is performed unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by an IRB/EC. The investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed consent/assent document. 12.4. Patient Recruitment Advertisements approved by ethics committees and investigator databases may be used as recruitment procedures. 12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable competent authority in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any new information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures taken by the investigator to protect the study patients against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of. 13. DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL End of Study in all participating countries is defined as Last Patient Last Visit. 14. SPONSOR DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB/EC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of glasdegib at any time. If a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly notify the investigator. After notification, the investigator must contact all participating patients and the hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within 14 days. As directed by Pfizer, all study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible. 15. PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS 15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with applicable local laws/regulations. In all cases, study results are reported by Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and complete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the study or the country in which the study was conducted. www.clinicaltrials.gov Pfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies conducted in patients that evaluate the safety and/or efficacy of a Pfizer product, regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted. US Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary completion date for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the primary completion date for studies in pediatric populations. Primary completion date is defined as the date that the final patient was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary outcome, whether the clinical study concluded according to the prespecified protocol or was terminated. EudraCT Pfizer posts EU Basic Results on EudraCT for all Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies that are in scope of EU requirements. EU Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary completion date for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the primary completion date for studies in pediatric populations. www.pfizer.com Pfizer posts Public Disclosure Synopses (clinical study report synopses in which any data that could be used to identify individual patients has been removed) on www.pfizer.com for Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies at the same time the US Basic Results document is posted to www.clinicaltrials.gov. 15.2. Publications by Investigators Pfizer has no objection to publication by an investigator of any information collected or generated by the investigator, whether or not the results are favorable to the investigational drug. However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or unprotected inventions, the investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity to review any proposed publication or other type of disclosure before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed. The investigator will provide manuscripts, abstracts, or the full text of any other intended disclosure (poster presentation, invited speaker or guest lecturer presentation, etc.) to Pfizer at least 30 days before they are submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed. If any patent action is required to protect intellectual property rights, the investigator agrees to delay the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days. The investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed confidential information (other than the study results themselves) before disclosure. If the study is part of a multicenter study, the investigator agrees that the first publication is to be a joint publication covering all centers. However, if a joint manuscript has not been submitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the study at all participating sites, the investigator is free to publish separately, subject to the other requirements of this section. For all publications relating to the study, the institution will comply with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II - “Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Publication of study results is also provided for in the CSA between Pfizer and the institution. In this section entitled Publications by Investigators, the defined terms shall have the meanings given to them in the CSA. 16. REFERENCES  Jadersten M, Hellström-Lindberg E.

France Appendix This appendix applies to study sites located in France. 1. GCP Training Prior to enrollment of any subjects, the investigator and any sub-investigators will complete the Pfizer-provided Good Clinical Practice training course (“Pfizer GCP Training”) or training deemed equivalent by Pfizer. Any investigators who later join the study will complete the Pfizer GCP Training or equivalent before performing study-related duties. For studies of applicable duration, the investigator and sub-investigators will complete Pfizer GCP Training or equivalent every three years during the term of the study, or more often if there are significant changes to the ICH GCP guidelines or course materials. 2. Investigational Product No subjects or third-party payers will be charged for investigational product. 3. Inspections The investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its service provider immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its service provider to prepare the study site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its service provider (if not prohibited by law) to be present during the inspection. The study site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the subject's medical records. The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its service provider. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its service provider with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings.
