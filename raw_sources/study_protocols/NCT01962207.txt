Investigator name Signature Date Detailed Title A phase IIIb, open, multi-center study to evaluate the long- term antibody persistence at 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years after the administration of one dose of the meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-TT versus one dose of Meningitec® vaccine or one dose of the meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine Mencevax® ACWY, and to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine administered 10 years after primary vaccination of 1-10 year old subjects with MenACWY-TT, Meningitec® or Mencevax® ACWY. Indication Active immunization of individuals from 12 months of age against invasive meningococcal diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. Rationale for the In study MenACWY-TT-027, 613 healthy subjects between 1 study and study and 10 years of age were randomized using a (3:1) ratio to design receive either a single dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine or a meningococcal C conjugate vaccine or a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The subjects were followed up for antibody persistence over five years post-vaccination in studies MenACWY-TT-028 through -032. The results showed that subjects vaccinated with MenACWY-TT between ages 1 and 2 years of age had detectable antibodies five years after vaccination in 73.5%, 77.6%, 34.7% and 42.9% of subjects against serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, respectively. Subjects vaccinated with MenACWY-TT at 2-10 years of age in this same study showed that five years after vaccination 90.8%, 90.8%, 78.6% and 78.6% of subjects had detectable antibodies against A, C, W-135 and Y serogroups, respectively. The main purpose of this study is to continue to evaluate the antibody persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years post- administration of MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine as compared to Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY when given to healthy subjects 1 to 10 years of age. In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine administered to all eligible subjects 10 years after the primary vaccination will be evaluated.

For azoospermia, ‘documented’ refers to the outcome of the investigator’s/designee’s medical examination of the subject or review of the subject’s medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject’s medical records. Adverse event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. kept unaware of the treatment assignment in order to reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, and only when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level of quality will appropriate personnel be unblinded or when required in case of a serious adverse event. Child in care: A child who has been placed under the control or protection of an agency, organisation, institution or entity by the courts, the government or a government body, acting in accordance with powers conferred on them by law or regulation. The definition of a child in care can include a child cared for by foster parents or living in a care home or institution, provided that the arrangement falls within the definition above. The definition of a child in care does not include a child who is adopted or has an appointed legally acceptable representative. Container number A number identifying a treatment to a subject, according to the study randomisation or treatment allocation. Core Data Sheet The Core Data Sheet (CDS) represents the internal company medical position for all labeling documents worldwide. The CDS is a document containing all essential safety information, such as contraindications, warnings/precautions, and undesirable effects, which Pfizer requires to be included in the proposed labeling of all countries where the product is marketed. The Core Data Sheet also contains indications and dosing information (for all dosage forms) supported worldwide, as well as pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and non- clinical information that has important bearing on the safe and effective use of the product. Information contained in the Core Data Sheet is based on valid, scientific/medical data. The Core Data Sheet is a vehicle by which information on a marketed product is communicated to the appropriate stakeholders worldwide. Eligible: Qualified for enrolment into the study based upon strict adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria. set of consecutive time points. Generally, an epoch is self-contained and allows to perform a data analysis to address some of the trial objectives (e.g. primary, booster, yearly follow-ups,…). Evaluable: Meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures defined in the protocol, and, therefore, included in the according-to-protocol (ATP) analysis. Immunological correlate The defined humoral antibody response above which of protection: there is a high likelihood of protection in the absence of any host factors that might increase susceptibility to the infectious agent. Investigational A pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo vaccine/product: being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorisation when (Synonym of used in a way different from the approved form, or when Investigational Medicinal used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain Product) further information about an approved use. Menarche: Menarche is the onset of menses for the first time in a young female and is preceded by several changes associated with puberty including breast development and pubic hair growth. Menarche usually occurs within 1-2 years of breast development, thelarche. However, a young female can become pregnant before her first menses. Thus, a conservative definition of non-childbearing potential in a pre-menarcheal female is a young female who has not yet entered puberty as evidenced by lack of breast development (palpable glandular breast tissue). Potential Immune- Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) are a subset Mediated Disease of AEs that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology.

Background Invasive diseases caused by Neisseria meningitidis are serious threats to global health. The infection rates are highly age dependent. The risk of meningococcal disease is highest in infancy, with a secondary, slightly smaller peak in late adolescence [Rosenstein, 2001]. Case-fatality rates of invasive disease are around 10% and up to 20% of patients who recover develop significant long-term sequelae [Healy, 2002]. Prevention of meningococcal disease relies on effective immunization programs. The most common serogroups are A, B, C, W-135 and Y [Harrison, 2010]. Meningococcal disease affects mostly young children with a second peak in adolescents (15-19 year age group). For those vaccinated during early childhood a booster might be needed before adolescence and for those vaccinated as young adolescent’s long-term antibody persistence is needed to ensure protection throughout this peak in disease incidence [Cohn, 2010]. Hence there is a need to understand how long immunity persists in case of re-exposure through frequent travels. Currently, there are three quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines available in various countries worldwide for vaccination of children and adolescents/adults; MenACWY diphtheria toxoid (DT) conjugate vaccine (Menactra, Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) is authorised for active immunization of subjects aged 9 months to 55 years in the US [Menactra Product Information, 2009; Menactra Approval Letter, 2011], Canada and Gulf Cooperation States in the Middle East. MenACWY CRM-197 conjugate vaccine (Menveo, GSK) is authorised for active immunization of subjects from 2 years of age in the European Union [EPAR, 2012] and Australia [Menveo Consumer Medicine Information, 2010], and from 2 through 55 years of age in Canada and the United States [Menveo Product Monograph, 2010; Menveo Prescribing Information, 2011]. A quadrivalent vaccine (Nimenrix) was developed for the prevention of invasive infections with Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135, using tetanus toxoid as the carrier. This vaccine, which was granted a marketing authorisation on 20 April 2012 by the European Commission and licensed in Canada for individuals 12 months to 55 years as of March, 2013, has been shown to be immunogenic and well tolerated in individuals as of 12 months of age [European Commission, 2012]. Pfizer completed the acquisition of Nimenrix and Mencevax on 01 October 2015, and will therefore assume responsibility of sponsor for this study. Please refer to the current Core Data Sheet (CDS) for information regarding the pre-clinical and clinical studies and the potential risks and benefits of the MenACWY-TT vaccine. The CDS is the single reference safety document for this study. In study MenACWY-TT-027, 613 healthy subjects between 1 and 10 years of age were randomized using a (3:1) ratio to receive either a single dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine or a meningococcal C conjugate vaccine or a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The subjects were followed up for antibody persistence over five years post-vaccination in studies MenACWY-TT-028 through -032. The results showed that subjects vaccinated with MenACWY-TT between ages 1 and 2 years of age had detectable antibodies five years after vaccination in 73.5%, 77.6%, 34.7% and 42.9% of subjects against serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, respectively. Subjects vaccinated with MenACWY-TT at 2-10 years of age in this same study showed that five years after vaccination 90.8%, 90.8%, 78.6% and 78.6% of subjects had detectable antibodies against A, C, W-135 and Y serogroups, respectively. The main purpose of this study is to continue to evaluate the antibody persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years post- administration of MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine as compared to Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY when given to healthy subjects 1 to 10 years of age. In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine administered to all eligible subjects 10 years after the primary vaccination will be evaluated. 2. OBJECTIVE(S) 2.1.

STUDY COHORT 4.1. Number of subjects/centres Six hundred and thirteen subjects (460 in the ACWY-TT group, 75 in the MenCCRM group and 78 in the MenPS group) were enrolled and vaccinated in study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658). The subjects who were vaccinated in the vaccination phase of study MenACWY-TT-027 and received either MenACWY-TT vaccine, Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY will be eligible for this study if they meet the inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria. At the time of the study and prior to every visit, the investigator will contact all of the subjects/parents/legally acceptable representative(s) (LAR[s]) who agreed to participate in a subject declines participation, refusal will be documented in the source documents. Subjects will be able to enter the study at any visit up to Visit 5. An informed consent form for this protocol must be signed prior to any study-related procedure. Any subject who turns of legal age during the study and had previously given assent will need to sign an informed consent form. Subjects will be able to participate in any study visit 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 independent of other study visits, at their own or at their parent/LAR’s discretion as applicable (e.g., it is possible that a subject comes to Visit 1 and Visit 3 but not Visit 2). Refer to Section 10.3 for the accuracy expected from the estimated sample size with respect to the primary objective. 4.2. Inclusion criteria for enrolment Deviations from inclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. All subjects must satisfy the following criteria at study entry to the persistence phase:  Subjects and/or subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits).  A male or female who has received a primary vaccination with the MenACWY-TT, Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY vaccines in study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658).  In alignment with local laws and regulations, written informed consent obtained from parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject and written informed assent obtained from the subject if the subject is less than 15 years of age, or written informed consent obtained from the subject if the subject has achieved the 15th birthday. The subjects 15 years of age at the time of enrolment will sign the informed consent form, even if the parent/ LAR previously signed the ICF before the subject reached the legal age of consent.  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and history-directed physical examination before entering into the study. All subjects must satisfy the following additional criteria prior to entry of the booster phase:  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, hysterectomy or bilateral ovariectomy.

CONDUCT OF THE STUDY 5.1. Regulatory and ethical considerations, including the informed consent process The study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. (GCP), all applicable subject privacy requirements and the guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 & 2008), as well as the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002). The study has been designed and will be conducted in accordance with the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for clinical investigation of medicinal products in the paediatric population (ICH E11) and all other applicable ethical guidelines. Pfizer will obtain favourable opinion/approval to conduct the study from the appropriate regulatory agency, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, prior to a site initiating the study in that country. Conduct of the study includes, but is not limited to, the following:  Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) review and favourable opinion/approval of study protocol and any subsequent amendments.  Subject/ subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) informed consent and subject informed assent, as appropriate.  Investigator reporting requirements as stated in the protocol. Pfizer will provide full details of the above procedures to the investigator, either verbally, in writing, or both. Freely given and written informed consent must be obtained from each subject and/or each subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and subject informed assent, as appropriate, prior to participation in the study. Pfizer will prepare a model Informed Consent Form (ICF) which will embody the ICH GCP and Pfizer required elements. While it is strongly recommended that this model ICF is to be followed as closely as possible, the informed consent requirements given in this document are not intended to pre-empt any local regulations which require additional information to be disclosed for informed consent to be legally effective. Clinical judgement, local regulations and requirements should guide the final structure and content of the local version of the ICF. In accordance with the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, those subjects who can only be enrolled in the study with the consent of the subject’s legally acceptable representative (e.g. minors), should be informed about the study to the extent compatible with the subject’s understanding and, if capable, the subject should sign and personally date a written informed assent form (IAF). It is required that the assent be signed by each subject, if capable, in addition to the informed consent that is to be signed by his/her legal study population and the local requirements. If the subject reaches the age of consent during the study they will be asked to provide consent at the next study visit (if applicable). This procedure should be applied according to local laws and regulations. The investigator has the final responsibility for the final presentation of the ICF, respecting the mandatory requirements of local regulations. The ICF generated by the investigator with the assistance of the sponsor’s representative must be acceptable to Pfizer and be approved (along with the protocol, and any other necessary documentation) by the IRB/IEC. 5.2. Subject identification and randomisation of treatment 5.2.1. Subject identification Approximately 488 subjects are expected to participate in this study (183 subjects from the ACWY<2 and ACWY2 groups each, and 61 subjects from the MenCCRM and MenPS groups each). Subjects will retain the same subject number as in MenACWY-TT-027 (108658). 5.2.2. Study group and treatment allocation All subjects who received either MenACWY-TT, Mencevax ACWY or Meningitec in study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658) will be eligible for this study if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. All subjects that were vaccinated in MenACWY-TT-027 will be invited to participate in this study. Approximately, 488 subjects are expected to participate in the study. There will be no randomization for allocation to study groups in this study. The subjects in this study will be allocated to the same groups as in the vaccination study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658). Subjects will be allocated a new container number. Allocation of subjects to vaccine groups will proceed through the use of an interactive response technology (IRT) system. The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, the subject number and the date of birth of the subject. The site personnel will then be provided with a vaccine assignment and dispensable unit (DU) or container number. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the subject number and DU or container number assigned. After obtaining the signed and dated ICF/IAF from the subject/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) and having checked the eligibility of the subject at the subject’s first persistence visit in the study, the site staff in charge of the vaccine administration will access IRT. Upon providing the subject the dose. The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine Administration screen. When IRT is not available, please refer to the IRT user guide or the Study Procedures Manual (SPM) for specific instructions. 5.3. Method of blinding This study will be conducted in an open manner. Any person involved in the clinical conduct of the study (including data cleaning) will stay as blind as possible during the study. The laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing will be blinded to the treatment, and codes will be used to link the subject and study (without any link to the treatment attributed to the subject) to each sample. 5.4. General study aspects Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the accompanying SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact the safety of the subjects. 5.5.

ESFU: Extended Safety Follow-Up  is used to indicate a study procedure that requires documentation in the individual eCRF. O is used to indicate a study procedure to be captured in site source records that does not require documentation in the individual eCRF. *Subjects/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be contacted by phone 4-8 weeks beforehand to come in for the persistence visit. The subject may return at any visit during the persistence epochs.1Informed consent is only required at Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 or Visit 5 if the informed consent form was not signed at previous study visits, i.e. if either Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 or Visit 5 is the first persistence visit for a given subject. Subjects will be able to participate in any study visit 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 independent of other study visits, at their own or at their parent/LAR’s discretion as applicable (e.g., it is possible that a subject comes to Visit 1 and Visit 3 but not Visit 2). 2 Check of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the persistence epochs at Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 and Visit 5 is only required if these checks were not performed at a previous study visit, i.e. if Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 or Visit 5 is the first persistence visit for a given subject. 3 Note that Visit 5 is part of the persistence epoch (Month 126: Visit 5) as well as the pre-booster vaccination visit. Thus if a subject first enters the study at Visit 5, eligibility criteria for both the persistence epoch and for the booster epoch will be checked. 4 Including since the last visit from the last persistence study the subject attended until the enrollment visit in this extension study. 5 If the subject returns for the Visit 6 blood draw prior to the end of the 31-day safety follow-up period (Day 30), the subject will continue to record safety information on the diary card until 31 days post-vaccination (Day 30), and will mail the diary card into the site. 6 See section 6.5.2 for medications and timeframe for recording. 7 These conditions include: Any confirmed or suspected condition that has the capability of altering the subject's immune response (e.g. intercurrent lymphopenia, the occurrence of meningococcal disease, any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition and diagnosis of serious chronic illness) collected throughout the study along with other AEs. 8 This will also include SAE(s) leading to withdrawal of the subject from the study. Occurrence of meningococcal diseases should be reported as SAEs and documented in the AE screen in the eCRF during the entire study period. 9 When the subject comes in for the first visit in the current study, SAEs related to study vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy experienced since the last persistent time point the subject participated in should also be recorded. C0921004 (MenACWY-TT-100 EXT:027 Y6,7,8,9,10, 200171) Protocol Amendment 2 10 This will also include SAE(s) leading to the withdrawal of the subject from the study. 11 New onset of chronic illnesses (NOCIs) (e.g. autoimmune disorders, allergies, type 1 diabetes, asthma) will be recorded from Visit 5 until the end of the study and will be recorded as unsolicited AEs or SAEs as appropriate.. A non-exhaustive list of NOCIs is shown in Table 13. 12 In the event of GBS, subjects/subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) should be contacted to obtain clinical details as outlined in the 'Potential immune mediated disorders (pIMDs): standard questionnaires and list of preferred terms'. All occurrences of GBS have to be recorded as an SAE. 13 Recording will start after administration of the vaccine dose. 14 Pregnancies occurring between vaccination (Day 0) and 31 days after vaccination (Day 30) will be recorded. Subjects will be questioned at Month 132, 6 months after the booster vaccination, whether any unreported pregnancies occurred between Day 0 and Day 30 and these pregnancies will be recorded retrospectively. If, after having been vaccinated, a subject is found to have been pregnant at vaccination, the pregnancy will be recorded as an exclusion criterion. 15 To be completed for all subjects who are enrolled in the study strictly followed. These intervals determine each subject’s evaluability in the according-to- protocol (ATP) analyses. Subjects are able to participate in any study visit 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 independent of other study visits, at their own or at their parent/LAR’s discretion as applicable (e.g., it is possible that a subject comes to Visit 1 and Visit 3 but not Visit 2). Table 5 presents the intervals between study visits. Table 5 Intervals between study visits 1 Whenever possible the investigator should arrange study visits within this interval. 2 Subjects will not be eligible for inclusion in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity if they make the study visit outside this interval. 3 For the safety evaluation an interval of 30 days is needed. If the subject returns for Visit 6 prior to Day 30, they should take home the diary card, continue to record unsolicited safety information until Day 30 and then provide the card to the study site. 5.6. Detailed description of study procedures 5.6.1. Informed consent The signed informed consent of the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) must be obtained before study participation. The signed informed assent of the subject below the age of consent (i.e. minor) should be obtained in addition to the signed informed consent by his/her parent(s)/LAR(s) according to local rules and regulations. Refer to Section 5.1 for the requirements on how to obtain informed consent and assent, as appropriate. If the subject becomes of legal age during the course of the study the subject will be asked to sign the ICF per local regulation. Only the informed consent date at study entry will be collected in the eCRF. 5.6.2. Check inclusion and exclusion criteria Check all inclusion and exclusion criteria as described in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 before enrolment. Record demographic data such as date of birth and gender in the subject’s eCRF. 5.6.4. Medical history Obtain the subject’s medical history by interview and/or review of the subject’s medical records and record any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the persistence epochs in the eCRF. 5.6.5. Recording of meningococcal and TT vaccination history Record the history of meningococcal vaccination and the last tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccination date prior to the start of each epoch in the eCRF. 5.6.6. History directed physical examination Perform a history directed physical examination. If the investigator determines that the subject’s health on the day of vaccination temporarily precludes vaccination, the visit will be rescheduled. Collected information needs to be recorded in the eCRF. Treatment of any abnormality observed during this examination has to be performed according to local medical practice outside this study or by referral to an appropriate health care provider. 5.6.7. Pre-vaccination assessment of contraception The investigator or his/her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use adequate contraception consistently and correctly according to the glossary of terms (and outline of study procedures) and document such conversation in the subject’s medical records. In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the subject or the subject’s partner. 5.6.8. Urine pregnancy test For female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed immediately before administration of each vaccine dose. A negative pregnancy test result is required before the subject may receive the study vaccine. In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject will be withdrawn from administration of study vaccine but may remain in the study. Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request of institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations. Note: The urine pregnancy test must be performed even if the subject is menstruating at the time of the study visit. Contraindications, warnings and precautions to vaccination must be checked at the beginning of the vaccination visit. Refer to Section 6.4 for more details. 5.6.10. Assess pre-vaccination body temperature The axillary, rectal, oral or tympanic body temperature of all subjects needs to be measured prior to any study vaccine/ product administration. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral. If the subject has fever [fever is defined as temperature  37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or  38.0°C for rectal route] on the day of vaccination, the vaccination visit will be rescheduled within the allowed interval for this visit (see Table 5). 5.6.11. Container number allocation Container number allocation will be performed as described in Section 5.2. The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF. 5.6.12. Sampling Refer to the Module on Biospecimen Management in the SPM for detailed instructions for the collection, handling and processing of the samples. 5.6.12.1. Blood sampling for immune response assessments Blood samples will be taken during certain study visits as specified in Section 5.5 List of Study Procedures.  A volume of approximately 7 mL (10 mL at visits 4, 5 and 6) of whole blood (to provide approximately 2.5 mL of serum [or 5 mL of serum at visits 4, 5 and 6]) should be drawn from all subjects included in the immunogenicity sub-cohort for each analysis of humoral immune response at each pre-defined time point. After centrifugation, serum samples should be kept at –20°C or below until shipment. Refer to the SPM for more details on sample storage conditions. 5.6.13. Study Vaccine administration  The study vaccine will be administered at Visit 5. After completing all prerequisite procedures prior to vaccination, one dose of study vaccine will be administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid of preferably the non-dominant arm (refer to Section 6.3 for detailed description of the vaccine administration procedure). If the investigator or delegate determines that the subject’s health on the day of administration temporarily precludes vaccine administration, the visit will be rescheduled within the allowed interval for this visit (refer to Table 5).  The time of reconstitution and administration of the vaccine will be recorded. the vaccine, with appropriate medical treatment readily available in case of anaphylaxis. 5.6.14. Check and record concomitant medication/vaccination and intercurrent medical conditions Concomitant medication/vaccination must be checked and recorded in the eCRF as described in Section 6.5. Intercurrent medical conditions must be checked and recorded in the eCRF as described in Section 6.6. 5.6.15. Recording of AEs, SAEs and pregnancies  Refer to Section 8.2 for procedures for the investigator to record AEs, SAEs and pregnancies. Refer to Section 8.3 for guidelines on how to submit SAE and pregnancy reports to Pfizer.  The subjects/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately should they/the subjects manifest any signs or symptoms they perceive as serious.  At the vaccination visit a diary card will be provided to the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s). The subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will record body (oral) temperature and any solicited local/general AEs (i.e. on the day of vaccination and during the next 3 days) or any unsolicited AEs (i.e. on the day of vaccination and during the next 30 days occurring after vaccination). The subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to return the completed diary card to the investigator at the next study visit. Note: Diary cards can be filled in by a minor subject under the supervision of the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) provided that the minor has the competency to assess and report the information to be provided in the diary card. The ultimate accountability for the completion of the diary cards remains with the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s). The investigator should discuss this accountability with the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s).  Collect and verify the completed diary card during discussion with the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) on Visit 6. Note: If the diary card has been filled in by a minor subject, the investigator or delegate should verify the reported information during a discussion with the minor subject preferably in the presence of his/her parent(s)/LAR(s).  Any unreturned diary cards will be sought from the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) through telephone call(s) or any other convenient procedure. The investigator will transcribe the collected information into the eCRF in English. 5.6.15.1. Recording of GBS and NOCIs  Please refer to Section 8.2 for procedures for the investigator to record GBS and NOCIs. Refer to Section 8.3 for guidelines on how to report GBS and NOCIs. ‘Potential immune mediated disorders: standard questionnaires and list of preferred term’. All occurrences of GBS have to be reported as SAE(s).  NOCIs (e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma, type 1 diabetes, allergies) will be reported as unsolicited AEs or SAE as appropriate. 5.6.16. Study conclusion The investigator will:  review data collected to ensure accuracy and completeness  complete the Study Conclusion screen in the eCRF. 5.7. Biological sample handling and analysis Please refer to the SPM for details on biospecimen management (handling, storage and shipment). See section 5.6.12 for a brief description of the procedure for collection, preparation and storage of serum samples. Samples will not be labelled with information that directly identifies the subject but will be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number). Under the following circumstances, additional testing on the samples may be performed outside the scope of this protocol:  Collected samples may be used in other assays, for test improvement or development of analytical methods related to the study vaccine and its constituents or the disease under study.  Collected samples may be used for purposes related to the quality assurance of data generated linked to the study vaccine or the disease under study, such as for maintenance of assays described in this protocol and comparison between analytical methods and/or laboratories. Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from Pfizer. Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s). Refer also to the Investigator Agreement, where it is noted that the investigator cannot perform any other biological assays except those described in the protocol or its amendment(s). If additional testing is performed, the marker priority ranking given in Section 5.7.4 may be changed. Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years (counting from when the last subject performed the last study visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject consent. These When materials are provided by Pfizer or designee, it is MANDATORY that all clinical samples (including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively using those materials in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the exclusion of the subject from the ATP analysis (See Section 10.4 for the definition of study cohorts/ data sets to be analysed). The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel and the laboratory(ies) under his/her supervision comply with this requirement. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM. 5.7.2. Biological samples Table 6 presents the volume and time each biological sample will be taken. Table 6 Biological samples 5.7.3. Laboratory assays Please refer to APPENDIX A for a detailed description of the assays performed in the study. Please refer to APPENDIX B for the address of the clinical laboratories used for sample analysis. Serological assays will be performed at Public Health England (PHE; Manchester, UK) and Neomed Institute (Laval, Quebec, Canada) using standardised and validated procedures (refer to Table 7). *PHE = Public Health England (formerly HPA = Health Protection Agency) **Neomed Institute Laval, Quebec, Canada. 5.7.4.1. Immunological read-outs Table 8 provides the immunological read-outs. Table 8 Immunological read-outs be analysed according to priority ranking provided in Table 8. Note that the rSBA assays will take priority over the hSBA assays. 5.7.5. Immunological correlates of protection Bactericidal assay using rabbit complement (rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY): Bactericidal antibodies are recognized as surrogate markers of protection. The 1:8 cut-off was shown to be the most consistent with observed efficacy at 4 weeks after vaccination with the meningococcal C conjugate vaccine in post-licensure efficacy estimates in the United Kingdom [Andrews, 2003]. The threshold for protection for other serogroups is still to be defined, although it is common practice to extend the 1:8 cut-off to rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY [Centres for Disease Control, 2006; WHO, 2011]. Bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135 and hSBA-MenY): For MenC, a baseline serum bactericidal titre of 1:4 was a strong predictor of protection [Goldschneider, 1969]. To date, no MenA, MenW-135 and MenY baseline serum bactericidal titre predictive of protection has been published. However, in the absence of a demonstrated correlate of protection for MenA, MenW-135 and MenY, it has been common practice to extend the 1:4 cut-off to hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenW-135 and hSBA-MenY as well. Persistence phase At each immunogenicity time point investigators will be provided with the immunogenicity results and group allocation for all subjects participating at their centre when the individual listings of the statistical report have been released. Booster phase Immunogenicity results and group allocation for subjects at the investigators centre will be provided when the individual listings of the statistical report have been released. When a generally accepted correlate of protection exists, individual immunological assay results for the subjects identified as non-responders (i.e., antibody level below the established correlate of protection measured one month after vaccination.) could be defined using the following thresholds:  rSBA-MenC antibody titre < 1:8 and hSBA-MenC antibody titre <1:4 135 and Y, individual immunology assay results for these 3 antigens will also be provided to the study investigator. For the study subjects identified as non-responders, it remains the responsibility of the study investigator in charge of the subject’s clinical management to determine the medical need for re- vaccination and to re-vaccinate the subjects as per local/regional practices. 6. STUDY VACCINE AND ADMINISTRATION 6.1. Description of the study vaccine The vaccine (MenACWY-TT) to be used in this study was acquired by Pfizer on 01 October 2015. The vaccine is labelled and packed according to applicable regulatory requirements. Table 9 presents the description of the study vaccine. Table 9 Study vaccine *The lyophilized pellet of MenACWY-TT vaccine is to be reconstituted with the supplied saline solution. 6.2. Storage and handling of the study vaccine The study vaccine must be stored at the respective label storage temperature conditions in a safe and locked place. Access to the storage space should be limited to authorized study personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre-study activities under the responsibility of the sponsor study contact. The storage temperature should be continuously monitored with calibrated (if not validated) temperature monitoring device(s) and recorded. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for more details on storage of the study vaccine. Temperature excursions must be reported in degree Celsius. temperature excursion reporting and usage decision process, packaging and accountability of the study vaccine. Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported upon discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditions as described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor. Once an excursion is identified, the study vaccine must be quarantined and not used until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the study vaccine. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if the sponsor approves the use of the study vaccine after the temperature excursion. Use of the study vaccine prior to sponsor approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site. 6.3. Dosage and administration of study vaccine Table 10 Dosage and administration 1Intramuscular (IM) ; 2Deltoid (D) ; 3Non-Dominant is preferred Reconstitution of vaccine The lyophilized white pellet of MenACWY-TT vaccine is to be reconstituted with the supplied saline solution to obtain 0.5 mL for administration. Refer to the CDS for full reconstitution instructions. Injection technique A needle of at least 25 mm (1 inch), 22-25 gauge should be used for injection in the deltoid. The following injection technique is recommended:  Use of aseptic technique with reconstitution and delivery of injection. administration site taut between the thumb and forefinger, isolating the muscle.  Insert the needle fully into the muscle at a 90°C angle and inject the vaccine into the tissue.  Withdraw the needle and apply light pressure to the injection site for several seconds with a dry cotton ball or gauze. 6.4. Warnings and precautions Any specific warnings and precautions associated with the administration of MenACWY-TT have been mentioned in the exclusion criteria. The study vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly, intradermally or subcutaneously. Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesis and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 6.5. Concomitant medication/product and concomitant vaccination At each study visit/contact, the investigator should question the subject and/or the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) about any medication/product taken and vaccination received by the subject. 6.5.1. Recording of concomitant medications/products and concomitant vaccination The following concomitant medications/products/vaccines must be recorded in the eCRF if administered during the indicated recording period:  All concomitant medications/products, except vitamins and dietary supplements, administered for 30 days following the booster dose of study vaccine.  Any concomitant vaccination administered from study start and ending at visit 6.  Prophylactic medication (i.e. medication administered in the absence of ANY symptom and in anticipation of a reaction to the vaccination). E.g. an anti-pyretic is considered to be prophylactic when it is given in the absence of fever and any other symptom, to prevent fever from occurring [fever is defined as temperature  37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or  38.0°C for rectal route].  Any concomitant medications/products/vaccines listed in Section 6.5.2  Any concomitant medication/product/vaccine relevant to a SAE* or administered at any time during the study period for the treatment of a SAE*. elimination of a subject from ATP analyses The use of the following concomitant medications/products/vaccines will not require withdrawal of the subject from the study but may determine a subject’s evaluability in the ATP analysis.  Any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) used during the study period.  Immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs administered chronically (i.e. more than 14 days) during the study period. (For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone  10 mg/day or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.)  A vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol administered during the period starting from 30 days before the study vaccine dose and ending 30 days after *, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. *In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g.: a pandemic) is organised by the public health authorities, outside the routine immunisation program, the time period described above can be reduced if necessary for that vaccine provided it is licensed and used according to its CDS or PI (Prescribing Information) and according to the local governmental recommendations.  Administration of a meningococcal vaccine of any serogroup not foreseen by the study protocol at any time during the study period.  Immunoglobulins and/or any blood products administered during the study period.  Drug and/or alcohol abuse. A detailed, comprehensive list of reasons for elimination from ATP analyses will be established at the time of data cleaning. 6.6. Intercurrent medical conditions that may lead to elimination of a subject from ATP analyses At each study visit subsequent to the vaccination visit, it must be verified if the subject has experienced or is experiencing any intercurrent medical condition. If it is the case, the condition(s) must be recorded in the eCRF. The following may result in the elimination of subjects from the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, but not necessarily from the study:  Occurrence of meningococcal disease*.  Any confirmed or suspected condition that has the capability of altering the subject’s immune response (e.g. intercurrent lymphopenia).  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection based on medical history and physical * Occurrence of meningococcal disease should be recorded as an SAE. 7. HEALTH ECONOMICS Not applicable. 8. SAFETY The investigator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) as provided in this protocol. Each subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately should they/the subject manifest any signs or symptoms they perceive as serious. 8.1. Safety definitions 8.1.1. Definition of an adverse event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. Examples of an AE include:  Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication under study.  Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational vaccine(s)/product(s) administration even though they may have been present prior to the start of the study.  Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational vaccine(s)/product(s) or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE).  Signs, symptoms temporally associated with vaccine administration.  Pre- or post-treatment events that occur as a result of protocol-mandated procedures (i.e.  Occupational exposure. AEs to be recorded as solicited AEs are described in Section 8.1.6. All other AEs will be recorded as UNSOLICITED AEs. Examples of an AE DO NOT include:  Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.  Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).  Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a subject prior to the first study vaccination. These events will be recorded in the medical history section of the eCRF. 8.1.2. Medication Errors Medication errors may result, in this study, from the administration or consumption of the wrong product, by the wrong subject, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page, and on the SAE form when appropriate. In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately. Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, including:  Medication errors involving subject exposure to the study vaccine;  Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participating subject. Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the AE page and, if applicable, any associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page. Other examples include, but are not limited to:  The administration of expired study vaccine;  The administration of an incorrect study vaccine;  The administration of an incorrect dosage; specified storage range, unless it is determined by the sponsor that the study vaccine under question is acceptable for use. 8.1.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safety unit within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an associated AE/SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study, the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed SAE report form is maintained in the investigator site file. 8.1.4. Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy occurs if: 1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the study vaccine; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the study vaccine; 2. An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products). 3. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the study vaccine prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy. If a study subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study subject’s treatment with the study vaccine, the investigator must submit this information to the Pfizer drug safety unit on an SAE report form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [in a live- born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: • Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion; • Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study vaccine. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the investigator. Further follow- up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case-by-case basis (eg, follow-up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the study subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.1.5. Definition of a serious adverse event A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that: a. Results in death, b. Is life-threatening, Note: The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe. c. Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, Note: In general, hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been admitted at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospitalisation’ occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition (known or diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is NOT considered an AE. d. Results in disability/incapacity, Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject, OR f. Lack of efficacy. Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation. 8.1.6. Solicited adverse events 8.1.6.1. Solicited local (injection-site) adverse events The following local (injection-site) AEs will be solicited: Table 11 Solicited local adverse events If subjects/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) observe any large injection site reaction, they should contact the study personnel to determine if a visit to the investigator’s office for evaluation is necessary. A large injection site reaction is:  a swelling that measures more than 100 mm across where the vaccine was given, or  a noticeable irregular/uneven swelling where the vaccine was given, or activities (e.g., writing, use of computer, school attendance, sleeping, etc.). In case of questions or uncertainties, the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) should contact the investigator by phone and the investigator will determine whether or not a visit should be arranged. The investigator will record detailed information describing the AE on a specific large injection site reaction screen in the eCRF. An SAE report should also be completed if the large injection site reaction meets the definition of SAE. 8.1.6.2. Solicited general adverse events The following general AEs will be solicited: Table 12 Solicited general adverse events * The preferred route for temperature measurement is oral. Fever is defined as: 37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or 38.0°C for the rectal route. †Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain. Note: Temperature will be recorded in the evening. Should additional temperature measurements be performed at other times of day, the highest temperature will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.1.7. Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments qualifying as adverse events or serious adverse events In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g. medical imaging) that are judged by the investigator to be clinically significant will be recorded as AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Sections 8.1.1 and 8.1.2). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study will also be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by the investigator as more severe than expected for the subject’s condition, or that are present or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs or SAEs. The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. AEs of specific interest for safety monitoring include the occurrence of  NOCIs such as autoimmune disorders, asthma, type 1 diabetes and allergies. Refer to Section 8.1.8.1 for a non-exhaustive list of illnesses that can be recorded as NOCIs.  GBS (to be reported as an SAE).  Meningococcal disease (to be reported as an SAE). See Section 8.2 and 8.3 for information on recording and reporting of these events. 8.1.8.1. List of New Onset of Chronic Illnesses Table 13 presents a non-exhaustive list of illnesses that can be recorded as NOCIs.

Pregnancy Female subjects who become pregnant after the vaccination may continue the study at the discretion of the investigator. While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any adverse pregnancy outcome or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded and reported as an AE or a SAE. Note: The pregnancy itself should always be recorded on an Exposure During Pregnancy (EDP) form. The following should always be considered as SAE and will be reported as described in Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2:  Spontaneous pregnancy loss, including:  spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy loss before/at 22 weeks of gestation)  ectopic and molar pregnancy  stillbirth (intrauterine death of foetus after 22 weeks of gestation). Note: the 22 weeks cut-off in gestational age is based on WHO-ICD 10 noted in the EMA Guideline on pregnancy exposure [EMA, 2006]. It is recognized that national regulations might be different.  Any early neonatal death (i.e. death of a live born infant occurring within the first 7 days of life).  Any congenital anomaly or birth defect (as per [CDC MACDP] guidelines) identified in the offspring of a study subject (either during pregnancy, at birth or later) regardless of whether the foetus is delivered dead or alive. This includes anomalies identified by prenatal ultrasound, amniocentesis or examination of the products of conception after elective or spontaneous abortion. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post-study pregnancy AND considered by the investigator to be reasonably related to the investigational vaccine(s)/product(s) will be reported to Pfizer as described in Section 8.3.2. While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information from former study participants, he/she may learn of a pregnancy through spontaneous reporting. and pregnancies 8.2.1. Time period for detecting and recording adverse events, serious adverse events and pregnancies All AEs starting within 30 days following administration of the dose of study vaccine must be recorded into the appropriate section of the eCRF, irrespective of intensity or whether or not they are considered vaccination-related. The time period for collecting and recording SAEs will begin at study start and will end 6 months following administration of the study vaccine dose for each subject. See Section 8.3 for instructions on reporting of SAEs. All SAEs should be collected and recorded following administration of the study vaccine dose up to 6 months after. SAEs that are related to the investigational vaccine and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy will be collected and recorded from the time of the receipt of study vaccine until the subject is discharged from the study. In addition to the above-mentioned reporting requirements and in order to fulfil international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study participation (i.e. protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing therapy) will be collected and recorded from the time the subject consents to participate in the study until she/he is discharged from the study. All AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study will be collected and recorded from study start. The time period for collecting and recording pregnancies will begin from administration of the study vaccine dose and will end 30 days following administration of the study vaccine. See section 8.3 for instructions on reporting of pregnancies. Occurrences of NOCIs (e.g. auto-immune disorders, asthma, type 1 diabetes, allergies) will be recorded from administration of the study vaccine dose until 6 months after administration of the study vaccine, whether or not they are considered to be possibly related to vaccine administration. Medical documentation of the events will be reported either as an unsolicited AE or as an SAE as appropriate in the eCRF. Occurrences of GBS will be recorded from administration of the study vaccine dose until 6 months after administration of the study vaccine. Clinical details should be obtained as outlined in the ‘Potential immune mediated disorders: standard questionnaires and list of preferred terms’. All occurrences of GBS have to be reported as SAEs. An overview of the protocol-required reporting periods for AEs, SAEs, and pregnancies is given in Table 14. C0921004 (MenACWY-TT-100 EXT:027 Y6,7,8,9,10, 200171) Protocol Amendment 2 Table 14 Reporting periods for adverse events, serious adverse events and pregnancies C0921004 (MenACWY-TT-100 EXT:027 Y6,7,8,9,10, 200171) Protocol Amendment 2 1 Vacc.: vaccination; Post-vacc.: post-vaccination. 2 NOCI = new onset of chronic illness(es) (e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma type I diabetes and allergies [a non-exhaustive list of NOCIs is provided in Table 13). These AEs are collected from Month 126 through Month 132. 3 Occurrence of meningococcal disease should be documented in the SAE report in the eCRF during the entire study period. 4 Including SAEs related to study vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy occurring from the subject’s last persistence visit to study entry in study MENACWY-TT- 100 EXT: 027 Y6, 7, 8, 9, 10 will be recorded. Subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be questioned at study entry of study MENACWY-TT-100 whether any SAEs occurred during that time frame.5This will also include SAE(s) leading to the withdrawal of the subject from the study. 6 In the event of GBS, subjects should be contacted to obtain clinical details as outlined in the ‘Potential immune mediated disorders: standard questionnaires and list of preferred terms’. All occurrences of GBS have to be reported as SAEs. 7 Pregnancies occurring between vaccination (Day 0) and 31 days after vaccination (Day 30) will be recorded. If, after having been vaccinated, a subject is found to have been pregnant at vaccination, the pregnancy will be recorded as an exclusion criterion. Subjects will be questioned at Month 132, 6 months after the booster vaccination, whether any unreported pregnancies occurred between Day 0 and Day 30 and these pregnancies will be recorded retrospectively. A post-study AE/SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE reporting period defined in Table 14. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the investigational vaccine/product, the investigator will report the event to Pfizer. 8.2.3. Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events 8.2.3.1. Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse events As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject or the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) should be asked a non-leading question such as: ‘Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine or since the previous visit?’ ‘Has your child acted differently or felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine or since the last visit?’ When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the eCRF. The investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to Pfizer instead of appropriately completing the CRF/paper SAE report as applicable the eCRF. However, there may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by Pfizer. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to Pfizer. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 8.2.3.2. Assessment of adverse events 8.2.3.2.1. Assessment of intensity The intensity of the following solicited AEs will be assessed as described: *Fever is defined as temperature  37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or  38.0°C for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral. The maximum intensity of local injection site redness/swelling will be scored as follows: 0 : None 1 : > 0 -  20 mm 2 : > 20 -  50 mm 3 : > 50 mm The maximum intensity of fever will be scored as follows for oral/axillary or tympanic route: 0 : < 37.5 °C 1 :  37.5 °C -  38.5 °C 2 : > 38.5 °C -  39.5 °C 3 : > 39.5 °C The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The assessment will be 1 (mild) = An AE which is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. 2 (moderate) = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities. 3 (severe) = An AE which prevents normal, everyday activities Such an AE would, for example, prevent attendance at work/school and would necessitate the administration of corrective therapy. An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 3 is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre- defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2. 8.2.3.2.2. Assessment of causality The definitions for ‘NO’ and ‘YES’ have been written in such a way that all events that have been attributed a ‘NO’ can be pooled with events which in the primary vaccination study were determined to be ‘not related’ or ‘unlikely to be related’ to vaccination. Those events that are attributed a ‘YES’ can be pooled with those events that in the past were determined to have a ‘suspected’ or ‘probable’ relationship to vaccination in the primary vaccination study. The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational vaccine/product and the occurrence of unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) and for general solicited AEs. The investigator will use clinical judgement to determine the relationship. Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the investigational vaccine/product will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the SRSD to determine his/her assessment. There may be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to Pfizer. However, it is very important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to submission of the SAE report to Pfizer. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and update the SAE information accordingly. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. In case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines, it may not be possible to determine the individual vaccines. All solicited local (injection site) reactions will be considered causally related to vaccination. Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by the investigator using the following question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the investigational vaccine/product? YES : There is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine(s) contributed to the AE. NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the administration of the study vaccine(s). There are other, more likely causes and administration of the study vaccine(s) is not suspected to have contributed to the AE. If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 8.1.2), additional examinations/tests will be performed by the investigator in order to determine ALL possible contributing factors for each SAE. Possible contributing factors include:  Medical history.  Other medication.  Protocol required procedure.  Other procedure not required by the protocol.  Lack of efficacy of the vaccine, if applicable.  Erroneous administration.  Other cause (specify). 8.2.3.3. Assessment of outcomes The investigator will assess the outcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study as:  Recovered/resolved.  Recovering/resolving.  Not recovered/not resolved.  Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae.  Fatal (SAEs only). For each solicited and unsolicited symptom the subject experiences, the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be asked if he/she /the subject received medical attention defined as hospitalisation, or an otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel for any reason, including emergency room visits. This information will be recorded in the CRF/paper SAE report as applicable in the eCRF. 8.3. Reporting of serious adverse events, pregnancies, and other events 8.3.1. Prompt reporting of serious adverse events, pregnancies, and other events SAEs, including those due to GBS and invasive meningococcal disease, that occur in the time period defined in Section 8.2 will be reported promptly within the timeframes described in Table 16, once the investigator determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a SAE. Pregnancies that occur in the time period defined in Section 8.2 will be reported promptly within the timeframes described in Table 16, once the investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy. Table 16 Timeframes for submitting serious adverse event, pregnancy and other events reports * Timeframe allowed after receipt or awareness of the information. 8.3.2. Completion and transmission of SAE reports Once an investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a study subject, the investigator (or designate) must complete the information in the paper SAE report WITHIN 24 HOURS. The SAE report will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event. Even if the investigator does not have all information regarding a SAE, the report should still be completed within 24 hours. Once additional relevant information is received, the report should be updated WITHIN 24 HOURS. The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report. 8.3.3. Completion and transmission of pregnancy reports Once the investigator becomes aware that a subject is pregnant, the investigator (or designate) must complete the required information onto the EDP report WITHIN 24 HOURS. Note: Conventionally, the estimated gestational age (EGA) of a pregnancy is dated from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) of the cycle in which a woman conceives. If the LMP is uncertain or unknown, dating of EGA and the estimated date of delivery (EDD) should be estimated by ultrasound examination and recorded in the pregnancy report. 8.3.4. Updating of SAE and pregnancy information after freezing of the subject’s eCRF When additional SAE and pregnancy information is received after freezing of the subject’s eCRF, new or updated information should be recorded on a paper report, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator. The updated report should be faxed to Pfizer within the designated reporting time frames specified in Table 16. 8.3.5. Regulatory reporting requirements for serious adverse events The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to Pfizer in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section 8.3.1. Pfizer has a legal responsibility to promptly notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of other subjects are met. Investigator safety reports are prepared according to the current Pfizer policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator safety report is prepared for a SAE(s) that is both attributable to the investigational vaccine/product and unexpected. The purpose of the report is to fulfil specific regulatory and GCP requirements, regarding the product under investigation. 8.4. Follow-up of adverse events, serious adverse events, and pregnancies 8.4.1. Follow-up of adverse events and serious adverse events 8.4.1.1. Follow-up during the study After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject’s condition to Pfizer (within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to Table 16). recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until the end of the study. All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until 30 days after the last vaccination. NOCIs and GBS documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until six months after the vaccine dose. 8.4.1.2. Follow-up after the subject is discharged from the study The investigator will follow subjects:  with SAEs, or subjects withdrawn from the study as a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, or until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up.  with other AEs (i.e NOCIs), until 6 months after the study vaccine (M132) or they are lost to follow-up. If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previously reported SAE, he/she will provide this information to Pfizer using an SAE and/or EDP report as applicable. Pfizer may request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognised follow-up period, Pfizer will be provided with any available post-mortem findings, including histopathology. 8.4.2. Follow-up of pregnancies Pregnant subjects will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. At the end of the pregnancy, whether full-term or premature, information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to Pfizer using the EDP report and the SAE report if applicable. Generally, the follow-up period doesn’t need to be longer than six to eight weeks after the estimated date of delivery. Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study, if the pregnancy outcome is a SAE, it should always be reported as SAE. Treatment of any AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current good medical practice. Any medication administered for the treatment of an AE should be recorded in the subject’s eCRF (refer to Section 6.5). 8.6. Subject card To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study-related medical questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, subject study numbers, contact information for the investigational site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subject’s participation in the study. The contact number can also be used by investigational staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The contact number is not intended for use by the subject directly, and if a subject calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigational site. 9. SUBJECT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL 9.1. Subject completion A subject who returns for the concluding visit/is available for the concluding contact foreseen in the protocol is considered to have completed the study. A subject who completes a given epoch is considered to have completed the corresponding persistence time point. At each persistence time point the number of subjects completing each persistence visit and the number of subjects withdrawn at each persistence visit will be calculated. 9.2. Subject withdrawal Subjects who are withdrawn because of SAEs/AEs must be clearly distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will follow subjects who are withdrawn as result of an SAE/AE until resolution of the event (see Section 8.4.1.2). Withdrawals will not be replaced. From an analysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study refers to any subject who did not come back for the concluding visit/was not available for the concluding contact foreseen in the protocol. All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will be used for the analysis. A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study when no study procedure has occurred, no follow-up has been performed and no further information has been collected for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact. Investigators will make an attempt to contact those subjects who do not return for scheduled visits or follow-up. Lost to follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the subject after a minimum of 2 documented phone calls, faxes, or e-mails as well as lack of response by the subject to 1 registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the study was made by the subject himself/herself, by the subject’s parent(s) or LAR(s), or by the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:  Serious adverse event.  Non-serious adverse event.  Protocol violation (specify).  Consent withdrawal, not due to an adverse event*.  Moved from the study area.  Lost to follow-up.  Other (specify). *In case a subject is withdrawn from the study because he/she/the subject’s parent(s) has withdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for withdrawal of consent, if specified by the subject, in the CRF. Subjects who are withdrawn from the study because of SAEs/AEs must be clearly distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study as result of a SAE/AE until resolution of the event (see Section 8.4.1.2). A ‘withdrawal’ from the investigational vaccine refers to any subject who does not receive the complete treatment, i.e. when no further planned dose is administered from the date of withdrawal. A subject withdrawn from the investigational vaccine may not necessarily be withdrawn from the study as further study procedures or follow-up may be performed (safety or immunogenicity) if planned in the study protocol. Information relative to premature discontinuation of the investigational vaccine will be documented on the Vaccine Administration page/screen of the eCRF. The investigator will document whether the decision to discontinue further vaccination/treatment was made by the subject himself/herself, by the subject’s parent(s) or LAR(s), or by the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:  Serious adverse event.  Non-serious adverse event.  Other (specify). 10. STATISTICAL METHODS 10.1. Primary endpoint Immunogenicity with respect to the components of the investigational vaccine six, seven, eight, nine and ten years after primary vaccination in study MenACWY-TT-027:  rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY antibody titres 1:8, 1:128 and GMTs. 10.2. Secondary endpoint(s) Persistence phase: Immunogenicity with respect to the components of the investigational vaccine six, seven, eight, nine and ten years after primary vaccination in study MenACWY-TT-027:  hSBA-MenA, hSBA-MenC, hSBA-MenW-135 and hSBA-MenY antibody titres 1:4, 1:8 and GMTs. Booster phase: Immunogenicity with respect to the components of the investigational vaccine one month post booster vaccination at ten years after primary vaccination:  rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY antibody titres 1:8, 1:128 and GMTs and rSBA booster response. and GMTs and hSBA booster response. Safety and reactogenicity Persistence phase:  Occurrence of serious adverse events related to vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy (i.e. meningococcal disease) since the last persistent time point the subject participated in up to each yearly visit in the current study in a retrospective manner. Booster phase  Occurrence of solicited local and general symptoms on days 0-3 following the booster vaccination.  Occurrence of unsolicited symptoms up to 31 days following booster vaccination.  Occurrence of all serious AEs, and new onset chronic illness(es) (e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma, type 1 diabetes and allergies) from administration of the vaccine dose until study end. 10.3. Determination of sample size The actual sample size of this study with respect to the analysis of persistence and safety and immunogenicity post-booster is determined by a) the sample size of the primary vaccination study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658), b) by assumptions about the enrolment rate at the Year 6- 10 extension study, and c) by assumptions about the annual dropout rate. All subjects who were vaccinated in study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658) and received either MenACWY-TT vaccine, Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY in study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658) will be eligible for this study if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Six hundred and thirteen subjects (460 in the ACWY-TT group and 75 in the MenCCRM group and 78 in the MenPS group) were enrolled and vaccinated in study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658). An enrollment rate equivalent to approximately 80% of the vaccinated population in study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658) is assumed, and an annual dropout rate of 10%. If one assumes approximately 10% of subjects dropping out of the persistence study at every visit, then one expects the following numbers of subjects to participate at each persistence time point.  For the analysis at Year 6, it is estimated that approximately 488 subjects will be enrolled (183 in the ACWY<2, 183 in the ACWY2 group, 61 in the MenCCRM group and 61 in the MenPS group)  For the analysis at Year 7, it is estimated that approximately 440 subjects will be enrolled (165 in the ACWY<2, 165 in the ACWY2 group, 55 in the MenCCRM group and 55 in the MenPS group) (150 in the ACWY<2, 150 in the ACWY2 group, 50 in the MenCCRM group and 50 in the MenPS group)  For the analysis at Year 9, it is estimated that approximately 360 subjects will be enrolled (135 in the ACWY<2, 135 in the ACWY2 group, 45 in the MenCCRM group and 45 in the MenPS group)  For the analysis at Year 10, it is estimated that approximately 326 subjects will be enrolled (122 in the ACWY<2, 122 in the ACWY2 group, 41 in the MenCCRM group and 41 in the MenPS group) The primary objective of this study is to evaluate at 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years after primary vaccination of MenACWY-TT or Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY, the long term persistence of antibodies induced by MenACWY-TT vaccine as compared to Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY when administered at 1-10 years of age in terms of the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8, ≥ 1:128 and GMTs. Table 17 illustrates the accuracy one can expect from a sample size of evaluable subjects at year 6, at year 7, at year 8, at year 9 and at year 10 for evaluation the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8 in each group. rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8 [ 83.4 ; 94.8 76.9 ; 97.3 ] 100 [ 97.0 ; 100 ] [ 91.4 ; 100 ] A total of 7 cohorts are defined for the purpose of analysis. 10.4.1. Persistence cohorts 10.4.1.1. Total cohort at Month X The Total cohort at Month X will include all vaccinated subjects in the vaccination stage of study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658) who return for the Month X follow-up. For the analysis of persistence, this will include all vaccinated subjects for whom data concerning persistence endpoint measures are available. 10.4.1.2. According-To-Protocol (ATP) cohort for persistence – MenC at Month X Analysis of persistence of MenC antibody titres for Month X will be done on ATP cohort for persistence – MenC at Month X.

Derived and transformed data  For a given subject and a given immunogenicity measurement, missing or non-evaluable measurements will not be replaced. Therefore, an analysis will exclude subjects with missing or non-evaluable measurements.  The cut-off value is defined by the laboratory before the analysis and is described in Section 5.7.3.  A seronegative subject is a subject whose titre is below the cut-off value.  A seropositive subject is a subject whose titre is greater than or equal to the cut-off value.  The Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) calculations are performed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log titre transformations. Antibody titres below the cut-off value of the assay will be given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off value for the purpose of GMT calculation.  rSBA booster response for serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y after the vaccine dose is defined as:  For initially seronegative subjects (pre-vaccination titer below the cut-off of 1:8): rSBA antibody titers  1:32 one month after vaccination, and  For initially seropositive subjects (pre-vaccination titer  1:8): rSBA antibody titers at least four times the pre-vaccination antibody titers, one month after vaccination.  hSBA booster response for serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y after the vaccine dose is defined as:  For initially seronegative subjects (pre-vaccination hSBA titre below 1:4): hSBA antibody titres ≥1:8 one month after vaccination, and  For initially seropositive subjects (hSBA titer 1:4): a 4-fold increase in hSBA titres one month after vaccination. 10.5.1. Persistence analyses 10.5.1.1. Analysis of demographics/baseline characteristics Demographic characteristics of each study cohort will be tabulated: age (in years) at Month X and months since the primary vaccination at persistence time point, gender, and geographic ancestry. The mean age [in years] (at the persistence time point [with the range and standard deviation]) as well as the proportion of males and females will be calculated and presented by group. whole and per group and reason for not attending a visit at Month X among all subjects who participated in the primary vaccination study MenACWY-TT-027 (108658) will be summarized. 10.5.1.2. Analysis of persistence For each Month X: The analysis of antibody persistence for MenC will be based on the ATP cohort for persistence – MenC – adapted for each time point. The analysis of antibody persistence for MenA, MenW-135 and MenY will be based on the ATP cohort for persistence – MenAWY – adapted for each time point. If, for any vaccine group, the percentage of subjects who come back for the Month X follow-up with serological results excluded from the ATP cohort is higher than 10%, a second analysis based on the Total Vaccinated Cohort Month X will be performed to complement the ATP analysis. 10.5.1.2.1. Within group analysis For each treatment group, at each blood sampling time point, for each antigen assessed:  Geometric mean antibody titres (GMTs) with 95% CIs will be tabulated.  Percentages of subjects with titres above the proposed cut-offs with exact 95% CIs will be calculated.  The distribution of antibody titres will be tabulated and also presented using reverse cumulative curves. 10.5.1.2.2. Between group analysis An exploratory evaluation of the differences in the immune response at approximately 78, 90, 102, 114 and 126 months after the primary vaccination will be performed in terms of:  Differences in the percentage of subjects with rSBA titres ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 and hSBA titres ≥1:4 and ≥1:8 between the ACWY2 and MenPS (primed) groups, with their standardized asymptotic 95% CIs for the four serogroups and the differences in the percentage of subjects with rSBA-MenC titres ≥1:8 and ≥1:128 and hSBA-MenC titres ≥1:4 and ≥1:8 between the ACWY2 and MenCCRM (primed) groups with their standardized asymptotic 95% CIs.  Ratio of GMTs between the ACWY2 and MenPS groups for the four serogroups and the ratio of MenC GMTs between the ACWY2 and MenCCRM (primed) groups, with their standardized asymptotic 95% CIs. This will be performed using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model on the logarithm transformation of the titres using the vaccine group and 10 age stratum as covariates. Modelling prediction In order to complement the descriptive analyses of observed persistence per time point and minimize the bias that may have occurred due to the loss to follow-up after the vaccination, a longitudinal analysis will be performed at the last persistence time point before booster Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 10.5.1.3. Analysis of safety (Persistence epoch) At each persistence time point, all reported SAEs related to vaccination and any event related to lack of vaccine efficacy since the last persistent time point the subject participated in up to each persistence visit in the current study will be described in detail in a retrospective manner. 10.5.2. Post-booster analyses 10.5.2.1. Analysis of demographics/baseline characteristics Demographic characteristics of each study cohort will be tabulated: age (in years) at booster vaccination, gender and geographic ancestry. The mean age [in years] (at the booster time point [with the range and standard deviation]) as well as the proportion of males and females and of each geographic ancestry will be calculated and presented by group. The distribution of subjects among the study sites will be tabulated as a whole and per group. 10.5.2.2. Analysis of post-booster immunogenicity The analysis of post-booster immunogenicity for MenC will be based on the Booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity - MenC. The analysis of post-booster immunogenicity for MenA, MenW- 135 and MenY will be based on the Booster ATP cohort for immunogenicity - MenAWY. If, for any vaccine group, the percentage of subjects who come back with serological results excluded from the Booster ATP cohort is higher than 10%, a second analysis based on the Booster Total Vaccinated Cohort will be performed to complement the Booster ATP analysis. 10.5.2.2.1. Within group analysis For each treatment group, at each blood sampling time point (Month 126 and Month 127), for each antigen assessed:  GMTs with 95% CIs will be tabulated.  Percentages of subjects with titres above proposed cut-offs and booster response (M127) with 95% CIs will be calculated.  The antibody titres will be tabulated and also presented using reverse cumulative curves. 10.5.2.3. Analysis of post-booster safety The primary analysis will be performed on the Booster Total Vaccinated Cohort and, if more than 10% of the enrolled subjects are eliminated from the Booster ATP cohort for safety a second analysis will be performed on the Booster ATP cohort for safety to support the analyses of the Booster Total Vaccinated Cohort. For each treatment group, after the booster vaccination administered at Visit 5: The percentage of subjects with at least one local adverse event (solicited and unsolicited), with at least one general adverse event (solicited and unsolicited) and with any adverse event during the 4-day (Days 0-3) solicited follow-up period will be tabulated with exact 95% CI. The same calculations will be performed for symptoms rated as grade 3 and for symptoms related to vaccination. The percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited local (any grade, grade 3, medical advice) and general (any grade, grade 3, related, grade 3 and related, medical advice) adverse event during the 4-day follow-up period (Days 0-3) after vaccination and its exact 95% CI will be tabulated. Occurrence of fever will also be reported per 0.5°C cumulative increment as well as the percentage of subjects with oral temperature >39.5°C. Additionally, large injection site reactions will be described in detail. The verbatim reports of unsolicited symptoms will be reviewed and the signs and symptoms will be coded according to the MedDRA Dictionary for Adverse Reaction Terminology. The percentage of subjects with unsolicited symptoms within 31 days post vaccination (Days 0-30) and its exact 95% CI will be tabulated by group and by MedDRA preferred term. Similar tabulation will be done for grade 3 unsolicited symptoms, for unsolicited symptoms possibly related to vaccination and for grade 3 unsolicited symptoms possibly related to vaccination. chronic illness within one month following vaccination will be tabulated with exact 95% CI. The percentage of subjects using concomitant medication (any medication, any antipyretic/analgesic, any antipyretic/analgesic taken prophylactically, respectively) during the 4- day and 31-day follow-up periods (Days 0-3 and Days 0-30, respectively) after vaccination will be summarized. 10.6. Interpretation of analyses All the analyses will be descriptive with the aim to characterise the immunogenicity within and between study groups. CCI 10.7. Conduct of analyses Any deviations or changes from the original statistical plan outlined in this protocol will be described and justified in the final study report. 10.7.1. Sequence of analyses The persistence analysis will be done in stepwise fashion after the persistence time points for Months 78, 90, 102, 114 and 126 as soon as results are available. The analysis of immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity will be done after the booster time point as soon as results are available for Visit 5 and Visit 6. The analysis will be done on a validated and frozen database. The persistence analyses will be done on as clean as possible data. The analysis for each time point will be reported in separate annex clinical study reports in a cumulative manner. The final report containing all persistence, post-booster, and ESFU endpoints will be done on fully cleaned data. 10.7.2. Statistical considerations for interim analyses No statistical adjustment for interim analyses is required. 11. ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS To comply with ICH GCP administrative obligations relating to data collection, monitoring, archiving data, audits, confidentiality and publications must be fulfilled. Remote Data Entry (RDE), a validated computer application, will be used as the method for data collection. In all cases, subject initials will not be collected nor transmitted to Pfizer. Subject data necessary for analysis and reporting will be entered/transmitted into a validated database or data system. Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with applicable Pfizer standards and data cleaning procedures. While completed eCRFs are reviewed by a Pfizer or a designee Site Monitor at the study site, omissions or inconsistencies detected by subsequent eCRF review may necessitate clarification or correction of omissions or inconsistencies with documentation and approval by the investigator or appropriately qualified designee. In all cases, the investigator remains accountable for the study data. The investigator will be provided with a CD-ROM of the final version of the data generated at the investigational site once the database is archived and the study report is complete and approved by all parties. 11.2. Study Monitoring Pfizer or designee will monitor the study to verify that, amongst others, the:  Data are authentic, accurate, and complete.  Safety and rights of subjects are being protected.  Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol, any other study agreements, GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents. The investigator must ensure provision of reasonable time, space and qualified personnel for monitoring visits. Direct access to all study-site related and source data is mandatory for the purpose of monitoring review. The monitor will perform a RDE review and a Source Document Verification (SDV). By SDV we understand verifying RDE entries by comparing them with the source data that will be made available by the investigator for this purpose. The Source Documentation Agreement Form describes the source data for the different data in the RDE. This document should be completed and signed by the site monitor and investigator and should be filed in the monitor’s and investigator’s study file. Any data item for which the documentation agreement form. For RDE, the monitor will mark completed and approved screens at each visit. Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study, the monitor will conduct site closure activities with the investigator or site staff, as appropriate, in accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and Pfizer procedures. 11.3. Record retention Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all site study records (except for those required by local regulations to be maintained elsewhere) in a safe and secure location. The records must be easily accessible, when needed (e.g. audit or inspection), and must be available for review in conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and staff. Where permitted by applicable laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format other than hard copy (e.g. microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is taken. The investigator must ensure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy of the original and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including re-generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the investigator must ensure that an acceptable back-up of the reproductions exists and that there is an acceptable quality control procedure in place for making these reproductions. Pfizer will inform the investigator/institution of the time period for retaining these records to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. However, the investigator/institution should seek the written approval of the sponsor before proceeding with the disposal of these records. The minimum retention time will meet the strictest standard applicable to a particular site, as dictated by ICH GCP, any institutional requirements, applicable laws or regulations, or Pfizer standards/procedures; otherwise, the minimum retention period will default to 15 years. The investigator/institution must notify Pfizer of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, but not limited to archival at an off-site facility, transfer of ownership of the records in the event the investigator leaves the site. 11.4. Quality assurance To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, Pfizer may conduct a quality assurance audit. Regulatory agencies may also conduct a regulatory inspection of this study. Such audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the investigator and institution agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues. and publication policy Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with applicable local laws/regulations.

EudraCT Pfizer posts EU Basic Results on EudraCT for all Pfizer-sponsored interventional studies that are in scope of EU requirements. EU Basic Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary completion date for studies in adult populations or within 6 months of the primary completion date for studies in pediatric populations. www.pfizer.com Pfizer posts Public Disclosure Synopses (clinical study report synopses in which any data that could be used to identify individual patients has been removed) on www.pfizer.com for Pfizer- sponsored interventional studies at the same time the US Basic Results document is posted to www.clinicaltrials.gov 11.6. Provision of study results to investigators Pfizer supports the exercise of academic freedom and has no objection to publication by principal investigator of the results of the study based on information collected or generated by principal investigator, whether or not the results are favorable to the Pfizer product. However, to investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity to review any proposed publication or other type of disclosure of the results of the study (collectively, “Publication”) before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed. The investigator will provide any publication to Pfizer at least 30 days before they are submitted for publication or otherwise disclosed. If any patent action is required to protect intellectual property rights, the investigator agrees to delay the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days. The investigator will, on request, remove any previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for any study- or Pfizer product-related information necessary to the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study results. If the study is part of a multicenter study, the investigator agrees that the first publication is to be a joint publication covering all study sites, and that any subsequent publications by the principal investigator will reference that primary publication. However, if a joint manuscript has not been submitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the study at all participating sites, the investigator is free to publish separately, subject to the other requirements of this section. For all publications relating to the study, the institution will comply with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II - “Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. Publication of study results is also provided for in the clinical study agreement (CSA) between Pfizer and the institution. In this section on publications by investigators, the defined terms shall have the meanings given to them in the CSA. If there is any conflict between the CSA and any Attachments to it, the terms of the CSA control. If there is any conflict between this protocol and the CSA, this protocol will control as to any issue regarding treatment of study subjects, and the CSA will control as to all other issues. 11.7. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) by an applicable competent authority in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any new information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the study vaccine, Pfizer should be informed immediately. by the investigator to protect the study subjects against any immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of. 12.
